General Notes on Assignment:\\
-To learn how to start using Latex I used:\\ 
\url{http://www.latex-project.org}\\
-I was very excited to use Latex, and that it is very useful for writing, but after using it I am not sure, it took some time to get hang of it and I believe it takes more time to write and edit instead of simply writing in word! But who knows only time will till.\\
-To get Github working I figured out how to get my own page set up, and asked 'Sawoods' help to learn to upload my work\\
