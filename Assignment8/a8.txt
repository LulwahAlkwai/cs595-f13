Assignment #8
Due: 11:59pm Nov 14

(10 points)

The goal of this project is to use the basic recommendation principles
we have learned for user-collected data. You will modify the code
given to you which performs movie recommendations from the MovieLense
data sets.

The MovieLense data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research
Project at the University of Minnesota during the seven-month period
from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998. It is available
for download from http://www.grouplens.org/node/73

There are three files which we will use:

1.  u.data: 100,000 ratings by 943 users on 1,682 movies. Each
user has rated at least 20 movies. Users and items are numbered
consecutively from 1. The data is randomly ordered. This is a tab
separated list of 

user id | item id | rating | timestamp

The time stamps are unix seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC.

Example:

196	242	3	881250949
186	302	3 	891717742
22	377	1 	878887116
244	51	2 	880606923
166	346	1 	886397596
298	474	4 	884182806
115	265	2	881171488

2.  u.item: Information about the 1,682 movies. This is a tab
separated list of

movie id | movie title | release date | video release date | IMDb URL | unknown | Action | Adventure | Animation |Children's | Comedy | Crime | Documentary | Drama | Fantasy | Film-Noir | Horror | Musical | Mystery | Romance | Sci-Fi | Thriller | War | Western |

The last 19 fields are the genres, a 1 indicates the movie is of
that genre, a 0 indicates it is not; movies can be in several genres
at once. The movie ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.

Example:

161|Top Gun (1986)|01-Jan-1986||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Top%20Gun%20(1986)|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0 
162|On Golden Pond (1981)|01-Jan-1981||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?On%20Golden%20Pond%20(1981)|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0 
163|Return of the Pink Panther, The (1974)|01-Jan-1974||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Return%20of%20the%20Pink%20Panther,%20The%20(1974)|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| 0|0|0|0|0

3.  u.user: Demographic information about the users. This is a tab
separated list of:

user id | age | gender | occupation | zip code

The user ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.

Example:

1|24|M|technician|85711 
2|53|F|other|94043 
3|23|M|writer|32067 
4|24|M|technician|43537 
5|33|F|other|15213

The code for reading from the u.data and u.item files and creating
recommendations is described in the book Programming Collective
Intelligence (check email for more details). You are to modify
recommendations.py to answer the following questions. Each question
your program answers correctly will award you 10 points. You must
have the question answered completely correct; partial credit will
only be awarded if your answer is very close to the correct one.

1.  What 5 movies have the highest average ratings? Show the movies
and their ratings sorted by their average ratings.

2.  What 5 movies received the most ratings? Show the movies and
the number of ratings sorted by number of ratings.

3.  What 5 movies were rated the highest on average by women? Show
the movies and their ratings sorted by ratings.

4.  What 5 movies were rated the highest on average by men? Show
the movies and their ratings sorted by ratings.

5.  What movie received ratings most like Top Gun? Which movie
received ratings that were least like Top Gun (negative correlation)?

6.  Which 5 raters rated the most films? Show the raters' IDs and
the number of films each rated.

7.  Which 5 raters most agreed with each other? Show the raters'
IDs and Pearson's r, sorted by r.

8.  Which 5 raters most disagreed with each other (negative
correlation)? Show the raters' IDs and Pearson's r, sorted by r.

9.  What movie was rated highest on average by men over 40? By men
under 40?

10. What movie was rated highest on average by women over 40? By
women under 40?

Your output should clearly indicate the answers from the question
you answered.  Provide any relevant discussion.
