Assignment #10
Due: 11:59pm Dec 12 2013

Support your answer: include all relevant discussion, assumptions,
examples, etc.

1.  Choose a blog or a newsfeed (or something similar with an Atom
or RSS feed).  It should be on a topic or topics of which you are 
qualified to provide classification training data.  Find something
with at least 100 entries.  

Create between four and eight different categories for the entries
in the feed:

examples: 

work, class, family, news, deals

liberal, conservative, moderate, libertarian

sports, local, financial, national, international, entertainment

metal, electronic, ambient, folk, hip-hop, pop

Download and process the pages of the feed as per the week 12 
class slides.

2.  Manually classify the first 50 entries, and then classify (using
the fisher classifier) the remaining 50 entries. Report the cprob()
values for the 50 titles as well.  From the title or entry itself,
specify the 1-, 2-, or 3-gram that you used for the string to
classify.  Do not repeat strings; you will have 50 unique strings.
For example, in these titles the string used is marked with *s:

*Rachel Goswell* - "Waves Are Universal" (LP Review) 
The *Naked and Famous* - "Passive Me, Aggressive You" (LP Review)
*Negativland* - "Live at Lewis's, Norfolk VA, November 21, 1992" (concert)
Negativland - "*U2*" (LP Review)

Note how "Negativland" is not repeated as a classification string.

Create a table with the title, the string used for classification,
cprob(), predicted category, and actual category.

3.  Assess the performance of your classifier in each of your
categories by computing precision and recall.  Note that the
definitions are slightly different in the context of classification;
see:
