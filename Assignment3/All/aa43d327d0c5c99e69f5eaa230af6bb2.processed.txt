   What Ancient Greek Rhetoric Might Teach Us About New Civics Blog Image

   A great deal of our conversation lately has focused on getting
   governments to open up their data and to share what they know with the
   general public. We are beginning to see a larger trend emerge -- much
   of the thinking of the power of technology to transform societies,
   especially societies in the developing world, focuses on government
   transparency. I think this focus is deeply important, but I also think
   it's an incomplete way to understand the space of technology and social
   change. We need to understand not just governments and transparency,
   but the rights and responsibility of citizens. This moves us from the
   realm of government transparency and into the realm of civics.

   You may, or may not, share my sense that civics -- our responsibilities
   and practices as citizens, locally and globally -- are changing, in
   part due to changes in the media environment. We are moving out of a
   broadcast era and into an era of participatory media. Broadcast is
   still important and powerful. There are good reasons we're paying close
   attention to the current troubles of the BBC because authoritative
   voices that reach huge audiences matter intensely. But we are also at a
   moment where many of us are creating and sharing acts of speech every
   day. It seems likely that a shift from a culture where a few, very
   powerful institutions speak, to one where everyone can speak but there
   are battles for verification, for influence, and for attention, is a
   key shift likely to change how we participate.

   This shift towards a more participatory civic dialog, sometimes called
   a network public sphere, may have broad implications for how we govern
   ourselves. It's possible that we are moving from a particular model of
   highly professionalized representative democracy, enabled by broadcast
   media, towards a form of more open and direct participation, based on
   participatory media. Whether you find this exciting or scary has a lot
   to do with how enthusiastic or scared about government you are, and
   whether your goal is to increase the legitimacy of governments or to
   challenge and transform those governments.

   My colleague at MIT[27] Ed Schiappa studies rhetoric, and like any good
   academic, can make a link from what he studies to whatever subject
   we're talking about. But Ed came to visit the [28]Center for Civic
   Media and made a compelling case that civics in an age of participatory
   media points to the revival of rhetoric.

   If your instinctive response is to reject this idea, it's probably
   because you've got a bad impression of rhetoric, which is Plato's
   fault. Plato saw a fundamental conflict between rhetors, who spoke to
   persuade, and philosophers, who sought out the truth. You may remember
   Plato's allegory of the cave, where people were shackled underground,
   able only to see shadows cast on a wall by actors moving in front of a
   fire. In Plato's view, Philosophers were those who figured out the true
   nature of the universe, not the flickering shadows they cast, while
   rhetors were content to manipulate those shadows and make them more
   persuasive. Plato believed that very few of us escape our cognitive
   shackles and understand the nature of the universe, but those few who
   do are qualified to rule as philosopher kings.

   The guy Plato was arguing with was Isocrates, who had founded the first
   permanent academy in Athens. That academy taught rhetoric, which
   Isocrates defined as the production of public discourse. He was
   preparing men (only men, and only a few elite men) to participate in
   the public sphere of the time and teaching not only techniques of
   persuasion, but logical argument, the structure of government and the
   other information his students would need to carry out their duties as
   citizens. Because the public sphere at that point was an oral public
   sphere, this meant his students learned to debate and persuade, towards
   the goal of becoming effective citizens participating in public life.

   Preparing people to make public speeches seems a little dated. We live
   in a world where representative democracy is more common than direct
   democracy and where broadcast media has a great deal of power. We often
   think of our "civic responsibility" in terms of educating ourselves on
   the issues and voting, rather than seeking to solve problems ourselves,
   and persuade others of our preferred solutions. Our models for teaching
   civics often focus on informing citizens and preparing them to vote,
   not on helping citizens understand different levers of power and
   different theories of change. But I think that's starting to change.

   We're seeing people engage in campaigns of mass persuasion using social
   media. Some are campaigns designed to support democratic processes,
   like the Nigerian [29]Enough is Enough campaign. Others are focused on
   lobbying on specific issues. One that's received a massive amount of
   attention -- Invisible Children's Kony2012 campaign --[30] is one that
   I've been very critical of, but it's certainly worth trying to
   understand their scale and impact. Invisible Children wanted to show
   that there was a constituency of people who wanted to see Joseph Kony
   brought to justice, and they unleashed a flood of tweets and Facebook
   posts to drive people to an online video. The video was watched 100
   million times in under a week, nine times as often as the most popular
   television broadcast in the US. Congress took note and has provided
   what Invisible Children and allies were asking for: a continued US
   military presence in Uganda. There's lots that was wrong with their
   strategy. For example, it's unclear if it will ultimately lead to
   Kony's arrest, and the focus on the Lord's Resistance Army has angered
   many Ugandans who don't see Kony's arrest as a major priority for
   Uganda on the international stage. Still, the campaign was clear
   evidence that individuals can marshal a great deal of attention and
   have political influence, perhaps even if the theory of change was no
   more sophisticated than "let's make noise and someone will give us the
   change we want".

   I'm also seeing a form of civics that focuses on solving problems
   independent of the government. One of the most interesting outgrowths
   of the Occupy movement is [31]Occupy Sandy, which is helping hurricane
   relief in areas where FEMA has fallen short, [32]distributing supplies
   from two churches in Brooklyn, and using a wedding registry on Amazon
   to collect more than $100,000 of donated supplies. Movements like
   Occupy -- and like the anti-austerity movements in Europe -- are often
   highly skeptical of the state, but are moving beyond critique to use
   digital tools to coordinate DIY efforts. At the same time, we're seeing
   the emergence of "civic crowdsourcing" using Kickstarter and other
   platforms to enable people in a community to fund local projects like
   parks and community centers, sometimes in cooperation with local
   governments, sometimes independently of them.

   The rise of these strains of activism -- activism via harnessing
   attention and through coordinating DIY responses -- probably are not a
   complete replacement for civic participation in representative
   democracy. But it's possible that they're an effective complement,
   particularly at moments where people have little faith in the state,
   either due to understandable frustration with governments in Greece or
   Spain, or due to living in closed societies. Learning the mechanics of
   the Tunisian government wasn't all that useful to the activists who
   overthrew the Ben Ali regime; learning to use media as an activist tool
   and to build their own institutions independent of the state was far
   more transformative.

   If we want to prepare people to be effective citizens, we need to think
   about teaching this new civics as well as older forms of civic
   participation. Citizens need to do more than watch or read about the
   issues and then vote. They need to know how to report, to advocate, to
   coordinate, to propose and test solutions. In the open government
   movement, we often focus on bringing the best practices from the US and
   the UK to the developing world. In the world of new civics, it's
   possible that the lessons we need to learn come primarily from the
   developing world and from closed societies, where people have been
   forced to learn these tactics and techniques.

   Here are some of the lessons we might teach to help people be effective
   civic actors using participatory media.

   The simple act of dissent can be powerful:
   In a society like Ethiopia, where the media is heavily state controlled
   and censored, the ability to write online may be the only way to
   criticize the government. In the case of Ethiopia, speaking out often
   leads to arrest and imprisonment. But the imprisonment of figures like
   [33]Eskinder Nega, an independent journalist who's been sentenced to 18
   years in prison for "treason", has called international attention to
   Ethiopia's dreadful human rights record. And we're seeing brave
   individuals step up and share their voices, like the bloggers behind
   [34]Zone 9, a new blog dedicated to freedom of speech in Ethiopia.
   (Zone 8 is the wing of Ethiopia's most notorious prison, where
   journalists and political prisoners are held, so Zone 9 is a step
   beyond that system of control.)

   Amplifying voices makes them more powerful:
   The protests in Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia would probably have been snuffed
   out, like earlier protests in the city of Gafsa. Instead, they spread
   throughout the country and ultimately took down Ben Ali's government.
   Sidi Bouzid's protests were documented, posted to Facebook, translated
   and [35]contextualized by activists at Nawaat, and amplified by Al
   Jazeera, which helped other Tunisians see what was taking place and
   join in the protest movement. This has lessons for us in the power of
   documenting grievances and our responses to them, in curating and
   contextualizing for a wider audience, and in learning to use broadcast
   media to create broader audiences and build popular movements.

   Small acts can build a coherent, influential whole:
   [36]Ushahidi began as a project designed to ensure that stories of
   individual Kenyans affected by post-election violence didn't go
   unheard. It's turned into something even more powerful - a platform
   that tells stories through pointillism, turning small, individual
   reports into a broader picture.

   Sometimes, the state is listening:
   [37]Ipaidabribe is a crowdsourcing platform designed to document
   bribery in India. As with Ushahidi installations, it's designed to give
   a picture of a broad phenomenon through individual reports. But
   sometimes those individual reports can lead to action: recently, a
   Bangalore-based software engineer was shaken down for a bribe when
   bringing an expensive kayak into India from the US. He used the
   platform [38]to post a report, and the [39]customs official was
   censured and suspended. It's not always possible for people to post
   signed reports, as this engineer did, nor is it always possible to
   verify anonymous reports. But creating spaces where people can post
   about mistreatment and demand government response is a way of using
   extra-governmental systems to pressure the state.

   We can propose interventions and converge on solutions:
   My colleague Yochai Benkler has been conducting extensive research on
   the success of the anti-SOPA/PIPA movement in the US, and offers the
   idea that what made the movement so powerful was the fact that lots of
   actors were able to propose possible protest actions. Movement actors
   voted by amplifying proposals they liked and ignoring (or criticizing)
   others. The success of protests like the Wikipedia blackout came about
   after a long process of convergence on paths forward.

   Using Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms for civic solutions
   leverages the same mechanisms: many people can propose problems and
   solutions, and a group can vote -- this time with contributions -- on
   which they think are most worthy. There are [40]cautions about this
   method, but the idea of converging on possible solutions is an exciting
   one.

   I've not seen great solutions to some more complicated civic problems,
   notably the problem of distributed deliberation, which was a core
   practice of Athenian rhetoric. In general, we're pretty bad at bringing
   people on the Internet together in civil conversations. But we may be
   getting closer to this ideal (and who knows how often conversations in
   the agora descended into flame wars?) through learning how to produce
   media that shares our perspectives and learning how to reflect
   constructively on others' ideas. We are starting to see some promising
   offline solutions, like [41]participatory budgeting, which asks a group
   to come together in a formal process to solve a well-defined problem:
   the allocation of a fixed set of resources to community problems.

   If we're starting to learn lessons about what works, we may also be
   learning how we'd teach this new civics. We'd study how laws are
   passed, but also how online and offline campaigns pressure lawmakers.
   We'd talk about courts and elections, but also about the media and
   popular movements. We'd focus on learning how to write, to advocate, to
   film, to amplify. We'd work on tools and techniques to coordinate
   efforts and to solve problems together. If we change our assumptions,
   we're no longer focused on preparing people to vote for their
   representatives, but to be active participants in their society,
   whether or not it's an open and democratic society.
