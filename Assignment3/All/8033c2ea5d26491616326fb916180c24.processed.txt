Was ESPN sloppy, naive or compromised?

   So what's more damaging to a corporate image: to be considered sloppy,
   naïve or compromised? Or all three? You get to pick in the wake of
   ESPN's announcement Thursday that it was removing its brand from an
   upcoming two-part documentary by PBS's "Frontline" that "reveals the
   hidden story of the NFL and brain injuries" (or so it claims in a
   [23]controversial trailer).
   The ESPN action drew immediate media and mailbag accusations that the
   NFL had pressured the network into severing ties to the PBS films. I
   thought the best and briefest characterization came from Ombuddy Philip
   Berenbroick of Arlington, Va., who saw ESPN's decision as an example of
   "the dueling journalism and profit motives [via protecting valued
   partners] at the network."
   It's hard to argue with that depiction. That duel also turns out to be
   the major ongoing conflict that the ombudsman deals with. This column
   is a first response to the current issue; there may be more columns to
   come as we learn more on the topic.
   The background: For the past 15 months, ESPN's enterprise/investigative
   unit has been working "in collaboration" with "Frontline" on two shows
   scheduled to air in October. They are titled "League of Denial: The
   NFL, Concussions and the Battle for the Truth," and are in parallel
   with a [24]forthcoming book of the same name by Steve Fainaru and Mark
   Fainaru-Wada -- brothers and investigative reporters for ESPN.
   By all accounts, it has been a close and happy collaboration between
   elite news teams, producers and writers. Results of that collaboration
   have already appeared on ESPN.com and "Outside the Lines," the ESPN
   show that most closely resembles the PBS show in serious intent, as
   well as on the "Frontline" site. Indeed, ESPN has done extensive
   reporting on the NFL and concussions, from its "[25]Football at a
   Crossroads" series to revealing reports by Fainaru and Fainaru-Wada on
   concussion controversies involving [26]Mike Webster and [27]Junior
   Seau.
   There were mutual corporate benefits. PBS would draw new viewers from
   the crowds in the ESPN grandstand, and ESPN would derive a dash of PBS
   prestige from its association with one of the nation's most respected
   documentary broadcasts. Both sides trumpeted the relationship. In July
   2012 at the [28]Aspen Ideas Festival, on a panel with PBS president
   Paula Kerger, ESPN president John Skipper said: "We're not the public
   trust that PBS is, but we do a certain amount of programming that is a
   bit of the public trust."
   That attitude was a point of pride among ESPN journalists, including
   Dwayne Bray, a senior news producer who was working closely with
   "Frontline." On Aug. 6, on a joint media panel with "Frontline" in Los
   Angeles to promote the documentary, Bray took on the question of ESPN
   reporting on the toughest topic bedeviling its most important business
   partner. Pro football is the most popular sport on ESPN and generates
   the most income. But the NFL is also dealing with more than 4,200 named
   player-plaintiffs in lawsuits over concussion-linked injuries.
   At a news conference on the tour, Bray boasted of ESPN's "bifurcated"
   structure in which journalism and business remained separate. He
   pointed out that ESPN has been reporting on football concussions since
   1994, and that "the NFL is just going to have to understand" the nature
   of the ESPN-"Frontline" partnership.
   That event, Skipper told me, was for him "the catalyst or starting
   episode" of what ultimately resulted in ESPN's decision to part ways
   with "Frontline." Skipper didn't attend the event, and said he was
   "startled" when he read about a promotional trailer for the documentary
   which was screened at the news conference. He hadn't seen the trailer
   or approved its content, which included the ESPN logo and a
   collaboration credit. He thought it was "odd for me not to get a heads
   up," and said it made him "quite unhappy" to discover that ESPN had no
   editorial control over the trailer.
   Upon screening it, Skipper said he found the trailer to be
   "sensational." He particularly objected to the tagline -- "Get ready to
   change the way you see the game" -- and to the final sound bite in the
   piece, from neuropathologist Ann McKee. Referring to brain injuries,
   she says, "I'm really wondering if every single football player doesn't
   have this."
   Skipper said he found that comment to be "over the top."
   Eight days after the catalytic news conference, on Aug. 14, Skipper and
   NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had lunch in New York City. It's not
   hard to assume, as many have, that Goodell raised issues about the
   "Frontline" documentary and demanded that Skipper take some action to
   protect the NFL brand.
   Commissioners are always trying to strong-arm or sweet-talk ESPN
   executives, especially Skipper. How well they succeed is a matter of
   constant speculation, both among Ombuddies and from some inside ESPN.
   Right or wrong, there is a perception that the company's decisions --
   both long-term and moment-by-moment -- are often made to promote, or at
   least not provoke, important "partners."
   When I spoke to Skipper on Friday and told him that my sources
   indicated he had discussed the "Frontline" partnership with Disney
   chairman and CEO Bob Iger, as well as lawyers at both Disney and ESPN,
   he confirmed that was true. Skipper noted, however, that he had made
   the calls to advise those parties of his decision to "remove the brand
   because we did not control the content." He denied that anyone at
   Disney or the NFL demanded the action.
   Said Skipper, "I am the only one at ESPN who has to balance the
   conflict between journalism and programming."
   ESPN's public reasoning for separating from "Frontline" was tied to
   oversight, with the network saying "Because ESPN is neither producing
   nor exercising editorial control over the Frontline documentaries,
   there will be no co-branding involving ESPN on the documentaries or
   their marketing materials." On Friday, Skipper released a statement of
   editorial support, saying "I want to be clear about ESPN's commitment
   to journalism and the work of our award-winning enterprise team. We
   will continue to report this story and will continue to support the
   work of Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru. We have respect as well
   for the efforts of the people at `Frontline.' "
   Which takes us back to the challenge of ESPN's "dueling journalism and
   profit motives." What exactly happened here, and how should we feel
   about it?
   If, as Skipper told me, the ESPN-"Frontline" association was "a loose
   arrangement," it seems an unusually sloppy execution for ESPN, an
   organization that is usually much more buttoned-up. (Raney Aronson, the
   deputy executive producer for "Frontline," told me the arrangement was
   more of an "editorial exchange" and that "we were working on a piece of
   paper" -- meaning some legal memorialization of the partnership.)
   Was attention not being paid at ESPN? Too much time spent acquiring
   tennis rights, the SEC, Keith Olbermann, Nate Silver and Jason
   Whitlock, and not enough on journalism?
   Was ESPN naïve about the relationship with a hard-driving documentary
   unit whose viewership, not to mention its bottom line, was not invested
   in football? Was it also naïve to fail to anticipate the inevitable
   reaction from the NFL, which from the beginning had pointedly refused
   to cooperate with "Frontline" (no league footage, no Goodell interview,
   limited access to doctors who advise the NFL on concussions)? The
   league was not happy with a [29]recent OTL report on one of its main
   doctors -- which ran on ESPN's platforms just last weekend -- so why
   would it support "League of Denial"?
   Or did ESPN cave in to pressure from the NFL or Disney or both? And if
   so, really, what was the point? It couldn't have been to stifle
   interest in the project. The media coverage of ESPN's decision to
   remove its imprimatur from the "Frontline" films will probably result
   in both a sales and ratings boost for the book and documentaries,
   respectively.
   So what just happened? Beats me. At best we've seen some clumsy
   shuffling to cover a lack of due diligence. At worst, a promising
   relationship between two journalism powerhouses that could have done
   more good together has been sacrificed to mollify a league under siege.
   The best isn't very good, but if the worst turns out to be true, it's a
   chilling reminder how often the profit motive wins the duel.
   This is a dicey time for the journalism side of the ESPN bifurcation.
   For all the current fuss, an even stronger message than ESPN's
   disassociation from the "Frontline" project was the network's recent
   decision to reschedule the Sunday morning OTL show from 9 a.m. on ESPN
   to 8 a.m. on ESPN 2 during the fall. A justifiably proud show is being
   demoted ... for more football talk!
   I'll be staying on this story, as circumstances warrant, but will leave
   you for now with both foreboding and optimism.
   "It's sad because it sounds like a terrible blow for journalism at
   ESPN," Sandy Padwe, a Columbia journalism professor, said of ESPN's
   breakup with "Frontline." Padwe, who recently ended a hitch of almost
   19 years as a consultant to OTL, added that many journalists inside of
   ESPN are "demoralized by the capitulation and so much fine work is
   being marginalized."
   But Bray, the producer who has been among several in the forefront of
   the concussion investigations for ESPN, told me, "This issue is about
   branding, not about journalism. We will still get to do the stories,
   and no one will interfere with that."
   Let's hope so.
