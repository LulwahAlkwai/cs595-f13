   If Syrian Counterattack Takes Out US Grid having a generator could make
   all the difference. Thanks to @JLivens
   After reading up on how fragile our power grid is (apparently it is
   largely surviving on a hope and a prayer anyway) I've started actively
   planning to put a generator at my home. A number of my peers have
   either done this or moved to off-grid solar. The attached post below
   talks about how to pick a generator and could come in handy as an
   initial step to addressing this problem. I plan to go whole house and
   Propane myself unless I can find a Diesel generator that is more cost
   effective (in case natural gas distribution fails as well, which it
   could under the Syrian counter attack scenario).
