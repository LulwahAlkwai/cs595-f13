[4]Current Daylight saving time policies are insane

   [5]Daylight saving time (DST) is this insane practice whereas twice a
   year, clocks are moved forward or backward by an hour. It is still
   widespread throughout North America and Europe.

   As a kid, I was told that this was meant to help farmers. But farmers
   have traditionally opposed daylight saving time (though they no longer
   do). The real argument is that daylight saving time saves energy.

   Does it really save energy? This is disputed somewhat:

     We estimate a cost to Indiana households of $9 million per year in
     increased electricity bills. We also estimate social costs of
     increased pollution emissions between $1.7 to $5.5 million per year.
     ([6]Kotchen and Grant, 2011)

   What is not disputed is that the change to daylight saving time
   increases significantly heart attacks:

     Overall, we found an elevated incidence ratio of 1.039 (95%
     confidence interval, 1.003-1.075) for the first week after the
     spring clock shift forward. The higher risk tended to be more
     pronounced among individuals taking cardiac medications and having
     low cholesterol and triglycerides. ([7]Janszky et al. 2012)

   But if daylight saving time part of the year saves energy, wouldn't
   year-long daylights saving time saves even more? Many people think so
   (e.g., see [8]Ahuja and SenGupta, 2012).

   The objections to a permanent switch to daylight saving time comes from
   parents who fear that dark morning might increase accidents involving
   kids. Yet the evidence that daylight saving time is bad for students
   does not stand.

   Thus, [9]Calandrillo and Buehler conclude that it is time to switch
   year-round daylight saving time:

     (...) year-round daylight saving time would save hundreds of lives
     annually by decreasing motor vehicle and pedestrian fatalities.
     Furthermore, extra light in the evening hours reduces criminal
     activity and results in energy savings from decreased peak
     electricity demand. Finally, year-round daylight saving time would
     eliminate the negative effects caused by the current spring and fall
     time changes. (...)

   I see no evidence in favor of the current system. It is insane.

   If you are American, [10]please sign the petition to stop this
   insanity.

    1. Daylight Saving Time is one of those things that has never been
       convincingly explained in any of the near forty years I've been
       alive. No one I've met likes it, yet it's something everyone goes
       along with because "that's the way we've always done it".
       Speaking as someone who has to manipulate time with a computer, I
       can tell you that I would gladly welcome the demise of DST.

    2. Thank you, very interesting. From now i can be more happy that
       Arizona doesn't have time saving.

    3. The GMT/BST debate always strikes me as a completely false
       spectacle. It is the unthinking obedience to "Captain Clock" that
       should be called into question.
       If you don't like dark mornings, why not show up later at work?
       Ah!
       Scientific evidence shows that teenagers learn better from 11am
       also? So why does school start at nine?
       Ah!
       Because the point is not the time, or the amount of daylight, but
       that you learn to OBEY! The clocks going forward and back twice a
       year really is a "Jump? Yessir! How high?" phenomenon.
       Anyone with insufficient autonomy to reject social time and live
       their life at a chosen latitude according to the astronomical time
       prevailing there is bound to be somewhat oppressed and therefore
       somewhat depressed.

    4. What about adjusting our watches twice a year? ;) This is annoying
       too!

    5. I've lived in Arizona for five years now and I hate not changing
       the clocks. The problem is work schedules don't change but the time
       my body wants to get out of bed varies greatly throughout the year.
       I realize days are shorter in the winter but it's mitigated
       somewhat by changing the clock. But in Arizona my body wants to get
       out of bed at 4:30 in July and 8:30 in December.

    6. I am a U.S. newcomer from China, and I've felt a little bit tired
       since the start of this DST. I think it is partially because I have
       to adjust my biological clock an hour earlier, which seems to be
       bad for health. China only has one time zone and has never widely
       adopted DST policy, although it is well known for our farm
       products.
       Btw, such petition to the White House is a time-wasting effort if
       understanding the concept of Separation of Powers under the United
       States Constitution.
