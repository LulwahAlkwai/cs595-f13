Newest `Walking' Shark Heralds Brighter Future for Indonesia's Sharks and
Rays

   [77]Dr. Mark Erdmann

   Mark Erdmann was involved in the exciting discovery of a new species of
   "walking" shark, which was announced this week. Today on Human Nature,
   he discusses how this species fits into Indonesia's shifting attitude
   toward shark conservation.

   If you asked me a year ago about the long-term future of shark
   populations in Indonesia, I probably would have responded: "Bleak."

   For nearly three decades, Indonesia has led the world in the export of
   dried shark fins and other products from elasmobranchs (sharks, fins
   and skates). The country averages over 100,000 tons of sharks and rays
   landed each year -- 10-13% of the global catch! In the 21 years I've
   been working in Indonesia, I've seen many of my favorite reefs stripped
   of their shark populations. Indeed, it has become quite rare to see
   sharks on most dives in Indonesia.

   But what an amazing difference a year can make! In that time, I have
   seen Indonesia take incredible steps to protect these fascinating
   species that help keep our oceans healthy -- even if we don't yet know
   of their existence. This week's announcement of the new species of
   "walking" shark can truly be said to herald a promising future for
   Indonesia's sharks and rays.

   Why the sudden about-face from exploitation to conservation and
   sustainable use of elasmobranchs? Without question, the global movement
   toward shark and ray conservation (including recent [78]CITES listings)
   has had an impact, but there are other encouraging forces at play as
   well.

   Increasing Understanding of Sharks' Importance for People

   As Indonesia's economy has matured, the past decade has seen a
   tremendous increase in the number of Indonesians taking up scuba
   diving. This has dramatically increased awareness of the declines in
   shark and ray populations while simultaneously creating a large "fan
   base" for charismatic species like manta rays and whale sharks.

   Within the government, there is a growing awareness of the
   [79]important ecological role that sharks play in maintaining healthy
   fish stocks, as well as the incredible economic potential of shark and
   manta-focused marine tourism. A recent [80]study of global manta
   tourism conducted by the NGOs WildAid, Shark Savers and Manta Trust
   showed that Indonesia ranks second globally as a manta tourism
   destination, with an estimated direct economic benefit of over US$ 15
   million to the Indonesian economy annually.

   As Agus Dermawan, the director of the Ministry's Marine Conservation
   Directorate, notes: "We now know, for instance, that a living manta ray
   is worth up to US$ 1.9 million to our economy over the course of its
   lifetime, compared to a value of only $40-200 for its meat and gill
   rakers. We believe there is still tremendous untapped potential to
   expand shark and ray tourism in Indonesia, but we need to act now to
   manage and recover these populations."

   Indonesia is also one of the world's biggest users of social media.
   Celebrity conservationists like Riyanni Djangkaru (a former news anchor
   and current editor of [81]Divemag Indonesia) are daily raising
   elasmobranch conservation issues through Facebook and the popular
   "#savesharks" Twitter hashtag.

   Scientific Discoveries

   The country's changing view toward sharks and rays is also being
   influenced by the steady stream of exciting scientific discoveries
   emanating from the world's largest archipelagic nation, which seems to
   be bringing new shark and ray species to light every year.

   For instance, the recent discovery of a new species of epaulette or
   "walking" shark (Hemiscyllium halmahera) on the reefs of the remote
   eastern Indonesian island of Halmahera, has the local government and
   emerging dive tourism industry excited to promote its newly-named
   endemic species.

   [EMBED]

   The shark, which has the endearing quality of using its fins to "walk"
   across the ocean floor, calls attention to the fact that the vast
   majority of Indonesia's elasmobranchs are harmless to humans and lead
   fascinating but little-known lives beneath the sea. Indeed, CI has
   chosen the Raja Ampat endemic species of walking shark, locally known
   as kalabia, as the mascot for its [82]flagship marine conservation
   education program there. With a clever strategy, the new walking shark
   could similarly serve as a local ambassador for marine conservation in
   Halmahera!

   At the other end of the size spectrum, my colleague Fahmi, Indonesia's
   foremost shark expert, has now confirmed the first known record of a
   basking shark in Indonesian waters -- indicating this normally
   cold-water species may be using Indonesia's abundant deepwater channels
   to move across the equator between the temperate waters where it feeds.
   In a bid to further increase public awareness and appreciation of the
   country's tremendous national heritage, Fahmi and his colleague
   Dharmadi at the Ministry of Fisheries will also soon be publishing an
   identification guide to the nearly 220 different species of sharks and
   rays known from Indonesian waters.

   Milestones for Shark Protection

   In the past year, Indonesia has made impressive commitments to protect
   its sharks. In February, the Raja Ampat government announced a law
   creating the [83]first shark and ray sanctuary in the [84]Coral
   Triangle, a move which just this past week inspired the West Manggarai
   government (where world-famous Komodo National Park is located) to
   follow suit with their own elasmobranch sanctuary. Now the Bali
   government is also considering creating a sanctuary.

   The story at the national level is similarly promising. In March of
   this year, the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries
   hosted the first national symposium on shark and ray conservation.
   There, the minister himself publicly announced that Indonesia would
   move quickly to create regulations to protect those species whose
   populations are threatened, including those recently listed on
   [85]CITES Appendix II (including reef and oceanic manta rays, oceanic
   whitetip sharks and hammerheads.)

   Since that time, a dedicated coalition of Indonesian scientists and
   government officials, supported by NGOs including CI, the Wildlife
   Conservation Society, WildAid, Manta Trust, The Nature Conservancy and
   WWF have worked hard to gather the scientific evidence to support these
   regulations and design the public consultation process. In June, the
   first of these regulations granting full protected species status to
   [86]whale sharks was signed by the minister, and the team led by the
   ministry and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences is now working
   feverishly to finalize further regulations focused on manta rays, three
   species of hammerhead sharks and oceanic whitetip sharks.

   With all of these promising new developments, my assessment on the
   future of Indonesian sharks and rays has done an about-face from bleak
   to increasingly bright. I look forward to sharing more positive news on
   this initiative in the near future. Until then, as our finned friends
   in Halmahera would say, "Keep walking."

       Actually, the CITES listing is a direct consequence of the
       economical factors you mention; CITES regulations are all about
       economic viability. Not about protecting animals, but about making
       the animals a sustainable resource through protection.
