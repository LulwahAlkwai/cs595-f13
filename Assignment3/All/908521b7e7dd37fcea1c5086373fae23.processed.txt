   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   Steve Ballmer Was a Success With A Bad Publicist. Likely replacement
   named.
   If you consider that Microsoft was a mess when he took it over and the
   major things Ballmer needed to do, he actually got 3 of 4 done. Granted
   one of the 3 late, but he held revenue and profits at incredibly high
   levels while other firms, with Apple being the noted exception doing
   far worse. The one thing he missed on was mobile devices but name one
   company, including IBM, that got that right other than Apple initially
   (and Apple drove it) even Palm and Blackberry were caught flat footed.
   However Ballmer didn't manage his, or Microsoft's, image well and as a
   result he'll likely be, and this is unfortunate, remembered more for
   his few failures than his many successes. In ChannelLine today:
