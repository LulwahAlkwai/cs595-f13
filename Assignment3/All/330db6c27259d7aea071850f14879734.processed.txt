Hands-on With iPhone 5S

   [48]Apple unveiled the next-generation [49]iPhone at its headquarters
   in Cupertino, Calif. on Tuesday. The [50]iPhone 5S -- revealed
   alongside a low-cost iPhone model, the [51]iPhone 5C -- keeps the same
   overall physical design as the previous-generation [52]iPhone 5, but it
   also has a number of upgrades.

   Calling it the most "forward-looking" iPhone it's ever launched, Apple
   equipped the iPhone 5S to run 64-bit apps (all previous models ran at
   32 bits) thanks to a new processor: the Apple A7. It packs more than 1
   billion transistors into a 102mm chip. Apple has re-engineered all the
   built-in apps -- such as Mail, Calendar and Music -- for 64-bit
   architectures.

   See also: [53]Top 25 Free iPhone Apps of All Time

   Apple says the new chip makes the iPhone 5S five times faster than the
   iPhone 5 and 56 times faster than the original iPhone. The A7 chip
   supports OpenGL 3.0/ES Version 3.0 for console-level 64-bit graphics.
   The upcoming [54]Infinity Blade III will be one of the first games to
   take advantage of the upgrade to deliver improved graphics.

   The iPhone 5S introduces a CoreMotion API for developers --
   consolidating sensor data from the accelerometer, gyroscope and compass
   -- powered by a co-processor called the M7. Apple says it's "optimized
   for contextual awareness," such as when the user is in a moving
   vehicle. Apple says the system will empower a new generation of health
   and fitness apps.

   One of the major additions to the hardware is a [55]fingerprint sensor
   in the home button, which enables a feature called [56]Touch ID. The
   iPhone 5S scans the fingertip of the person pressing the button,
   eliminating the need for a lock code. Touch ID also means the end of
   the repeated ritual of entering your Apple ID password every time you
   download a new app.

   The fingerprint sensor, which has a protective layer of durable
   sapphire crystal, can store multiple fingerprints and read them from
   any orientation. They all reside, encrypted, on the A7 chip.

Major Camera Improvements

   The iPhone's camera is also improved with a new image sensor with 15%
   more area. The Apple-designed lens comprises five elements and has an
   f/2.2 aperture. It's still an 8-megapixel camera, so the larger sensor
   translates into bigger pixels that are backed by upgraded
   image-processing software that automatically sets white balance and
   exposure level in a dynamic, local tone map of the image.

   As predicted, the camera is equipped with a dual-LED flash. The two
   LEDs have different color temperatures, illuminating a scene with warm
   and cold light to draw out more natural color. The iPhone's camera also
   now includes a burst mode that snaps 10 still pictures in one second
   with automatic image stabilization. Panorama photos go up to 28
   megapixels.

   Finally, the iPhone 5S camera is capable of capturing HD video at 120
   frames per second (fps). The increased frame rate enables a slow-motion
   mode.

Gold!

   Apple is injecting a little more color into its flagship phone as well.
   The iPhone 5S will be available in silver, "space gray" and now
   champagne gold, marking a change from previous generations, which were
   available only in white (or silver) and black.

   Battery life is rated as follows: 10 hours 3G talk, 8 hours 3G
   browsing, 10 hours LTE or Wi-Fi browsing, 10 hours video playback, 40
   hours music playback and 250 hours standby.

   The iPhone 5S has virtually the exact same shape as the iPhone 5, at
   4.87 x 2.31 x 0.3 inches, and it weighs 3.95 ounces.

   Surprisingly, the iPhone 5S does not support 802.11ac Wi-Fi, a
   "forward-looking" feature of the Samsung Galaxy S4 and other Android
   smartphones.

   The iPhone 5S is actually the seventh iPhone model Apple has ever
   unveiled. It keeps with Apple's general pattern of altering the design
   of the iPhone once every two years -- the last big physical change
   coming in last year's iPhone 5.

   The iPhone 5S will go on sale Sept. 20 in nine countries: the United
   States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and the UK.
   Like previous generations, it will come with 16, 32 or 64GB of storage
   for $199, $299 and $399, respectively -- as long as you sign a two-year
   contract with AT&T, Verizon or Sprint (T-Mobile's installment pricing
   is somewhat different).

   By December, Apple plans to sell the iPhone 5S in 100 countries on more
   than 270 carriers. Apple will also offer dyed leather cases for $39
   each.

   Although the iPhone 5S and 5C replace the iPhone 5, Apple will continue
   to sell the iPhone 4S -- albeit with just one storage option, 8GB.

   [57]Rumors have swirled around the iPhone 5S for the past year.
   Although competition in the smartphone space has heated up considerably
   in that time, Apple kept to its annual schedule of releasing the new
   iPhone in the fall. The big question is: Will consumers still buy
   Apple's signature product as they used to?

   Corrections: This article originally reported a pre-order date for the
   iPhone 5S, but Apple has not yet announced one for that model. The
   article also initially reported inaccurate colors; the correct colors
   are silver, gray and gold.
