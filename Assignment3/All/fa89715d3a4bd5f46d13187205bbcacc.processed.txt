[4]The irony of "we are the 99 percent"

   [5]David Graeber is credited as the true organizer of the Occupy Wall
   Street movement, a widely reported month-long demonstration against
   capitalism. He has also been credited the phrase "We are the 99
   percent". I have reviewed his insightful book on the [6]history of debt
   and money [7]on this blog shortly after it came out.

   Graeber is an anarchist, and so am I. I think that we should always
   have as little formal organization as we can. So I immediately liked
   Graeber. He has also this whole underdog angle: he was denied tenure at
   Yale despite an impressive public record. I like underdogs! Like
   Graeber, I am upset that our governments bail out the financial sector.
   Bankers think that the world owe them great salaries without any
   possible risk that they might lose their jobs. This is the 1% that
   Graeber was denouncing: people who believe that they are owed great
   things.

   But though I liked Graeber, it soon became clear that Graeber can be
   harsh! When Venkatesh Rao wrote a [8]review of his book, here is how
   Graeber answered: A book is only as good as its readers. In effect, if
   you don't like his book, you are not good. Oh! Oh!

   By itself, such remarks should not be taken as an indication that
   Graeber is a difficult person. It is not uncommon, or even particularly
   unhealthy, to have a big ego as a scholar. I would say that it is
   almost required.

   However, more recently, Graeber publicly [9]complained about his
   so-called academic exile. Indeed, following a denial of his tenure at
   Yale, American and Canadian colleges did not approach David Graeber
   with a job offer. He sent out 17 job applications and got no interview!
   So he had to settle for a professorship at the [10]London School of
   Economics with a salary that surely puts him in the top 1%. These are
   his exact words:

     It's not just that I didn't get a job. 17 applications and no offer
     could have just been a run of bad luck, after all. The remarkable
     thing is that at not one of those 17 places was I even formally
     considered.

   I do understand that the academic job market is bad. It is, to tell the
   truth, rather horrible, especially in the humanities. Simply put, we
   train too many PhDs. Places like Yale can find dozens of great
   anthropologists, as deserving as Graeber. In fact, if you look at the
   web site of the anthropology department at Yale, you will find that
   half of the professors are [11]assistant (non-tenured) professors. This
   means that the job market is such that Yale can afford to hire
   assistant professors, keep them for the duration of their contract and
   then let most of them go.

   Graeber had better luck abroad than in the US. This can be frustrating,
   but it is hardly uncommon. Scholars move around quite a bit: just go to
   your local college and listen to the professors. Many of them are
   foreigners. Having to move to a different country is par for the course
   if you want to be an academic scholar. Yes: sometimes your ideas are
   better received elsewhere.

   Is he being shunned in the US because of his political views? It is
   possible. But before one starts imagining that capitalists are having
   anti-capitalists shunned from American colleges, one has to realize
   that American colleges are overwhelmingly leftist, especially in the
   humanities. And hiring decisions are made by other academics, not
   bankers.

   Graeber did get seven years as a professor in an Ivy League American
   school. Isn't it fair for others to get this chance as well? I would
   think that a fairer system is one where, after you had a good run in
   academia, you have to leave your place to others so that they, too, can
   write books and promote their ideas.

   A fairer system would be also one where you are not allowed to limit
   yourself to the top schools: you have to offer your services to lesser
   colleges (often attended by poorer students). In fact, maybe the Yale
   professors should have to move to second-rate colleges after 7 years.
   This would be fairer, wouldn't it? It would expose poorer students to
   more prestigious professors and I am sure it would help reduce
   inequalities.

   Graeber [12]answered: "I certainly thought of applying to working-class
   universities (...) Everyone told me don't bother (...) they wouldn't
   even look at me."

   A man who genuinely wants to teach working-class kids would apply for
   jobs at public colleges irrespective of what his friends tell him. He
   would not give the impression that he is too good for such a college.
   He would use the full force of his charisma to convince public colleges
   to give him a chance.

   But Graeber is a man who wants to be part of the elite. He wants to
   teach to the children of the 1%, to the children of the bankers. And
   this is also the man behind "we are the 99 percent". It smells of
   cognitive dissonance.

   Of the participants of Occupy Wall Street, very few can afford to have
   Graeber as a professor because he will only work in top schools. How is
   that fair?

    1. Interviewer: So Mr. Graeber, you say bankers are wrong to feel
       entitled to a good job, but academics are not?
       Graeber: First of all, its DOCTOR Graeber, thank you very much. And
       yes, bankers are wrong to feel entitled but academics are not.

    3. Most professors are liberal about things which do not affect them
       and extremely conservative about those things which do. Which may
       be the right thing to be when involved in a system where the number
       of good jobs is decreasing over time, but it is, I think, an
       accurate statement that most departments would look askance at
       political activism, while claiming never to do such a thing.

    4. Graeber is a major anthropologist whose work has received praise
       for its groundbreaking quality throughout his career.
       He has made important contributions to his field, and has written
       books that are broadly influential, and he has considerable
       teaching experience at major universities. it is ludicrously
       shallow to explain away his trouble in finding work with the glib
       `there's too many phds out there' argument when the truth is that
       Yale probably cannot find another Anthropologist as talented as
       Graeber.
       Furthermore, his work with OWS and earlier anti-globalization
       movements is undeniable. Now that OWS is passed he has been one of
       the strongest voices in providing deep analysis of that movement's
       failings. When I've seen or read him interviewed, he's been very
       humble about his role in the movement and was always willing to
       share or pass credit for aspects of the movement on to those who
       deserved it.
       Graeber never complained about having to "settle" for working in
       London, nor did he state he's above working at a `working-class
       college'. You're willingness to project those attitudes onto him,
       though, read more as the bitter envy of someone without his resume
       in academia or in direct action activism.

    5. He's right. Teaching universities would not actually interview him.
       He's obviously interested in research, not teaching, and there are
       hundreds of candidates who are wholly interested in teaching. So he
       would stand no chance.
       As for banking, the problem isn't just that bankers don't lose
       their jobs. It's worse than that: even if they did, they still make
       enough money through bonuses that losing their jobs is not actually
       a penalty. They would have to lose their bonuses retroactively.

       Graeber.
       Really? Are you absolutely sure about this?

       He's right. Teaching universities would not actually interview him.
       There is at least a hundred state colleges in the US where
       professors do leading edge research. One of the key differences for
       these professors is that they also usually teach to kids who are
       not part of the 1%.

    8. @Gregg Weston
       he's been very humble
       I would not describe Graeber as humble. This man has an ego larger
       than my house. I'm not particularly humble myself, by the way.
       Comment by [28]Daniel Lemire -- 18/4/2013 @ [29]8:20
    9. Still don't agree. Any sign that he would be appearing to be
       "settling" for something would instantly doom his application. This
       is because there are also hundreds of candidates who are not
       prominent scholars for the tens of jobs that do come up at
       non-elite colleges, and the colleges would think that those
       candidates wouldn't be ready to leave when a research job came
       along.
       Comment by [30]plam -- 18/4/2013 @ [31]9:15
   10. @plam
       The story we have is this one...
       1. I applied for a job at the elite colleges to teach to the 1% and
       they weren't interested so I went to teach to the British elite...
       ... and not this one...
       2. I applied to hundreds of public colleges because I genuinely
       want to make a difference in the life of regular kids who can't
       afford Yale... alas none of these hundreds of colleges even wanted
       to see me...
       Story 2 is incompatible with a guy who complains that no elite
       school approached him after he was denied tenure at Yale. You are
       totally right that most departments would be very worried about
       recruiting such a diva... because it is inconsistent with a guy who
       wants to teach to working-class kids.
       But that is ironic coming from the guy behind "we are the 99%".
       This is not a man who wants an egalitarian society. This is a man
       who wants to be part of the elite.

   11. Humanities are not sciences... Also economics is a joke most of the
       time, so I dont bother listening to those crackpots...

       :D
       @ Daniel - it is sad that you consider that clown even in your own
       league... You actually do things that make things happen... he
       sells his BS to dumb masses.
       If somebody thinks im too harsh :
       "completed his Ph.D. thesis on magic, slavery, and politics in
       Madagascar."
       Comment by Ivan -- 18/4/2013 @ [35]9:44
   12. @Ivan
       I think his work on Madagascar is maybe less silly than it sounds.
       If I recall, it is all about how the British Empire managed to
       submit a people using currency.
       I do share many of his views. For example, I also think that the
       fact that governments enforce a unique currency through a central
       bank is tool of oppression. I don't think governments should be
       given a monopoly on the currency of the land.
       I don't have a problem at all with the man except that there is a
       marked contrast between his advocacy of an egalitarian society and
       his diva status.

   13. @Daniel
       Im libertarian(thought Schiff link would say so without me saying
       it explicitly :) ) so no need to mention force and government. For
       example I think bitcoin is innovation 1000x bigger than iTunes
       because it provides gold standard without the cost of mining
       minting and guarding gold, but banksters and statists will do
       everything to kill it off, because their profits/power are powered
       by current monetary system
       Regarding our dear anthropologist friend he might call him self a
       anarchist, pope, or alien wizard, but his work is pure liberal
       BS(he supports organization that "The IWW promotes the concept of
       "One Big Union," contends that all workers should be united as a
       social class and that capitalism and wage labor should be
       abolished.")- Im seriously surprised that you cant see that, when I
       hear words like inequality, 99% my pattern matching subsystem works
       very easy. :D
       BTW if you want a good book about what social sciences should be
       covering if they werent pseudosciences:
       [38]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations
       Ofc liberals will call you racist for reading it so be careful. :P
       After all you work in the university so you know if you are edgy
       you are expected to like Graeber, if you arent edgy you are
       supposed to talk all day how poor Obama is fighting for 99%, but
       those evil evil white privileged
       ppl/NRA/Republicans/bankers/Christians/conservatives/weather are
       stopping him.
       P.S. regarding 99%:
       "The problems we face today are there because the people who work
       hard for a living are now vastly outnumbered by those who vote for
       a living. "
       Marc Faber, PhD
       Comment by Ivan -- 18/4/2013 @ [39]10:30
   14. P.S.
       wanting to be part of the elite is not bad, I would like to be rich
       and successful, I just dont want to become that by stealing and
       breaking the law. I want equal rights, but I dont see rights as
       outcomes as liberals do. Wanting to be good and better than others
       is not evil... if it is them Im evil.
       Comment by Ivan -- 18/4/2013 @ [40]10:43
   15. I hate the argument that you can't criticize a system you're part
       of. Graeber can desire a systematic change where the poor would
       have equal access to top universities while not being expected to
       resign his position and give free lectures in the streets. Somebody
       can be both exceedingly rich and advocate for fairer wealth
       distribution. Google can file patents while still calling for
       patent reform.
       Systematic and individual changes are very different things. If
       Graeber works at a community college, that makes a negligible
       impact on social inequality. Warren Buffet voluntarily paying a
       higher tax rate has a miniscule impact on government revenue
       compared with the top tax rate actually being raised.
       Your claim that wanting to teach at an elite school means you want
       to teach the children of bankers strikes me as a slightly bizarre
       view of who attends top universities, but even if we take that at
       face value, what better group to promote social equality to than
       the children of bankers?
