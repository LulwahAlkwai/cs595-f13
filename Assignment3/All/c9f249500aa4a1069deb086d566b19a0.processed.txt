   Summary:

   Yahoo's stock has been on a tear and its chief executive has graced the
   cover of BusinessWeek and the pages of Vogue. Its product re-launches
   have gotten Bieberesque attention. Yahoo loyalists are celebrating. I
   think they are wrong; here is why.

   For past year or so, there has been a bit of a lovefest around Yahoo,
   the rapidly aging former web star that has lost the attention and
   preeminence it enjoyed in the 1990s and early 2000s. The showers of
   praise, prompted in part by the appointment of Marissa Mayer as its
   chief executive officer and her ability to understand the modern web,
   have resulted in oodles of press for the company.

   A year later, that buzz has helped the stock run up almost over 90
   percent -- something that has warmed the cockles of the cold, mean and
   brutal Wall Street crowd. It led the "activist" investor [37]Dan Loeb
   to actively bail out of Yahoo stock and lock in hefty profits.

   It has been a year that has kept the Yahoo press office very busy. And
   it has been a year full of non-critical looks at a company that has
   made news for giving iPhones to its employees, rapping remote workers
   on their knuckles and minor upgrades to once iconic products. Or as a
   cynic (like me) would say -- it is like spraying Chanel No. 5 in a
   pigsty.

   My [39]recent appearance on Bloomberg TV in which I focused on the
   reality of Yahoo has led some -- including Business Insider's Henry
   Blodget, who benefits directly from the largess of Yahoo as a longtime
   shareholder and part time employee  - [40]to ask me to lighten up.

   The problem is that this is precisely the time when one needs to ask
   the tough questions of the company. Yahoo's new CEO is a wonderful,
   intelligent and hard-working executive whose attention to detail and
   product feedback is a much welcome break for the beleaguered company's
   workforce. Her Google-like management moves such as free food and
   quarterly reviews to weed out low performers are good steps. But these
   moves, inspiring as they might be, have not resulted in any real
   products and results.

   And this is not about Marissa, who remains someone I admire deeply. It
   is about the company, its culture and its place on the modern web. It
   is about Yahoo loyalists and their inability to look beyond the
   esoteric and frankly worthless metric; [41]the 700 million people who
   use Yahoo each month. That is a blivet full of 15 year old excrement.

11,700 employees, 1 year, 4 Relaunches

   Yahoo apologists point to the face lifts given to Flickr, Yahoo Mail,
   Yahoo News and Yahoo Weather as achievements for a company that employs
   about 11,700 people. Of course, none of those people point to that fact
   that the number of people (in the U.S.) who use Yahoo Messenger has
   tumbled from over 12.5 million to just over 6 million (based on
   comScore data). Or that (U.S.) visitors to Yahoo Finance are stagnant
   at shade over 34 million -- the same number they were in July 2012.
   Flickr had 25 million (U.S.) users in July 2012 according to comScore,
   a number that had declined to 21.5 million in July 2013.

   Dismiss all that as nitpicking, but you can't ignore the fact that
   [42]according to research firm EMarketer "Yahoo's share of global
   digital ad spending is set to decline from 3.37 percent to 3.1 percent
   this year."

   When I put that forecast against the somewhat ambiguous number of
   [43]Yahoo topping the comScore rankings of most widely used websites I
   see that nothing really has changed. Yahoo's Weather app uses data from
   a third party and it doesn't matter how well it does -- it can't create
   enough views and thus create a meaningful revenue stream.

   I am not the only non-believer. "We continue to believe that a
   turnaround of Yahoo's consolidated operations is a long shot, even if
   Marissa Mayer has improved morale and sharpened Yahoo's focus on
   product aesthetic, functionality and mobile apps," wrote Jordan Rohan,
   who follows the company for brokerage, Stifel & Co., in a recent
   research note to his clients. Jordan is being generous.

   Like [44]I told Bloomberg's Emily Chang, Yahoo's product lineup sort of
   blows. There isn't a single product they make that I want to use.

   Yahoo, like most large web companies from the 1990s, gained mass scale
   because it arrived to the party first and moved fast enough to keep
   signing up more and more people. Of course, it helped that there wasn't
   much competition, especially after the big bubble burst in 2001. Yahoo
   met the needs of a lot of newcomers to the internet by offering simple
   and easy-to-use products. Fast forward to today and we have a whole new
   generation of internet users who have grown up using a plethora of
   services. They understand what is good, what is average and what is
   simply terrible. Yahoo's offerings for this new class of users aren't
   that compelling enough to shift their attention to the company.

   [45]yahoo-reflected-in-eye-o

   It is often easy to look at the web services from the perspective of
   the current/past generation of users and get blinded by the big
   numbers, but technology companies have to look forward and make sure
   they capture new classes of users. It is the challenge faced by every
   single consumer products company -- brands and products age with their
   early adopters and eventually become worthless. As a knowledgeable man
   recently told me, "Yahoo is like the Fat Elvis" when all of us "want a
   new king of rock-n-roll." Buying [46]Tumblr is a good move, but again,
   it's too soon to declare victory.

Mobile first? Actually no, mobile last

   Looking forward, it is pretty clear the world isn't about the web as we
   know it and instead it is all about the mobile. The good news is that
   Yahoo's CEO knows that.

   "I hope that at some point we are looking at a world where mobile is a
   majority of our revenue," Mayer told BusinessWeek [47]writer Brad
   Stone. The bad news is that Yahoo has done nothing to capitalize on
   that opportunity. It has launched some new apps but boy, are they
   struggling in the rankings.

   Take for example the top free 50 iOS apps in the US iTunes App store --
   there is one Yahoo property in there, Tumblr, which cost the company a
   whopping $1 billion. Flickr, whose much ballyhooed rebirth inspired
   headlines across the globe, ranks a mere 39th in the "photos and
   videos" apps. BusinessWeek celebrated Yahoo's focus on new products and
   design, but someone should look at Yahoo Mail -- the font it uses is
   from the 1990s. (Yahoo Mail is ranked at 114 spot on the US iOS App
   Store.) On the US Google Play store, Yahoo Mail is ranked at #19,
   Tumblr at #81 and Yahoo Fantasy Sports League at #109.

   Here is a tiny bit from Bloomberg's piece about Yahoo.

     Cahan's division, called Mobile and Emerging Products, now exceeds
     330 people and has its primary offices in New York, San Francisco,
     and Sunnyvale, Calif. Underscoring mobile's importance, Mayer
     ordered the team's work space in Sunnyvale renovated. Unlike the
     soporific purple and beige cubiclevilles that fill the rest of
     Yahoo's dot-com-era headquarters, the mobile group has adjustable
     workstations that let employees sit or stand. There's an exposed
     ceiling, whiteboards on every other wall, and big colorful posters
     that display giant iPhone screens.

   330 people -- you gotta be kidding me! There is one question that needs
   to be asked: what the hell[48] are these people on Yahoo's mobile team
   doing? What is the daily active user base for Yahoo, and its individual
   products. "We also launched our redesigned Yahoo! app for iOS and
   Android, complete with Summly integration. As a result of this launch,
   we saw 55% increase in daily active users and a 60% increase in time
   spent using the application." Mayer said during the conference call,
   but how about some actual numbers?

   And while Yahoo management talks about mobile from one side of its
   mouth, they are unable to resist the lurid lucre of web-based
   advertising. Perhaps that is why they are out celebrating the comScore
   top spot and looking [49]at signing up Katie Couric to their web
   platform, just as she signed up Saturday Night Live (SNL) to the Yahoo
   platform.  As I see it, for about the 13th year, Yahoo continues to be
   schizophrenic, torn between its desire to be either a media entity or a
   technology company.

Rotten to the core

   I can sit and talk about in this abstract terms, but the fact is that
   Yahoo's core is getting completely hollowed out. According to one Wall
   Street analyst, search-based advertising accounts for about 75 percent
   of company's operating profits, and yet no one seems to notice that
   Yahoo's share of US search queries has declined from 20.3 percent in
   2009 to 11.3 percent at the end of July 2013. In fact, every month is a
   new low.

   [50]Bing and Ballmer By selling its [DEL: search :DEL] crown jewels --
   search -- to Microsoft, the company is more reliant on Microsoft for
   profits than most realize. And all that search-market share loss didn't
   go to Google, but it has been sucked up by Microsoft's Bing which now
   accounts for about 18 percent of the total US search queries, according
   to comScore.

   Things are worse on mobile -- the company doesn't even have a double
   digit share of the mobile search market. Mobile (unlike Yahoo on the
   web) search is driven almost entirely by ability to search inside the
   URL/search bar and most people end up using Google as a default option.
   Google owns Android and has done a good job of becoming an important
   part of iOS users' habits as well. Google's search is slowly and surely
   moving towards offering intelligent serendipity that can drive a new
   revenue stream from action-oriented advertising, the kind which makes
   sense on mobile platforms.

   [51]Yahoo Weather for iOS In comparison, Yahoo is still dependent on
   the old school page-view driven advertising business model. And even
   here, Yahoo is facing a nightmare situation -- thanks to technology in
   the form of programmatic buying. This type of buying is limiting the
   demand of premium advertising that Yahoo has been hawking.

   Yahoo no longer enjoys the monopoly on the massive scale web
   advertising. That mantle has been taken over by Facebook, which, quite
   frankly, has figured out a way to create inventory of billions of page
   views at costs much lower than Yahoo. As a result it offers advertisers
   cheap display advertising but with ability to more effectively pick and
   choose attractive demographics. In other words, with better targeting
   and cheaper prices, why would a display advertiser look at Yahoo over
   Facebook?

   Let's just face it -- there isn't anything premium about Yahoo
   anymore. By the way, this isn't just my theory -- Yahoo blamed
   programmatic buying for the revenue shortfall in its most recent
   quarter (Q2 2013.) And this is a problem that isn't going away,
   especially since Facebook, which throws up tens of billions of page
   views daily, has made making money its sole mission.

So why is Yahoo stock up?

   "All of the stock bump is because of increase in the valuation of
   Alibaba," Ben Schachter, analyst with Macquarie Securities pointed out.
   The positive press and improved image of the company because of Marissa
   has helped the stock. But as far as products are concerned, "we haven't
   seen much." He isn't the only one who is in wait-and-see mode. Other
   analysts too say that there remain substantial challenges.

   While it is easy to say that these things take time, one thing is
   clear: Yahoo doesn't have time. It doesn't have time to move at the
   speed of General Motors in the age of Tesla. It has to learn that when
   it comes to the only thing that matters in the world of consumer
   technology -- attention -- they are losing it to sexier, shinier and
   prettier things.

   And forget the products -- so far Yahoo has been unable to attract top
   quality talent to the company. Not one 20-something I have talked to in
   the past six months has wistfully talked about working for Yahoo. And
   even those who have [52]joined Yahoo from Google are joining the
   company thanks to mega-million dollar contracts, not because they want
   to work there. When Yahoo becomes the desired job-spot for a fresh, new
   tech tinkerer -- that will be the time I will lighten up on Yahoo.

   And in the interim, I am going to focus all my writing on companies
   actually inventing the future. And if anyone from Yahoo management
   wants to come talk to me, I am all ears and they know where to find me
   -- as long as they come with data that shows not only is its audience
   and daily engagement growing, but also its revenues, profits and appeal
   to a new generation of users.

       hm, I love how Om only tells you where Yahoo's apps are located in
       the iOS store, even though that OS accounts for less than a quarter
       of the worldwide OS usage.. where are the Android stats?

            store: Yahoo Mail is ranked at #19, Tumblr at #81 and Yahoo

       Great piece, Om.
       I'm always so confused by the contrast between Marissa Mayer's
       philosophy/aesthetic -- clean, helpful, classy, non-evil -- and the
       Yahoo! frontpage -- Kardassians permanently in the top stories,
       junk stories almost indistinguishable from fake sponsored stories.
       . . .
       It seems like they are too afraid of losing traffic to tinker with
       improving quality, leaving them, like you say, stuck with their
       existing, dwindling market segment.
       While it should still be a platform with a lot of upside,
       especially with the right M&A, I agree that the potential is still
       more unproven than shown.

            Chris
            Many thanks for the comment and yes, you are right about the
            dichotomy of the situation. Yahoo front page has lost all
            meaning and remember I grew up with that page/design and loved
            using it as a service.
            That said, MM has great aesthetic and good taste. I have seen
            it up close at various events, during interviews and during
            casual chats.

       Thank goodness for Om Malik. Mayer is a remarkable executive but
       there's so little there there for the business of Yahoo! Where the
       CEO should get good marks is in turning around perceptions of the
       company so they can retain and maybe even attract good talent.

       One of the "core" products they are applauded for is Yahoo Fantasy
       Football. If Yahoo were investing in its core successes, its
       fantasy app would not have auto-drafted Aaron Hernandez as my TE in
       the 6th round last night, more than a month after he was locked up
       on murder charges and released from his team. There are dozens of
       other players not on any roster for months who still appear in the
       Yahoo Fantasy league. This is not that hard for a company with
       Yahoo's resources who wants to show that they care about investing
       in their "successful" products.
       Disclosure: I sold Yahoo short this morning after discovering they
       had auto-drafted Aaron Hernandez onto my team last night.

       You refer to the millions of Yahoo users as EXCREMENT? Maybe you
       are getting to old to write for the public. S'ok. It happens to the
       best of them.

       This article was extremely frustrating to read:
       "(Yahoo Mail is ranked at 114 spot on the US iOS App Store.) On the
       US Google Play store, Yahoo Mail is ranked at #19, Tumblr at #81
       and Yahoo Fantasy Sports League at #109."
       ARE YOU SERIOUS? These numbers are freakishly misleading because it
       reports them in overall app rankings, but instead we should be
       looking at them by each category in which they are published. For
       example:
       Yahoo! Mail (Productivity category): #5
       Yahoo! Weather (Weather category): #2
       Yahoo! Sports (Sports category): #13
       Yahoo! Fantasy Football (Sports category): #2
       (these ranks are as of of Aug 22, 2013 on iOS App Store, U.S.)
       ..the list goes on, but you see what I'm trying to say here? This
       article is written by a total nonsense skeptic.
       Enjoy,
       -Yahoo! employee who monitors rank and app marketing everyday and
       truly believes in the company's vision

            Free App category (overall) is the right way to look at the
            reality of your company
            1.Google Gmail at #22 overall not in some special productivity
            category.
            2. Instagram #7 overall, not some special photos category.
            3. Weather Channel #92 overall.
            Tell you what you have
            Tumblr and Yahoo Fantasy Sports app -- 52 and 67 overall -- of
            which one cost $1 billion.
            I am glad the company has a lot of believers like you -- it
            needs that blind support. I am not a believer and I am a
            skeptic -- why don't you guys prove me wrong. Simple

            Yahoo is doomed with their current direction in mobile. Their
            "feedback" link is overwhelmingly filled with boisterous
            complaints about their "new" approach in mobile where they
            lock in floating yahoo toolbars taking up a significant
            portion of your phone and tablet screen with no ability to
            remove it in settings. Users are screaming at them online,
            even begging them to remove it, yet all are ignored. Moronic
            lack of attention to customer satisfction and user experience.
            Then when one reads the user comments posted to their own
            yahoo new articles you realize their market share appears to
            be populated in large part by the very bottom of the market.

            To Rushabh - so if you work at Yahoo, see my comment above. If
            you want to see your company succeed, do something to turn
            this "new" mobile direction around in terms of the horrible
            user experience! Just go to your own feedback section and you
            will see what I am talking about.
