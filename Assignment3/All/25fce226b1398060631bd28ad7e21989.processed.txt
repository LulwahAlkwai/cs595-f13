Typing stealth: a review of the CODE Keyboard

Coding Horror designs a keyboard for those of us who never stop typing.

   The Code Keyboard, designed by Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror.

   Two and a half years ago, I [9]fell in love with a mechanical keyboard.
   It was comfortable to use but profoundly loud, to the point of being
   obnoxious. It was audible across rooms and through walls and into the
   night--not to me, with my headphones on, but to most living, breathing
   souls within a 50-yard radius.

   Jeff Atwood of Coding Horror appears to know the dilemma of perpetual
   typists like myself. We love our mechanical keyboards with Cherry MX
   switches, but they sound off like so many M16 rifles. One of the
   leading features of [10]his new CODE keyboard is that it is "quiet,"
   but it packs a handful of other quirks meant to streamline usage for
   heavy duty users.
   The sound of Not Even Close To Silence

   The keyboard is a pretty spare design, with translucent legends on the
   keys that allow individual-key backlights to shine through. The body is
   weighted to keep it from shifting around on your desk, and this one is
   hefty enough to stay put through minor earthquakes: the 87/88-key
   version is two pounds and the 104/105-key version we reviewed is 2.42
   pounds.

   A single microUSB-to-USB cord connects and powers the keyboard. My
   usual keyboard has two supplementary USB ports that I missed after
   swapping in the CODE keyboard.

   [12]Enlarge / The USB cord threads most easily straight out the back,
   but a series of channels allow users to thread off to either side along
   the top edge or off the left or right side.
   [13][code-keyboard-7-640x426.jpg]
   [14]Enlarge / Rubber feet keep the (very heavy) keyboard in place.

   Atwood designed the CODE keyboard as the answer to all of the
   touch-screen typing we now do. Touch-screen keyboards have their place,
   but for an honest day's worth of typing in the life of a writer,
   programmer, or even just a heavy-duty Internet user, capacitive glass
   (or even rubber domes or scissor switches) simply will not do.

   The CODE keyboard uses Cherry MX Clear mechanical switches, which are
   stiff compared to the more common Cherry MX Blues and Browns. Because
   of this, the keyboard somewhat mimics the feel of a rubber dome
   keyboard like the ever-popular Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard.
   [15][code-keyboard-8-640x426.jpg]
   [16]Enlarge / One of the Cherry MX Clear switches, accompanied by the
   individual backlight bulb for the key.
   But the mechanical switches are superior to the rubber dome switches in
   two ways. First, they activate before they are pressed all the way down
   (you can feel a tactile bump at this actuation point). Your finger
   doesn't have to "bottom out" the key in its well in order to get the
   key press to register.

   Second, they are less susceptible to aging and do not become harder to
   strike over time as soon as rubber dome switches do. The average
   lifespan of rubber domes are around five million presses, while
   mechanical switches go 10-20 million. If the switches are used right, a
   keyboard like this should, in theory, both prevent fatigue and sustain
   a longer lifespan than a cheaper rubber dome keyboard.

   I am now a longtime user of a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Blue
   switches, an Adesso MKB-135B that won my heart after it appeared in
   [17]a video I did about keyboards a couple of years ago. It's not the
   fanciest of models and is branded a "gaming" keyboard when, in fact, it
   uses switches that are actually considered optimal for typing as
   opposed to gaming (Cherry MX Browns are the reigning champs there,
   though these are all matters of preference more than anything).

   To my Blue-accustomed hands, the Clears felt pretty stiff. At first
   this seemed like a downside, surely it would result in more fatigue
   than usual. But a problem I often have with my Blues keyboard is that I
   don't type delicately enough to distinguish between the activation
   point and bottoming out. Half the time I'm hammering away and I strike
   the key all the way down and move on. Sometimes I can maintain the
   featherlike touch required to take full advantage, but it's a balance
   that I am sometimes too impassioned about pants or Google+ to maintain.
   [18][code-keyboard-6-640x426.jpg]
   [19]Enlarge / A full bottoming-out depression (front) versus an
   activation depression (behind) on the CODE keyboard.
   The stiffer switches of the Clears do a better job at preventing me
   from bottoming out. I worry that over time my fingers will work up
   enough enthusiasm to start abusing these switches just as badly as they
   do my Blues, but for the time being I'm maintaining a healthy balance
   of pressure.

   The real downside to Cherry MX Blues is their volume. They are
   incredibly, incredibly loud, totally not suitable for an office or
   really any space that doesn't resemble a bunker. Sources who prefer to
   remain nameless tell me my usual keyboard can be heard from outside my
   apartment. This may play a role in why rubber dome keyboards
   proliferate in offices over mechanical or even scissor-switch
   keyboards.

   Cherry MX Clear switches, on the other hand, have a tactile bump, but
   they are not "clicky" like the Blues or Browns. The Clears even sound
   like a rubber dome keyboard.

   The CODE keyboard version we have is part of Atwood's first production
   run, so problems are to be expected to an extent. When I removed the
   keyboard from the box, I noticed that a thin metal hook under the
   backspace key had come undone, leading the key to be partially detached
   and rattle when I pressed it. Reseating that metal hook took a solid 20
   minutes of struggling with a spudger and the included key-puller before
   everything was in place.

   The key puller is a nice inclusion, as it makes the keyboard much
   easier to disassemble and clean. This process otherwise involves prying
   the keys off their switches to somewhat unpredictable results.

   One of the features of the keyboard is six-key rollover (press six keys
   simultaneously and they will all register). This doesn't match the
   10-key rollover of some gaming models, but I didn't run up against the
   limit in my typing experience.

   [23]Enlarge / The DIP switches embedded in the back of the keyboard.

   The keyboard has a set of DIP switches on the back that once
   configured, allow you to switch the keyboard layout on the hardware
   level (instructions aren't included for this, but you have Google and
   some thousands of support forums at hand). The keyboard also arranges
   its media keys differently: rather than being along the function row,
   they are the secondary functions of the Insert/Home/Page Up Cluster,
   with the Menu key functioning as the Fn key. This configuration is
   operable with one hand without a lot of strain.

   At $149.99, the CODE keyboard is on the expensive side for a mechanical
   model (my own was around $80; Das Keyboards are $120-130; keyboards
   with even more offbeat switches like Topres can run upwards of $200).
   This isn't the new Keyboard Everyone Needs, but its considered design
   touches and features will no doubt meet the approval of a certain cadre
   of very, very active typists.
