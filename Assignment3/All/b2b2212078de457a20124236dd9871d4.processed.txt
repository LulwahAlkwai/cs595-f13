Salt Lake City: How a Remote Red-State City Became a Transit Leader

   by [25]Angie Schmitt

   Salt Lake City's transit system is the envy of cities five times its
   size, and it's all because planners listened to what the public wanted.
   Image: [26]Smart Growth America

   It's number one in the nation in per-capita transit spending. The only
   city in the country building light rail, bus rapid transit, streetcars
   and commuter rail at the same time. And that city -- Salt Lake City --
   is a town of just over 180,000 in a remote setting in a red state.

   It's a remarkable story that began in the 1990s, when an organization
   called Envision Utah facilitated a regional visioning process and
   created a plan that has been recognized as one of the most promising
   smart growth models in the nation.

   There's a lesson here for other cities. In 1997, leaders in a 10-county
   region centered on Salt Lake County set out to see what people valued
   about where they lived. They designed a plan around those values, with
   a communications campaign to support it. At that time, the state was
   expected to grow by a million people by 2020. Rather than cede that
   growth to meandering sprawl, the region chose something more orderly
   and compact.

   "At that point, to many Utahns, `smart growth' was not a popular word,"
   said Robert Grow, Envision Utah's president and CEO. "We made people
   some promises. We'd save a lot of time, money, lower emissions, improve
   air quality, develop more housing choices, and build a transportation
   system with greater efficiency."

   The organization interviewed 150 key stakeholders -- elected officials,
   activists, heads of major institutions. And they surveyed some 20,000
   Utahns about their hopes and wishes. Leaders even engaged in an effort
   at "value mapping," to get a sense for local priorities and deeply held
   beliefs as they related to land use and transportation.

   Project leaders discovered Utahns liked the idea of transit more than
   they expected. The Envision Utah effort began shortly after the first
   light rail track was laid in the city, which had been controversial.
   But polling showed 88 percent of residents favored expanding the
   system.

   "There wasn't much energy to go beyond that [first line] until this
   public effort about how we could build a real system," Grow said at a
   session at the Congress for New Urbanism conference, held last week in
   Salt Lake City.

   As a result of the feedback, planners added 300 miles of light rail to
   regional plans and began assembling the right-of-way. Now 70 percent of
   the region's population lives within three miles of a light rail stop.
   A recent study found the Salt Lake City transit system offers
   [27]better job access than that of any other city in the country.
   Regional leaders also point to studies that show local economic growth
   has been more equitable than elsewhere in the U.S., with gains across
   many income levels. The region even exceeded federal air quality
   standards. (Although stricter standards have since knocked the area
   back out of attainment, leaders like Grow say it will soon meet them.)

   Once Salt Lake City leaders knew what people wanted, they embarked on a
   public relations campaign. Dee Allsop of the communications firm Heart
   and Mind Strategies led the effort.

   "How is it that the most conservative state... how is it they're one of
   the most progressive in the country on transit?" said Allsop. "It's
   because the case was made in a way that fit with people's values."

   The values they settled on were to have a city that was "beautiful,
   prosperous and neighborly." This spot is an example of Envision Utah
   messaging.

            IFRAME: [28]http://www.youtube.com/embed/WSNPfQOuCkQ

   The land use plan developed by Envision Utah was voluntary, with no way
   to enforce recommendations -- but it seems to have done the trick. The
   group was able to show that density had a $15 billion public
   infrastructure benefit over sprawling growth. That spoke loudly to
   state and local leaders, Grow and Allsop say. Smart growth principles
   were also the most fiscally responsible.

   "To be sustainable," Allsop said, "a region must satisfy the values,
   hope and dreams of present and future residents."

       It's slightly misleading to say that Salt Lake is a city of
       180,000. The metropolitan area has 1.1 million people, and the
       larger conglomeration of the three metropolitan areas of which Salt
       Lake City is the center contains around 2.3 million inhabitants.

       I just looked up the borders of the city, and they are quite
       strange. It ends somewhere between 2100 S and 3000 S depending how
       far east you go, and the light rail goes far south of there. That
       said, having been there most of the week I can say that it
       definitely feels like a small city most of the time-after 6pm more
       than half the businesses downtown are closed and there's almost no
       one on the streets. It's very odd in a downtown that's been built
       up so much.

       I lived in Salt Lake City for nearly 20 years, and I can tell you
       first hand that the public transit system is a spectacular model of
       success and urban planning. Even when I lived nearly 19 miles
       outside of downtown, I could drive to the end of the light rail
       line (3 miles) and commute inexpensively and very conveniently. In
       the winter, my travel time was often shorter than if I'd driven
       myself on I-15.
       There are a couple details that need to be clarified in this story
       however. First, as mentioned by other posters, the metro Salt Lake
       area is roughly 1.2 million people, with a staggering 16% growth
       rate. This casts a much different picture than "a remote setting in
       a red state" with 180,000 people.
       Second, much of the unrelenting effort to bring in light rail,
       expanded bus service and the other public transportation upgrades
       came from the mayors of Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County. Salt
       Lake City has had a Democrat for mayor since 1976. Their mayor from
       2000-2008 (Ross "Rocky" Anderson) went on to mount a third-party
       presidential run and is recognized as a global authority on both
       environmental issues and human rights. Salt Lake County has been
       slightly more balanced, having had a Democrat as mayor for the last
       9 years, and a Republican for the first 4 years after they
       converted from a county council model to a mayoral model.
       Without doing an exhaustive deconstruction of the region's history
       with regard to public transportation, I can agree that it is a
       national leader, and a role model, for many other communities to
       follow, both small and large, in part due to Envision Utah. Beyond
       that, though, the premises of the article are far off base.

       I would note, however, that their hours of service are not
       particularly good. The light rail and buses stop running at 7 pm
       sunday- even the light rail to the airport!
     * Bolwerk
       It's interesting. Usually you have to go to Germany or elsewhere in
       Europe to find demonstrations of the fact that rail is a very
       economical mode even for medium-small cities.
     * Devan
       Utah has 300 miles of light rail? Where did you get that figure
       from? The Utah TRAX light rail system is only 45 miles in length
       not 300. I don't see what's so special about that. Living within 3
       miles of a light rail stop is nothing to brag about either. Even if
       you're just one mile from a stop still makes it too far away to be
       of any practical use for you.
     * Angie Schmitt
       "added 300 miles of light rail to the plan" It's from a
       presentation by Grow and Allsop.
     * Ex-driver
       I suspect the success of Envision Utah has much to do with the
       unusual (for the U.S.) homogeneity of the population in the Salt
       Lake City region, not to mention the influence of a shared
       religion. This probably made it a lot easier for everyone to get
       behind a common vision than in the more socially fragmented cities
       and states in which most of us live.
     * Guest
       Half the population doesn't drink.
     * http://betterinstitutions.blogspot.com/ Shane Phillips
       Well most people out on the streets downtown aren't drinking, and
       even if all of them were, I'd expect half as many people. There is
       basically NO ONE out after 6, and clearly there's not much demand
       for it at this point since many businesses are closed. I suspect a
       big part of the explanation is the lack of housing in downtown.
     * DANL
       Topography, lighter development and the city's
       unusually(mistakenly) large city blocks facilitate new
       transportation infrastructures more easily & cheaply than other
       traditional cities.

       "The Envision Utah effort began shortly after the first light rail
       track was laid in the city, which had been controversial. But
       polling showed 88 percent of residents favored expanding the
       system."
       My crystal ball says that people will soon be writing this exact
       same sort of thing about bike share in New York.
     * Max Power
       After all of this investment, what was the change in mode share for
       transit?
     * Guest
       Equally important are the nasty smog-trapping inversions that hit
       in the winter months. Air quality is routinely horrid throughout
       the metropolitan area. It's easier to get people (even
       conservatives) on board with transit when you can point to the
       thick, brown air, increased incidents of respiratory illness, and
       <.5 mile visibility and say, "that's what happens when driving is
       everyone's only option"
     * David Parker
       I'm not sure how you think Salt Lake City is "the only city"
       building light rail, commuter rail, bus rapid transit and street
       car systems. Did you check Seattle? The RapidRide buses are
       expanding, the Sounder commuter rail is adding more trains after a
       new extension to the south line, The third street car line is under
       construction, and the light rail north subway is under
       construction. Check it out!
     * BBB
       I live in sandy,
       And I can say the light rail is ok, but the bus system sucks. No
       buses on the weekends, Last bus is at 7.30pm and they have an 1
       hour frequency.
       Keep in mind at 2.50 its also expensive.
       They keep claiming its so great. I don't see it. It car centric
       hell
     * NYFM
       add to all this the fact that SLC is experiencing smog and temp
       inversions as does any large metro in a basin and you have another
       major incentive for the populace to embrace mass transit.

       It's interesting how it doesn't mention how the Utah Transit
       Authority CEO makes 3 times what the Utah governor makes, and
       nearly as much as the President of the United States.
       That money is coming straight from taxpayers into his pocket. UTA
       spends more, and not in a responsible way. They also don't mention
       that their bus fares are constantly going up. It used to cost .25
       to ride the bus, and that was only 15 years ago. Sure it was on an
       older bus, but it went everywhere I needed it to go, and I was
       never stranded, so I could care less about whether or not the bus
       was new or not. Now the fare is $2.50! That's right, the rate has
       gone up by 10 times!
       The article also doesn't mention that their new Frontrunner
       commuter train does NOT run on Sundays. Their buses and light rail
       still do, so this makes NO sense.
       UTA needs a complete overhaul of their administration, and lowering
       of salaries and compensation across the board!
       I don't even bother with them anymore, because they are so corrupt.
       I wish I could stop feeding the beast by not paying them with tax
       money. What a crock they are.

       UTA should really be called UCTA - Utah Commuter Transit Authority.
       They're only interested in carrying people to work between 7 and 9
       a.m., and home again between 4 and 6 p.m. I live 4 miles from the
       University of Utah, but my closest bus, half a mile away, only runs
       once an hour and the round-trip fare is $5. It's much cheaper to
       buy a parking pass and drive to my class twice a week. The zoo
       doesn't have bus service. Airport service only runs during daytime
       hours, so don't plan on using it for a red-eye flight. Until UTA
       stops building and starts concentrating on service, it's pretty
       much unusable unless you're going a long distance and staying for 8
       hours or so.

       This is a third-World logic: build a system as cheap as possible,
       no matter how much safety, comfort or else is damaged. It is a
       logic that appeals to the lowest income groups of a city, but if
       transit is to be transportation more than a social program for the
       extreme poor, it shouldn't abide by that logic.
     * Anonymous
       I like the new TOD planned community of Daybreak
       ([30]http://www.daybreakutah.com/), which sits at the end of one of
       the new light rail extensions. It is an example of how you can
       plan, promote the benefits and market TOD without resorting to the
       usual heavily partisan discourse that accompanies such projects.
     * David Proffitt
       If you are a student at the University of Utah, the fees you pay
       every semester entitle you to a free transit pass you can use to
       ride any UTA service, including buses, TRAX (light rail), and
       commuter rail (FrontRunner). All these modes will carry bicycles,
       too. A bicycle will eat up that half mile in about 2 minutes!
       All in all, the buses work incredibly well in SLC, especially to
       get to the U.
     * Bliss
       While it's great to hear about SLC's progress, but the claim that
       it's the only city building light rail, brt, commuter rail, and
       streetcars is not true. Los Angeles has been (and is continuing) to
       do so as well, and has built a larger system. plus heavy rail /
       subway.
       True, it's a larger metro area but the claims about SLC being the
       only and/or building the most are false. That said, other cities
       should still emulate their great behavior!

     "Considering the utter neglect the NPS shows to the maintenance,

     course, ensuring motorists can still race along Rock Creek Parkway
