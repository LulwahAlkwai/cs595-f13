   Stupid or Terrifying? US agencies mounted 231 cyber-attack operations,
   we'd classify as act of war.
   At some point you have to wonder if the folks running the government
   are nuts, well I'm guessing many of us stopped wondering long ago. But
   the details of these attacks which apparently include US funded botnets
   to broadly penetrate networks and PCs internationally is chilling. You
   announce that were some foreign country to do something to you it
   should result in a military response and then you pretty much do the
   same thing to, well, everyone. I get that few countries individually
   would have the balls to attack the US even if they considered our
   actions an act of war, but countries do team up from time to time and,
   at the very least, it would make allies, for us, somewhat difficult to
   come by. Full article in the Washington Post this week:
