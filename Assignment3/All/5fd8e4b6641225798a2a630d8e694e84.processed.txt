Publishers Against the Dissemination of Research

   January 9, 2012 By [23]Annoyed Librarian

   I have to say I was as surprised and annoyed as other librarians when I
   [24]read [25]about the [26]Research Works Act, which seems to have
   shocked and surprised everyone in the academic community except the
   people who actually produce academic research.

   For those who missed the furor last week over a bill that was referred
   to a House Committee in mid-December, the Research Works Act is
   intended "To ensure the continued publication and integrity of
   peer-reviewed research works by the private sector."

   To do that, it would prohibit federal agencies from insisting on open
   access copies of articles reporting the results of research that has
   been funded by those agencies, policies like the one the NIH mandated
   in 2008.

   The Association of American Publishers is [27]ecstatic about the bill,
   and one detects the fingerprints of their lobbyists all over it. Here's
   the statement that seems to offend librarians the most:

     The Research Works Act will prohibit federal agencies from
     unauthorized free public dissemination of journal articles that
     report on research which, to some degree, has been federally-funded
     but is produced and published by private sector publishers receiving
     no such funding. It would also prevent non-government authors from
     being required to agree to such free distribution of these works.

   As any idiot could,and some very bright people have, pointed out, no
   private sector publishers have produced any research. On the other
   hand, this is the same group that [28]claims:

     the NIH policy deprives both authors and publishers of their free
     choice to use the business model best suited for disseminating
     content and could ultimately reduce incentives to make substantial
     investments in peer reviewing, publishing, and disseminating
     scientific research.

   We might also point out that the only substantial investments
   publishers make in peer reviewing involve sending the articles to
   researchers, who both produce the research and peer review it without
   being paid by the publishers. We wouldn't want to limit their free
   choice, though!

   The same ridiculous anti-open access statement by the AAP includes this
   doozy:

     The National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy seeks to address a
     challenge or problem that has not been proven to exist. In doing so,
     the NIH policy introduces legal conflicts with an author's and
     publisher's copyright and undermines intellectual property rights
     and the economic incentive of publishers and rights holders. The
     policy makes their copyrighted material available without
     compensation in online sites, for dissemination to anyone, anywhere,
     anytime. Such mandatory open access erodes and disrupts the proven,
     balanced economic model that supports and sustains journals as
     dynamic and effective vehicles for promoting scientific
     communication for centuries.

   Hmm, let's see. "A problem that has not been proven to exist." I guess
   commercial journal publishers raising subscription rates at 2-3 times
   the inflation rate, making it difficult to impossible for academic
   libraries to purchase the results of the research their universities
   pay for while publishers rake in hefty profits isn't a problem, at
   least not for the publishers!

   My favorite howler is the claim that "mandatory open access erodes and
   disrupts the proven, balanced economic model" for scholarly publishing.
   If the goal of scholarly research is strictly for publishers to profit,
   the model is proven and balanced. If the goal is to disseminate the
   results of scholarly research, the model is flawed and unsustainable.
   If it were proven and balanced, then the OA movement would never have
   started in the first place.

   Not that I would expect members of Congress to know that. Among those
   members are people who believe that global warming is a hoax or that
   spending more money on schools means always learn more. Interpreting
   evidence isn't really their strong suit. Accepting money from
   publishers is.

   As I said, I was a bit shocked. It's one thing when publishers of
   trashy best-selling novels try to keep public libraries out of the
   dissemination loop, but for publishers of scholarly research to do
   their best to thwart the dissemination of that research is a gross
   violation of the trust of all the researchers who provide them their
   content and quality control for free.

   Not that the researchers care, of course. If they cared, they would
   have stopped contributing to, reviewing for, and serving on the
   editorial boards of the worst offending journals years ago. They
   haven't, and won't, even if this particularly nauseous bill doesn't
   pass.

   Oh, sure, there will be a few professors protesting about anti-OA
   shenanigans, but the bulk of the scientists who publish in the
   commercial journals will continue to do so, and in this hunt the
   scientists have the big dogs. Or maybe they are the big dogs. It's
   whichever one of those that means the scientists have the most
   collective power.

   As with public libraries and their Big Six publishers, academic
   libraries have no control over the process. They sit idly by chattering
   about the problem while the powers that be worry about other things,
   like tenure and research grants.

       Decisions and trends like this don't bode well for the library as
       publisher model, either, which I think is an exciting direction
       that libraries could take in the future following the model of
       Douglas County Libraries in Colorado.

       The funniest part is they act like the researchers/writers get paid
       for any of this. Whether an article is in a paid or free journal,
       those who write the articles don't get paid. They don't get paid to
       write, they don't get paid to review, and, in most cases, they're
       paying a hefty fee to either subscribe to the journal, or be a
       member of the professional association who publishes it.
       I do feel, however, that the Annoyed Librarian misses an important
       point in this argument: faculty (or research staff) cannot just not
       publish their research. Some institutions are rather opposed to
       open access journals, and some view certain journals with differing
       levels of respect. Thus already tenured faculty may be able to pick
       and choose where they publish, but those still seeking tenure may
       have fewer options, at least if they want to get tenure.

            You forgot to mention that, in many cases, they pay to get the
            article published.

       ack! I have not seen this legislation! Gonna check it out though
       and contact my congress folk.

       See:
       "Research Works Act H.R.3699:
       The Private Publishing Tail Trying To Wag The Public Research Dog,
       Yet Again"
       [44]http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/867-guid.html
       EXCERPT:
       The US Research Works Act (H.R.3699): "No Federal agency may adopt,
       implement, maintain, continue, or otherwise engage in any policy,
       program, or other activity that -- (1) causes, permits, or
       authorizes network dissemination of any private-sector research
       work without the prior consent of the publisher of such work; or
       (2) requires that any actual or prospective author, or the employer
       of such an actual or prospective author, assent to network
       dissemination of a private-sector research work."
       Translation and Comments:
       "If public tax money is used to fund research, that research
       becomes "private research" once a publisher "adds value" to it by
       managing the peer review."
       [Comment: Researchers do the peer review for the publisher for
       free, just as researchers give their papers to the publisher for
       free, together with the exclusive right to sell subscriptions to
       it, on-paper and online, seeking and receiving no fee or royalty in
       return].
       "Since that public research has thereby been transformed into
       "private research," and the publisher's property, the government
       that funded it with public tax money should not be allowed to
       require the funded author to make it accessible for free online for
       those users who cannot afford subscription access."
       [Comment: The author's sole purpose in doing and publishing the
       research, without seeking any fee or royalties, is so that all
       potential users can access, use and build upon it, in further
       research and applications, to the benefit of the public that funded
       it; this is also the sole purpose for which public tax money is
       used to fund research.]"
       H.R. 3699 misunderstands the secondary, service role that
       peer-reviewed research journal publishing plays in US research and
       development and its (public) funding.
       It is a huge miscalculation to weigh the potential gains or losses
       from providing or not providing open access to publicly funded
       research in terms of gains or losses to the publishing industry:
       Lost or delayed research progress mean losses to the growth and
       productivity of both basic research and the vast R&D industry in
       all fields, and hence losses to the US economy as a whole.
       What needs to be done about public access to peer-reviewed
       scholarly publications resulting from federally funded research?
       The minimum policy is for all US federal funders to mandate
       (require), as a condition for receiving public funding for
       research, that: (i) the fundee's revised, accepted refereed final
       draft of (ii) all refereed journal articles resulting from the
       funded research must be (iii) deposited immediately upon acceptance
       for publication (iv) in the fundee''s institutional repository,
       with (v) access to the deposit made free for all (OA) immediately
       (no OA embargo) wherever possible (over 60% of journals already
       endorse immediate gratis OA self-archiving), and at the latest
       after a 6-month embargo on OA.
       It is the above policy that H.R.3699 is attempting to make
       illegal...

       There are so many sneaky, Orwellian bills being pushed through
       Congress these days, that it's hard to keep up with them.

       [48]January 10, 2012 at 4:23 pm
       I have just contacted the Representative for my area and Senators
       to vote against form of this bill. For shame.
    7. Mark says:
       [49]January 13, 2012 at 11:56 am
       Coordinating the flow of a few emails seems like insufficient cause
       to allow publishers to convert public property for private gain. If
       the public paid for the knowledge then the public own it!
    8. At the bench says:
       [50]January 22, 2012 at 4:43 pm
       Maybe scientists reviewing for Elsevier should start writing up
       contracts for peer review that reflect the value of their time and
       expertise: $500 per manuscript reviewed, with $250 up front and the
       rest due within 30 days of their sending the review to the
       publisher sounds about right. It's a mystery why they donate their
       services to profitable corporations.
