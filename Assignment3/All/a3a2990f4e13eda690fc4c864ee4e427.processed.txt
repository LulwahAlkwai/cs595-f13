            Semantic Web Challenge 2013 - Call for Participation

    Submissions are now invited for the 11th Semantic Web Challenge, the
    premier event for demonstrating practical progress towards achieving
    the vision of the Semantic Web. The 11th Semantic Web Challenge will
     take place at the [7]12th International Semantic Web Conference in
                             Sydney, Australia.

    The Semantic Web Challenge will consist of two tracks: the Open Track
    and the Big Data Track. The key difference between the two tracks is
      that the Big Data Track requires the participants to make use of
     large-scale data sets. The Open Track has no such restrictions. The
    Challenge is open to everyone from industry and academia. The authors
        of the best applications will be awarded prizes and featured
           prominently at special sessions during the conference.

                               Important Dates

     * Friday, September 20, 2013, 23:59 CET: Submissions due
     * October 23-25, 2013: Semantic Web Challenge takes place at ISWC
       2013

   Please note that you need a visa to enter Australia. You can find more
   information about [8]the visa process on the ISWC website. You may have
    to apply for a visa before the SWC deadline! We unfortunately cannot
                     assist with late visa applications.

                             Challenge Criteria

        The Challenge is defined in terms of minimum requirements and
     additional desirable features that submissions should exhibit. The
      criteria for the Semantic Web Challenge 2013 are described on the
                              [9]Criteria page.

                             How to Participate

                 The following information must be provided:
    1. Abstract: no more than 200 words.
    2. Description: The description should show details of the system,
       including why the system is innovative, which features or functions
       the system provides, what design choices were made and what lessons
       were learned. The description must include an appendix of 1-2 pages
       summarising explicitly how participants have addressed the
       evaluation requirements (including mandatory and any relevant
       desirable criteria). Papers should not exceed eight pages
       (including the appendix) and must be formatted according to the
       same guidelines as the papers in the Research Track (see
       [10]http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/).
    3. Web access: The application should be accessible via the web. If
       the application is not publicly accessible, passwords should be
       provided. A (short) set of instructions on how to start and use the
       application should also be provided on the web page.

    Please submit the description of your system (including the appendix)
                             via [11]EasyChair.

   Descriptions (including the appendix) will be published in the form of
          online proceedings on the Semantic Web Challenge website.

                             Judging and Prizes

    In addition to submitting a system description and working demo, all
    participants are required to present their systems at the posters and
   demos session at the ISWC conference. A jury consisting of experts from
     industry and academia will be appointed to judge the systems at the
     conference. In the first round of judging, the jury will take into
     consideration the descriptions submitted, the online demos, and the
   presentation at the conference, in order to determine an initial set of
   up to eight finalists. The entries will be scored by the judges and the
   eight highest scoring entries will then proceed to the second round of
    the competition. The split between the two tracks will be determined
            according to the proportion of entries in each track.

         The eight finalists will proceed to the second round of the
     competition, where they will have to present their work in an open
    session the following day. They will have a slot of approximately 15
     minutes to present their work. The judges will be present and will
       evaluate the systems in more detail, according to the specific
     [12]criteria detailed on the website. The judges will then meet in
        private to discuss the entries and to determine the winners.

    A monetary prize will be provided to the winners of each track, along
   with publicity for their work. There will normally be three winners of
      the Open Track and one winner of the Big Data track. However, the
      organisers reserve the right to merge the tracks in the event of
      insufficient submissions in either category. The winners will be
    announced and prizes awarded during the Closing Ceremony of ISWC. The
   winners also have the chance to submit their work to a Special Issue of
                        the Journal of Web Semantics.

   In the event that one of the tracks receive less than a minimal number
      of submissions, the organizers reserve the right to merge the two
                         tracks of the competition.
