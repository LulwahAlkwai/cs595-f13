   Australia's top domain-names company, Melbourne IT, was thrust into the
   latest development of the Syrian civil war when pro-Damascus hackers,
   aided by people in India, penetrated its security systems and disrupted
   access to The New York Times website and Twitter.

   As one analyst warned the ASX-listed company faced a "global feeding
   frenzy" over the security breach, Melbourne IT chief executive Theo
   Hnarakis denied it was responsible.

   "This is something that could happen to any company and any staff
   member," said Mr Hnarakis, who announced on Tuesday he would step down
   after 11 years as CEO.

   "This is not a breakdown of security, this is not a weakness of our
   systems where someone's been able to hack in and grab customer
   information or credit card information."

   In an attack The New York Times Co equated to "breaking into Fort
   Knox", hackers changed the records of nine separate websites from about
   5am AEST on Wednesday.

   The records ensure visitors who type "nyt.com" end up at The New York
   Times website, and the hacks meant visitors were redirected to a
   different website, or were not able to reach those sites at all for
   several hours.

   The incursion was traced to India-based perpetrators who fooled staff
   at a US-based reseller of Melbourne IT services into handing over
   personal details and, as a result, the login and passwords which
   allowed someone to access and change key details for the websites, Mr
   Hnarakis said.

   The reseller is likely to be Corporation Services Company, which
   purchased Melbourne IT's digital marketing division and, along with it,
   contracts for The New York Times and Twitter website records for
   $152.5 million in March.

   Dangerous for companies

   Melbourne IT was made aware of the attacks at 6am AEST on Wednesday.
   "This could happen to anyone, it just happens to be our turn," Mr
   Hnarakis said.

   James Turner, an analyst at technology research firm IBRS, said being
   at the centre of a hacking scandal was dangerous for companies and he
   pointed to the liquidation of previously successful web-hosting company
   Distribute.IT after it was hit by a malicious hacker in 2011.

   "Melbourne IT is now in danger from a global feeding frenzy that could
   start with security experts coming out of the woodwork to decry them
   for not putting enough defences in place," he said. "But I really think
   that misses the mark; they were attacked by malicious entity and we
   should focus on that."

   The attack left visitors unable to visit The New York Times website for
   several hours. It also affected several country-specific Twitter
   websites and Twitter's online image-hosting service, Twimg.

   Other websites targeted are believed to include the Huffington Post's
   UK site, which had additional security measures in place to prevent
   similar changes.

   The affected email addresses and login details have since been blocked
   from accessing those records.

   The Syrian Electronic Army, a collective of hackers which openly
   supports the Syrian government, claimed credit but did not make clear
   its motives.

   The Syrian government is under threat of a military strike from the US
   and others after allegedly launching chemical weapons killing hundreds
   last week.

   Any immediate damage from the hacking attack to Melbourne IT was not
   apparent on Wednesday, when its shares fell 1¢ to $1.63. Stockbroking
   analysts contacted declined to comment publicly until more details
   about the gravity of the hacks became clear.

   Second hacking event

   One said any adverse investor reaction would be led by whether a
   significant outcry erupted and dealt a heavy blow to the company's
   reputation.

   It is the second time in as many years the company has been implicated
   in a security failure. It was similarly at the centre of hacking
   attempts last year, which saw the details of thousands of AAPT
   customers stolen.

   Mr Turner, the IBRS analyst, said web companies such as Melbourne IT
   could be expected to have the highest levels of security in place, but
   there was no such thing as a 100 per cent secure defence against
   attacks that were perpetrated by hackers tricking people.

   "We know that the Australian market has a high degree of intolerance
   about these things, but in many ways this isn't actually Melbourne IT's
   fault ... they have been attacked by a group of hackers and they
   shouldn't be punished by retribution coming from the marketplace," he
   said."It appears these types of attacks will continue, so long as the
   `supply chain' security remains weak for these firms," he said.

   "There will be a lot of people out there saying they should have done
   more and that this is unforgivable, but this is also the reality of
   doing business now and you can't protect yourself from everything," he
   said.

   Security experts warned that similar, future attacks were likely
   against mainstream news publications.

   The New York Times Co's chief information officer, Marc Frons, told the
   newspaper that the outage was "the result of a malicious external
   attack" equivalent to "breaking into Fort Knox".

   "A domain registrar should have extremely tight security because they
   are holding the security to hundreds if not thousands of websites," he
   said.

   CEO had announced departure

   It is the latest in a line of attacks for the pro-Syrian Government
   group. It has previously attacked the websites Financial Times and The
   Washington Post, causing outages or website redirections for some
   articles.

   In April, [5]it famously took control of the Twitter account of
   Associated Press, falsely reporting a bomb explosion at the White House
   that wiped $US136.5 billion off US equity markets in three minutes.

   The Syrian Electronic Army reported on Twitter shortly after the
   attacks that its own website was taken down by its website domain host
   due to a breach of agreement.

   Mr Hnarakis, who [6]announced his departure from company a day before
   the attacks after 11 years as CEO, said it was one of the most serious
   and high-profile attacks he had seen.

   "Obviously it's a concern and as these sites become more and more
   critical to organisations, the higher profile these attacks," he said.
   "But this is not isolated."
   [7d380f54-0fd9-11e3-ab1d-b9f686903bd2_29p03hack.png]

   A former security reporter with The Washington Post, Brian Krebs, said
   that although the attack was simple, it was not common to gain access
   to the records of multiple websites at once.

   "It's the simplest way of defacing a site to which you cannot write,"
   he said. "If you can't arbitrarily post content on The New York Times'
   website, that's not a big deal if you control their DNS records; you
   can simply redirect visitors to nytimes.com to a site that you control,
   and then you can serve them with whatever message or content you like.

   "It only takes one [website host] to have a security weakness for
   persistent attackers like the SEA to find a way in."

   [7]Security researcher HD Moore told technology blog Mashable that
   other domains including those belonging to AOL, Yahoo!, Google and
   Microsoft were also hosted with Melbourne IT and could also be under
   threat if the attackers had discovered a weakness in the company's
   systems.

   FireEye manager of threat intelligence Darien Kindlund said the group
   had specifically focused on attacking the weakest in a chain of
   suppliers behind mainstream news websites.

   "Rather than attacking a large firm directly, SEA is opting to identify
   weaker links between the firm and other partnering organisations that
   they use for business operations," he said. "This is because the victim
   firm may not have as much control over the operational security
   employed by the partners, so the partners are an easier target to focus
   on."

   He said blame likely laid with all three parties involved - Melbourne
   IT, the US reseller and the website owner - due to a failure of
   security at different levels.
