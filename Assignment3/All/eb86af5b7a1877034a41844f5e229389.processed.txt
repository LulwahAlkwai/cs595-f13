road fatalities usa

   Use this site to view information about virtually every fatality that
   occurred on roads in the United States as a result of a collision
   involving a motor vehicle between between 1 January 2001 and 31
   December 2009. For each incident you will be able to see the person's
   age, sex and the year in which the crash took place. Where information
   is not available fields are left blank.

   To start enter a place name into the search box, press return and then
   select the correct result from the results list. If the place is not
   listed then try a larger place nearby.

   When you are in the right area of the country use the mouse and the
   zoom buttons to move around the map. Use the 'bigger/smaller' icon in
   the top-right corner of the map to make the map larger or smaller. Use
   the 'key' button in the top-left corner to open or close the key for
   the map.
