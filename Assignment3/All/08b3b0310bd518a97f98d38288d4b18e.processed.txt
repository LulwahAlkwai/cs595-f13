Are Women Better Leaders than Men?

   by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman  |   10:14 AM March 15, 2012

   We've all heard the claims, the theories, and the speculation about the
   ways leadership styles vary between women and men. [48]Our latest
   survey data puts some hard numbers into the mix.

   Our data come from 360 evaluations, so what they are tracking is the
   judgment of a leader's peers, bosses, and direct reports. We ask these
   individuals to rate each leader's effectiveness overall and also to
   judge how strong he or she is on the 16 competencies that our 30 years
   of research shows are most important to overall leadership
   effectiveness. We ask, for instance, how good a leader is at taking the
   initiative, developing others, inspiring and motivating, and pursuing
   their own development.

   Our latest survey of 7,280 leaders, which our organization evaluated in
   2011, confirms some seemingly eternal truths about men and women
   leaders in the workplace but also holds some surprises. Our dataset was
   generated from leaders in some of the most successful and progressive
   organizations in the world both public and private, government and
   commercial, domestic and international.

   In the confirmation category is our first finding: The majority of
   leaders (64%) are still men. And the higher the level, the more men
   there are: In this group, 78% of top managers were men, 67% at the next
   level down (that is, senior executives reporting directly to the top
   managers), 60% at the manager level below that.

   Similarly, most stereotypes would have us believe that female leaders
   excel at "nurturing" competencies such as developing others and
   building relationships, and many might put exhibiting integrity and
   engaging in self-development in that category as well. And in all four
   cases our data concurred -- women did score higher than men.

   But the women's advantages were not at all confined to traditionally
   women's strengths. In fact at every level, more women were rated by
   their peers, their bosses, their direct reports, and their other
   associates as better overall leaders than their male counterparts --
   and the higher the level, the wider that gap grows (see chart; click on
   the image to view a larger chart):

   [49]Overall-Leadership-Effectiveness-by-Gender-by-Position.jpg
   Specifically, at all levels, women are rated higher in fully 12 of the
   16 competencies that go into outstanding leadership. And two of the
   traits where women outscored men to the highest degree -- taking
   initiative and driving for results -- have long been thought of as
   particularly male strengths. As it happened, men outscored women
   significantly on only one management competence in this survey -- the
   ability to develop a strategic perspective (see chart; click on the
   image to view a larger chart).
   [50]The-Top-16-Competencies-Top-Leaders-Exemplify-Most.jpg
   So what should we conclude from these data? Why are we not engaging and
   fully employing these exemplary women leaders? Yes, blatant
   discrimination is a potential explanation. If not actual than certainly
   perceptual. When we shared our findings with a group of women outside
   this particular survey and asked them to suggest why they thought their
   colleagues had been rated so highly on taking initiative and
   self-development, their answers pointed to the still-tenuous position
   they feel themselves to be in the workplace:

   "We need to work harder than men to prove ourselves."

   "We feel the constant pressure to never make a mistake, and to
   continually prove our value to the organization."

   That is, anecdotally, at least, the women we queried don't feel their
   appointments are safe. They're afraid to rest on their laurels. Feeling
   the need (often keenly) to take initiative, they are more highly
   motivated to take feedback to heart.

   The irony is that these are fundamental behaviors that drive the
   success of every leader, whether woman or man.

   Why are women viewed as less strategic? This is an easier question to
   answer.Top leaders always score significantly higher in this
   competency; since more top leaders are men, men still score higher here
   in the aggregate. But when we measure only men and women in top
   management on strategic perspective, their relative scores are the
   same.

   What should leaders and managers do with these findings? Here are our
   thoughts. Feel free to respond as well with your own.
     * As leaders in organizations look hard to find the talent they need
       to achieve exceptional results, they ought to be aware that many
       women have impressive leadership skills. Our research shows these
       leadership skills are strongly correlated to organizational success
       factors such as retaining talent, customer satisfaction, employee
       engagement, and profitability.
     * As to the constant state of unease we hear women leaders express --
       clearly, chauvinism or discrimination is an enigma that
       organizations (and the business culture) should work hard to
       prevent. However, that said, think of the benefits every leader in
       every organization would gain from a mind-set that they simply
       can't afford to make a mistake. Paranoia or extreme risk aversion
       is clearly detrimental to a rising career. But in today's economic
       climate, every leader, male or female, would do well to avoid
       becoming complacent.
