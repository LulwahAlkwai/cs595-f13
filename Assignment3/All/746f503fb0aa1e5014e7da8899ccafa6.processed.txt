[22]The awesome vocal booth you already own

   Sunday, July 28th, 2013 | by [23]matthew mcglynn

   Your microphone doesn't only hear your voice. It also hears your room.

   Few things annoy me more, when listening to a podcast, voiceover, or
   vocal track, than a crappy-sounding room. You can't fix a lousy room
   sound in the mix! That's why professional studios usually have a vocal
   booth or isolation booth of some sort. It's a room that is lined with
   sound-absorbing materials. A vocal booth could be anything from a
   closet lined with packing blankets to [24]an engineered space that acts
   like a sonic black hole.

   Low-cost methods can work. But, needless to say, you need a space
   first. Sometimes circumstances just don't allow for a booth.

   Or do they? I wonder if you've overlooked an excellent vocal booth that
   you already own?

Audio Test - The Mystery Vocal Booth

   I recorded a quick voice track using an inexpensive condenser, the
   [25]Studio Projects LSM Studio Projects LSM. Although the LSM has a
   16-bit USB output, I used its analog output and a Mackie Onyx Blackjack
   24-bit USB interface.

   The first track below was recorded in my studio room, which is fairly
   well treated with RealTraps and Auralex absorption products. It doesn't
   sound bad at all; in fact, all the podcasts I've guested on were
   recorded right here, as well as all my podcast mic shootouts [the
   [26]Ultimate Podcasting Mic Shootout of broadcast dynamics, the
   [27]$200 Condensers shootout, and the [28]USB Dynamics shootout].

    [29]Voice track, treated room

   ... but then, this track does benefit from ~$2500 worth of acoustic
   treatment. It ought to sound pretty good. If you heard that track by
   itself, you might not notice the sound of the room at all.

   Well, until you hear the same voice, the same mic, and the same
   interface, recorded inside my mystery vocal booth. Check out how dry
   and direct this sounds:

    [30]Voice track, mystery booth

   This track is so much more present, more detailed, and more clear! It
   sounds louder, but it's not; all the tracks on this page were RMS
   gain-matched.

   Maybe you don't need so much control over your room sound, but if ever
   you do, I'll show you how to get it.

   But first, I'm going to be a bit unfair.

Audio Torture Test - The Flutter Echo Room

   Let's pretend your recording space is not well treated. (Judging from
   some of the voiceovers and podcasts I've heard, too many are not!)

   I recorded a track in the worst-sounding room in my house. It's a
   16'x14' space with a hard floor, a giant window, and apparently not
   enough furnishings to tame its reverb. It suffers from [31]gruesome
   flutter echo (click that link to hear flutter echo slowed down to
   half-speed, which is the sonic equivalent of watching someone get
   knifed in slow motion).

    [32]Voice track, echo room

   I can hear the sound of the space clearly through monitors, but for
   best effect, listen through headphones. Then compare it to the two
   previous tracks. This illustrates the value of a dead space (or, at
   least, a controlled space) clearly.

Your Mystery Vocal Booth, Revealed

   It is a small space, lined approximately 60% with sound-absorbent foam
   and fabric. It has no parallel surfaces that could set up standing
   waves. And it is shockmounted from the floor, to prevent capture of
   mechanical vibrations.

   Is that description not ringing any bells? I'll give you the final
   clue: it's parked in your driveway.

   Yes, I'm talking about your car. Hardtop and cloth seats preferred, and
   a garage too. It probably sounds better than your room does.

Convenience & Alternatives

   Recording in your car is not always convenient, I admit. You probably
   can't stand in there, and there's probably no room for instruments.
   There are a limited number of applications for which a vehicle makes a
   perfect isolation/vocal booth.

   But, when you need that degree of isolation and control, you have it.

   I would still recommend treating your room. This pays for itself in the
   quality of your recorded tracks, as well as the translation of your
   mixes. There's really no substitute for a great-sounding room.

   As an inexpensive first step toward treating your room, I'd recommend
   the [33]RealTraps Portable Vocal Booth. It puts a healthy dose of
   absorption immediately behind your vocal mic, giving you a significant
   improvement in control for a relatively low cost -- certainly much
   cheaper than treating the whole room.

   I also tend to recommend dynamic mics for most voice applications.
   Unless you have a trained voice, you'll probably get better results
   with a dynamic microphone. (If you're shopping, Audio-Technica has a
   crazy-inexpensive option in its [34]~$49 ATR2100-USB.)

It's dumb, but it works.

   Some of you are probably tempted to write comments to tell me what a
   remarkably stupid idea it is to suggest recording voice tracks in a
   car.

   But you can't deny the effect.

   If you take just one thing away from this article, let it be this:
   Listen to your room. And then fix it.

       Although I agree on your recordings, I do not have a similar
       results.
       I have a small car and its quite the opposite. Its by no means as
       reverberant as some rooms but it is very boxy and rather horrible
       sounding. It sounds as if I'm trapped in a closet, you know its
       dampened by the clothes (or carseats/carpet) but there is still a
       sense of "small roomy" sound.
       If I need a quick DIY booth I go for the much more cooler "building
       a fort out of bedsheets and pillows" method.
       P.S. My garage is solid concrete all over...

       @christopher, kudos to you for trying it, and for listening!
       The last time I built a fort out of bedsheets was a disaster. I was
       on the road, with no mic stands. I ended up squatting next to the
       bed, holding the comforter over my head with one arm and the mic
       with another. It sounded OK, but I would have had an easier time in
       the car.

       I recommend recording in cars all the time when I am mixing a movie
       that needs an ADR line, especially off-camera. I simply ask the
       actor to record a handful of takes at different intensities with
       their iPhone, or a Zoom. The back seat usually is better because
       you avoid the front windshield reflections.
       Also - when I've helped friends with their podcasts, I notice most
       people use a desk stand, which puts the mic only a few inches above
       the table surface. This causes severe comb filtering right in the
       midrange frequencies. Simply raising the mic up with a taller
       stand, or putting a paint can under the mic stand works well. An
       alternative is to place a thick fabric, like bunched up fleece or a
       bunched up sweatshirt on the table in front of the mic. Even
       cutting two peaks from a 1-foot wide piece of Auralex and placing
       that on the table a few inches in front of the mic kills the comb
       filter causing reflections.
       Play around and see how much better things can sound!

       I've mused on the sonic benefits of the automobile many times
       myself. Not only in the regard you're speaking of, but also in
       terms of the ubiquitous "why does my voice always sound so much
       better when I'm signing in my car?" comment.
       Obviously there are lots of other mitigating circumstances to be
       considered (you're singing over someone else's vocal track, you're
       not singing into a dynamically-sensitive mic, your skull resonates
       pleasingly, etc) but there's no doubt that all of those sonic
       benefits that Matt mentioned are in play as well.
       And any engineer who's been at it a while will tell you that a
       properly-mixed album's not done until it "passes the car test."
       Ostensibly this is an exercise in how well your mix holds up in a
       less-than-ideal environment, but I would argue that it's a pretty
       great one. Road/engine noise and less-than ideal speaker choices
       (and car doors as speaker cabinets) make this statement far less
       than totally accurate, but it's still a really essential test of an
       album's polish.

       Awesome tests! I've been playing with a portable booth but find it
       difficult to use when recording a podcast because I need access to
       my screen / notes.
       I'm at the point though of creating a dedicated room because here
       in Sweden our houses are all wooden floors and massive glass
       windows. The room noise drives me crazy.
    6. [49]matthew mcglynn
       [50]July 30th, 2013 at 1:55 pm
       Jon, if a dedicated room is too big a stretch, you could drape
       heavy blankets over boom stands (with the arm at 90 degrees to the
       base), creating lightweight gobos, during recording.
       I can definitely hear the room in your voice tracks.
       It is good to see that you have some decent microphones to work
       with:
       [51]http://jontusmedia.com/which-microphone-should-i-use-for-podcas
       ting/
       As Adam Kagan suggested in a previous comment, reducing reflections
       in the immediate vicinity of the microphone could help, too. Make
       sure to angle the mic so that your computer screen is in the mic's
       null point.
       Note too that the PR40's null is _not_ at 180 degrees; that mic is
       essentially hypercardioid, with the deepest null at 135 degrees:

       I have used my walk-in closet packed on 3 walls with hanging
       clothes. It is more like an anechoic chamber than a treated room,
       but with careful use of a convolution reverb it does well.

       Somehow, I intuitively knew recording in the car would work out.
       Must have been all those car commercials about the quiet ride.
       Besides, it was either that, or a highly reflective room with wood
       floors, bare walls, and mic mounted on a wooden desk top.
       Bottom line. I hopped in the back seat of a late model Volkswagen
       Jetta, used the drop down arm rest, and spoke into the built-in
       mics of a Zoom H4n for the voice over that was due to my client
       overnight. -- Mission Accomplished.
       Sure, I know I what I used, and was equally shocked when the client
       LOVED the piece. (Of course, I did also use a music bed below it,
       but that was as requested).
       Great article. Thanks!

       Here is a new product I discovered that will solve many of your
       room problems easily and not cost a fortune. My room was the
       dreaded rectangle, four paralell walls and eight foot ceilings. Not
       only did I have flutter, the low end built up as well. I bought one
       package of these down sloping panels and turned my room into a nice
       smooth sounding space.
       I really didnt expect the low end to be tamed as well as it was.
       This is worth checking out. I got mine at just under $600.00 from a
       new
       dealer.

       Whenever I have to rig up a recording booth out of nothing I'll
       raise a few beds up vertically. Ideally four as to build a room
       within the room. It is then possible to lay a mattress on top and
       even underneath. Usually works quite well.
       Thanks for good article and all the useful tips in this thread!

       I produce a weekly radio program for public radio stations (NOT a
       podcast), usually recorded in a friend's dining room, or other
       random location since they lost their home and studio. We have
       settled on using earclip mics, such as the ones from
       microphonemadness.com or PylePro. Since they are located right by
       the mouth, they can sound very good.
       We also use a 10 band narrow notch filter (Waves Q10) to reduce
       room resonances with narrow filters around a Q of 100 and it cleans
       it up nicely!
       The ear mics allow far more flexibility and clarity, and the ones
       around $129 and even the $25 Pyles actually work very well.
       Another good tip is the Auralex type foam which can be glued to
       pegboard material from any hardware store and hung on small nails
       or mic stands wherever you need them.

       Brilliant... low tech and some common sense often win the war
       against evil audio conundrums! The industry would like to throw
       money at it, we don't all have that 5+ figure budget. It's most
       enjoyable when someone comes up with a basic and simple solution!
       Yes, choice of cars / interiors would be crucial. Wouldn't be hard
       to look through old road tests in Car and Driver or Road and Track
       to find those buggies that have the quietest interiors. Though you
       might be a redneck if you use vehicle seats for your sitting room,
       they do absorb a tremendous amount of audio with their thick foam
       and durable upholstery , may be a good addition to the studio,
       pretty comfortable too on long trips... could headliners be cut to
       make absorptive panels, you may have started something!
