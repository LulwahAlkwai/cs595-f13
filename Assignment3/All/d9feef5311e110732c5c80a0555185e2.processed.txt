[120]Biography Of A Blue Whale, Told Through Ear Wax

   by Ed Yong

   A few years ago, [121]Stephen Trumble contacted the Santa Barbara
   Museum of Natural History and asked if they had some earwax from a blue
   whale.

   They did.

   In 2007, a large ship travelling off the coast of California collided
   with a male blue whale, ending its life at the tender age of 12. It was
   one of three similar strikes that year. The animal's 21 metre carcass
   washed up on the beach, and scientists from the local museum examined
   and dissected it with machetes and excavators. They collected several
   tissues and organs, including a 25-centimetre tube of earwax.

   Earplugs are common to blues and other large whales like fins and
   humpbacks. They are similar to the ones in your ears, although
   obviously much bigger. Each is an oily build-up of wax and fats that
   accumulates through the whale's life. "It looks like a long candlestick
   that's been beat up a bit," says [123]Sascha Usenko, Trumble's
   colleague at Baylor University. "It's not appealing-looking."

   A whale produces a lighter-coloured wax during the time of year when
   it's feeding, and a dark-coloured version when it migrates. If you cut
   through the earplug, you can see these varieties as alternating light
   and dark bands. They're like tree rings. And just like tree rings, you
   can use them to estimate a whale's age. That's why scientists often
   collect and store the wax from dead whales.

   But Trumble and Usenko have shown that the wax can reveal much more. It
   also preserves a chemical biography of a whale's life, from its birth
   to its untimely ship-inflicted death. It records some of the hormones
   that surged through its body and the pollutants that it absorbed.

   The duo previously measured environmental contaminants in whale
   blubber, but they realised that the same chemicals also ought to build
   up in earwax, which is made of similar fatty substances. "It was really
   an `A-ha!' moment," says Usenko. To find fresh whale wax, they
   contacted Michelle Berman-Kowalewskic from the Santa Barbara Museum of
   Natural History, who handed over the earplug from the dead blue whale
   they had dissected in 2007.

   The plug showed that the whale's testosterone levels rose during its
   first three years of life, fell until it was nine, and then shot up by
   around 200 times. That's almost certainly the point when it became
   sexually mature. When other scientists have tried to work out this age
   using body length, ovaries or blubber, they've come up with estimates
   ranging from 5 to 15 years. "We didn't really know," says Udenko. "Now,
   we've nailed that down with tight resolution for one animal, and it'll
   be really exciting to do a bunch more."

   Meanwhile, the whale's levels of cortisol--a stress-related hormone--
   rose steadily over the course of its life and peaked a year after its
   testosterone spike. This might reflect the need to compete for mates,
   or to interact with other mature whales. "I think about what I was like
   at that age," says Udenko. "A raging bull, trying to figure out my
   place in the social order... I was pretty stressed out."

   In the earplug, the team also found traces of several contaminants.
   There were 16 pesticides, flame retardants and other pollutants that
   tend to persist in the environment for a long time, such as the
   long-banned insecticide DDT. These were most concentrated during the
   first six months of the whale's life, suggesting that they were
   inherited from its mother, either through the womb or from her milk.

   There was also a fair amount of mercury, which gradually accumulated
   over the whale's life and peaked twice, once when it was five years old
   and again when it was ten. Human industries like gold-mining can
   release large amounts of mercury into the oceans. Perhaps this whale
   was caught in a few such surges during its travels past California.

   The chemical contents of the whale's blubber matched those within its
   wax, which assured Trumble and Usenko that their readings were
   accurate. But blubber has no rings, so it can only give you an overall
   picture of the whales' life. Earwax can tell you what happened every
   six months. Blubber gives the sum of the whale's chemical bill; the
   earplug shows the individual lines.

   "I was surprised at how well [the technique] worked, not only for
   persistent chemicals but for hormones that typically rapidly degrade,"
   says Usenko. "It allows us to ask more complex questions that are
   difficult to get at, like: What are the impacts of contaminants or
   stress on these animals?"

   To get the same sorts of readings, Usenko says that he would need to
   follow a blue whale around for years, and take tissue sample from it
   every six months. "You couldn't do it," he says. "People have tried,
   but it's difficult and you have to be committed for 30 years. Here, we
   can go to a lab and reconstruct the same effort in a month."

   But the earplugs have several limitations, says [126]John Wise, a
   toxicologist at the University of Southern Maine who specialised on
   marine mammals. They only capture certain pollutants that accumulate in
   fat, they don't tell us how those pollutants affect the animal's
   health, and they can only be extracted from a dead whale.
   "Nevertheless, it's a new and useful part of our whale conservation
   toolbox as we seek to better understand ocean pollution," he says.

   And, of course, the team have only looked at one earplug from one
   whale. Usenko acknowledges this, and says the study is meant to be a
   proof-of-principle. "We want to encourage museums to keep and collect
   these samples," he says.

   Existing earplugs should already provide a trove of data. The
   Smithsonian Institute alone has hundreds of plugs in its collection,
   many of which have been traced back to specific whales. They're not in
   pristine condition, but they could be useful. Charles Potter, who
   manages the institute's marine mammal collection and is a co-author on
   the paper, is now thinking about how to preserve these waxy treasures.

   hormone profiles. PNAS [127]http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1311418110

   PS: In case anyone was wondering, it doesn't seem that the earplugs
   prevent the whales from hearing. In fact, some scientists have
   suggested that the plugs might actually help to channel sound towards
   the eardrum.

   And finally, this is a good chance to reprise my blue whale facts:
     * Blue whales are so big that each one can grow as large as a fully
       grown blue whale. That's huge!
     * If you take all the blue whales in the world and put them on a
       giant weighing scale, you are on drugs.
     * A blue whale's main artery is so big that a human could swim
       through it, but it's generally not advised.
     * A blue whale's heart is the size of a Volkswagen beetle, but its
       steering is rubbish.
     * If you take a blue whale's intestines and lay them in a line, the
       whale will die. Also, what's wrong with you, you sick bastard?

       Wonder what whales do when they get water stuck in their ears like
       human swimmers? Maybe that explains breaching? `I'll get that water
       out of my ear if it's the last thing I do!'
