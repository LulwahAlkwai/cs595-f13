   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   File Under Things That I'd Rather See Someone Else Do. Researcher shows
   how to trigger out of body experiences.
   Interesting story on how you can get someone to have an Out of Body
   Experience (OBE). Apparently all you have to do is confuse the senses
   and make the person's mind perceive an image or idem as part of, or all
   of, their own body. Once the perception shifts they will feel separate
   from their body as the filters that normally assure body/mind cohesion
   effectively fail. In a side, but I'm sure totally unrelated note, demon
   possessions are up this year. (Kidding on this last, I hope).
   Interesting, though somewhat freaky, story in Gizmag this week:
