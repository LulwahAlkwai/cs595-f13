XKCD has some amazing facts about oceans for you

   By [41]Jess Zimmerman

   Randall Munroe, writer of the web comic XKCD, has put out another one
   of his dizzyingly meticulous infographics, and this one is about the
   [42]depths of various bodies of water. No, wait, don't leave, it's
   actually really cool!

   Here's a teeny version, but you should click to look in more depth (ha)
   at the whole thing.

   Some of the cool facts contained therein:
     * The Edmund Fitzgerald, Kursk, and Lusitania all sank in water
       shallower than they were long.
     * Lake Erie clearly has an inferiority complex.
     * An emperor penguin can dive deeper than an Ohio-class nuclear sub.
     * Sperm whales dive crazy crazy deep. Like, the pressure down there
       is so great, it would push air back in to a ruptured scuba tank.
     * James Cameron's recent [43]deep-diving mission went further down in
       the ocean that the abyss of The Abyss.
