   The Next-Gen Tegra Note Tablet: A 2014 Tablet in 2013
   There are a number of fascinating things about the Tegra Note Tablet.
   One is how they took it to market which allowed them to bring a
   technology to market 6 or more months early so it could make the end of
   this year rather than mid next year. Another is the heavy focus on
   artistic creation and music which is unusual for a 7" tablet. NVIDIA
   moved the bar with this thing and still held to an attractive price
   point in the $200 range. I talk about this in my TGDaily column this
   week:
