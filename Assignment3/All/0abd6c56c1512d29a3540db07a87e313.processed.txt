[4]Where are the "big problem" jobs?

   Several authors, scientists and entrepreneurs have lamented our poor
   ability to innovate. It seems that industry is recruiting [5]few people
   to work on hard problems, except maybe when they are supported by the
   government:

     Private businesses seem remarkably uninterested in tackling serious
     problems such as energy despite soaring prices and evident problems.
     In the rare cases where someone may be attempting to solve these
     problems, one often finds the heavy hand of government funding, for
     better or worse.

   Many years ago, I pursued a Ph.D., not to become a professor or even a
   government researcher, but rather to pursue industrial R&D. I had vague
   dreams about working in some corporate research laboratory. I imagined
   I would be working on cool new technology to solve important problems.
   I never even questioned that such job existed... until I went looking
   for them!

   I was disappointed. Instead, I ended up starting my own business.
   Amazingly, it worked! We got several contracts to do leading-edge work
   that still determines my research agenda to this day. I acquired a
   taste for problems that matter. However, much of our funding (maybe
   40%) came indirectly from the government.

   "Where are the big problem jobs?" I would say that they are either
   supported by the government or, better yet, driven by
   entrepreneurship.^1

   The problem with government R&D is that it has a [6]bad track record at
   helping the economy, outside of a few areas such as agriculture. Baumol
   made a similar point in the [7]Free-Market Innovation Machine: Imperial
   China, the Roman Empire and even the USSR had great scholars and no
   shortage of technological innovation. However, they lacked the means to
   reap the benefits of this research. Government R&D often comes about as
   a mix of bureaucratic campuses, bureaucratic government laboratories
   and bureaucratic corporations. That's only exciting if you have a
   perverse sense of humor.

   Want to kill a good idea? Assign it to a committee.

   What Imperial China, the Roman Empire and the USSR lacked, was
   entrepreneurship. I conjecture that the number of science graduates who
   become entrepreneurs is a better predictor of economic progress than
   the number of new Ph.D.s. And if you are a young woman or man who wants
   to work on big problems, you would be better off preparing yourself for
   some form of entrepreneurship... if you want your work to matter.

   Too many scientists think that science is created in a laboratory and
   then turned into a product by puny engineers. The reverse process is at
   least as likely to happen. It is by trying to solve important problems
   that significant science comes about.

   Yet we are not used to think of scientists as entrepreneurs. We are not
   used of thinking of science as a process where you get money, hire
   people and make a profit. In some ways, the idea of patenting a new
   refrigerator seems contrary to science. Yet Einstein [8]held such a
   patent that he sold for profit.

   Our idea of the scientist has too much to do with the Mandarins of
   Imperial China and not enough to do with [9]Sergey Brin.

   ^1- There are corporate exceptions. For example, Google seems to be
   working on a few big problems, such as the self-driving car and Google
   Glass.

    1. lol puny engineers? try to make your arguments without resorting to
       inflammatory descriptors.

    2. @John Smith
       The engineers are not puny, but they are sometimes viewed as
       such... merely executing whatever researchers conceived. That is
       not my view.

    3. Right. But back to your original question. What jobs are there in
       solving big-problems?
       Why does private enterprise keep failing to deliver sustainable
       energy, agriculture or social justice?
       For all its faults, government is the only place that DOES do large
       scale investment in research that isn't immediately profitable. You
       can't get industrial research jobs in lots of areas of physics or
       biology. Let alone social science, history or philosophy.
       Right now, private space exploration is extremely trendy, but I'm
       willing to bet you that it won't ... ahem ... take-off. I suggest
       that private space exploration is more a function of the fact that
       the internet has created a few extremely wealthy and geeky
       philanthropists willing to spend their money, than that private
       enterprise can, in general, make a profit from space research.
       Government does it badly. Private enterprise doesn't do it at all.
       What do you suggest next?

    4. I agree that much of world-shaping research is going to fall on
       scientists-turned-entrepreneurs. Besides Google, a great example
       that we've already been seeing are the MOOCs that have been started
       by the Stanford faculty. But producing scientist-entrepreneurs is
       difficult for two important reasons: 1) Pursuing science and
       pursuing commercial products are conflicting goals. One is pursued
       for the benefits of knowledge alone and the other is for monetary
       gain. Mixing the two can lead to confusing interests. 2)
       Entreprenurship involves a lot of risk: everything from the
       financial aspects to the amount of time and effort put into
       building actual products from research results. I doubt very few
       young scientists would initially go this route, unless they are
       already tenured faculty, with little to lose.
       I think alot of this was discussed in a post by Matt Welsh on his
       blog:

    5. Silicon Valley was founded with government investment to create
       radar tech for the cold war. I really don't see investment as an
       issue. It's a problem when it's useless investment or
       bad oversight.
       The industrial revolution kicked off in the uk because of the
       environment (wanting to drain ever deeper mines) and ip law were
       you could use a patent to make money from your invention. For a
       long time the steam engines ran ahead of the basic science.
       Did the roman empire really invent all that much? It wasn't in it's
       cultural DNA, it was the Greek city states where interesting things
       happened.
       China invented a massive amount of fundemental ideas and machines.
       It just failed to pass that tipping point of feedback where each
       invention allows and enourages additional refinement.
       There's also IBM with Watson and some brain emulation projects.
       Lockheed skunkworks and it's reactor. Xerox had their famous
       research center but it was Jobs and Gates who ended up
       commericializing the ideas. Bell labs gave birth to Shannon's
       communication paper
       The 3d printing stuff is also exciting and coming from quite a
       historical traditional base of tinkerers, reminscent of the home
       computer boom

    6. I'm not sure which Big Problem Google Glass is trying to solve,
       unless it is coming up with a cheap way for the government to spy
       on everyone without having to use a massive police force.

    7. Daniel, you're kidding, right? Virtually every fundamental advance
       in computing has been the result of government funded research.
       Such funding has sometimes preceded commercialization by a decade
       or more. Think how long people were working on statistical pattern
       recognition/learning before it was applied to commercial products
       in machine translation or data mining, just to pick one example.
       Every major computer technology can similarly be traced back to
       government funded research.
