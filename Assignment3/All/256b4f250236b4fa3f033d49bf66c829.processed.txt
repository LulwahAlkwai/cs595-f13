   What a Smartwatch Will Need to iPod the Mobile Market
   In my weekly TGDaily column I look at what a Smartwatch will need to
   have to truly iPod the Smartwatch segment. Recall the MPS player market
   was a lot like the Smartwatch market when the iPod was announced. It
   wasn't owned by any vendor, most of the products had serious
   shortcomings and no one had discovered that one thing that would get
   people excited about the device. Apple blended design, user experience,
   and an impressive launch and marketing effort to create the iPod,
   something equally stunning will be needed if any vendor wants to have a
   shot, including Apple, at Apple's crown. By the way, at the very least,
   the display better be outdoor viewable. Full column in TGdaily today:
