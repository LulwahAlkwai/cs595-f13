   Fisker May Come Back From the Dead. German Engineers...
   Yes the Department of Energy is reviewing a bid for Fisker which could
   restore the brand. However, given these are German Engineers expect the
   result to be far more reliable but far less attractive. Now I could be
   wrong, Fisker himself (who designed the car) did come from BMW but he
   clearly put design in front of performance and the reliability of this
   care really sucked. Personally I thought the effort to put GM LS
   engines in them but left their looks intact to be more attractive. Good
   news for Fisker owners (well maybe) they might get someone to honor
   their warranties. Story in Green Car Reports today:
