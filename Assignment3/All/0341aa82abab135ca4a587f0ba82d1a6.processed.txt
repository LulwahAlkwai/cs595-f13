If This/Then That (IFTTT) and the Belkin WeMo

How I used an Internet service to automate home lighting without installing
any software.

   by [18]Matthew Gast | [19]@MatthewSGast | [20]Comment: 1 | August 20,
   2013

   Like most good technologists, I am lazy.  In practice, this sometimes
   means that I will work quite hard with a computer to automate a task
   that, for all intents and purposes, just isn't that hard.  In fits and
   starts for the past 10 years, I have been automating my house in
   various ways.  It makes my life easier when I am at home, though it
   does mean that friends who watch my house when I'm gone need to be
   briefed on how to use it.  If you are expecting to come into my house
   and use light switches and the TV as you do every place else, well,
   that's why you need a personalized orientation to the house.

   In this post, I'll talk briefly about one of the most basic automation
   tasks I've carried out, which is about how the lights in my house are
   controlled.

   The humble light switch was invented in the late 19th century, with the
   "modern" toggle switch following in the early 20th century.  The toggle
   switch has not changed in about 100 years because it does exactly what
   is needed and is well understood.  The only disadvantage to the toggle
   switch is that you have to touch it to operate it, and that means
   getting off the couch.

   My current home is an older home that was previously a storefront.  All
   the plumbing is on one wall of the house, which I sometimes jokingly
   call "the wall of modernity."  The telephone demarc is on the opposite
   side, though I've made some significant modifications to the telephone
   wiring from the days when I was using Asterisk more extensively.  As a
   large open space, there is not much built-in lighting, so most of the
   lights are freestanding floor lamps.

   The initial "itch" that I was scratching with my first home automation
   project was a consistent forgetfulness to turn off lights when I went
   to bed -- I would settle into bed up in the loft and then realize that
   I needed to get up and turn off a light.  At that point, remote
   controlled lights seemed pretty darn attractive.

   My first lighting automation was done with [21]Insteon, a superset of
   the venerable 1970s-era [22]X10 protocol.  With Insteon controls, I
   could use an RF remote and toggle lights on and off from a few
   locations within the house.

   With the hardware in place, I turned to finding software.  An RF remote
   is a good start, but I wanted to eliminate even that.  What I found is
   that the home automation community doesn't really have off-the-shelf
   software that "just works" and lets you start doing things out of the
   box.  I used [23]Mister House for a while, but at the time I was using
   it, the Insteon support was pretty new.  I worked with a friend writing
   some automation code -- well to be honest, being a tester for him, but
   we were solving problems unique to our homes, not writing something
   that was ultimately going to be the answer for our parents.

   Earlier this year, I was introduced to [24]IFTTT, which stands for "If
   This, Then That."  It is the closest thing I have seen to a generic
   software stack that can readily be used for home automation purposes.
   IFTTT can be used for much more than just home automation, but I'm
   going to stick to that restricted use for the purpose of this post.

   There is much to like about IFTTT, so I'll focus on just a few
   attributes:
     * Programming without knowing programming.  I've taken enough
       computer science courses to know how to write a program, but I'm
       not good enough to be a professional programmer.  IFTTT lets you
       write rules -- essentially, programs that control objects in the
       physical world -- without the high bar of learning specialized
       syntax or all the system administration work that goes along with
       running a program.
     * Extending control beyond my home.  Traditional home automation has
       been based on sensors inside the home.  In order to respond to
       something, there needs to be a sensor to gather that data.  To turn
       the lights on after dark, you need a sensor that tells your house
       it's dark.  To do something when it's raining, you need a sensor
       that gets wet, and so forth.  As you'll see, IFTTT lets you choose
       a location and use information from Internet services to assemble
       the context.
     * One of the cleanest and easiest designs I've seen.  I know
       everybody brags about design, but IFTTT is so simple that a
       colleague of mine in sales uses IFTTT extensively.  (Insert your
       own joke about the technical competence of sales representatives
       here.)

   To act in the physical realm of my house, though, IFTTT requires
   devices that can take action.  The [25]Belkin WeMo is a family of
   products, including a remote-controlled electrical outlet, light
   switch, and motion sensor.  The WeMo uses Wi-Fi to connect to my home
   network, so it can be controlled by any device on my network, or any
   service on the Internet.

   So, let's start out with a simple idea: I have a light, and I'd like to
   turn the light on when it's dark.  In traditional home automation, I
   can easily do that by picking a time to turn the light on and using the
   same time every day.  If I pick a time that is appropriate for the
   winter, though, the light will come on too early in June.  If I pick a
   time that is right for June, I'll have to get up and turn the lights on
   in December when it gets dark.  Or, using traditional home automation,
   I could find a source of sunset times, pull them in manually, and hope
   the data feed I'm using never changes.

   That is, until IFTTT.  In this example, I'll show you how to set up a
   WeMo to have a light that turns on at sunset.  IFTTT mini-programs are
   called "Recipes" and consist of a trigger and an action.  Building a
   recipe is a straightforward guided process that begins by picking the
   trigger:

   [26]IFTTT mini-programs IFTTT mini-programs

   IFTTT's interaction with the world is organized into "channels," and
   more channels are being added on a routine basis.  The first step in
   creating a recipe is to choose the trigger:

   [27]choose the trigger choose the trigger

   Triggers are organized alphabetically.  I cut the screen shot off after
   F because I wanted to get down to W for Weather and WeMo.  The first
   time you select the weather channel, you'll be prompted to set a
   location; I chose my home in San Francisco:

   [28]set a location set a location

   The weather channel has a number of components that you can choose to
   use as a trigger.  Some are expected, such as the weather forecast.
   However, the weather channel also allows you to take actions when
   conditions change.  The weather data used by IFTTT is also rich enough
   to have pollen count and UV index, which are not always readily
   available from many forecasts.  For the purpose of our example, we'll
   be using the "sunset" option, though it's easy to imagine creating
   triggers to control lights when the sky becomes cloudy or turning on
   air filtration when the pollen count rises:

   [29]the sunset option the sunset option

   Some triggers require additional configuration.  Sunset is
   straightforward because it's known for the location that you chose:

   [30]additional configuration additional configuration

   Here at step three, the first part of the rule is done.  We have set up
   a rule that will fire every day at sunset.  IFTTT helpfully fills in
   the "this" part of our rule in a way that makes it obvious what we're
   doing:

   [31]first part of the rule is done first part of the rule is done

   The second part of writing a rule is to lay out the action (the "that")
   to take when the trigger fires.  Once again, we choose a channel to
   take the action, choosing from the large number of channels that are
   available:

   [32]lay out the action lay out the action

   We're trying to control lights plugged into a Belkin WeMo, so we'll
   scroll down to "W" and pick the WeMo.  It has the actions that you
   might expect from what is essentially a power switch: turn off the
   outlet, turn on the outlet, blink the outlet, or toggle the outlet.  In
   our case, we want to turn on the outlet to turn on the light:

   [33]turn the outlet to turn the light on turn the outlet to turn the
   light on

   From the menu of options, choose "turn on."  IFTTT supports having
   multiple WeMo switches, each of which can be named.  A drop-down allows
   you to choose the switch being controlled by the rule so that many
   different devices can be controlled.  For example, a coffeepot might be
   turned on when an alarm goes off, different lights might be controlled
   by different rules, and so forth:

   [34]drop-down allows you to choose the switch being controlled
   drop-down allows you to choose the switch being controlled

   The last step in creating a rule is to finalize the action.  IFTTT
   helpfully displays the rule in full in a nice simple form.  Is there
   any doubt what the rule we've just created will do:

   [35]finalize the action finalize the action

   In my personal setup, I use a rule that turns off the light at 10 p.m.
   as a reminder to go to bed.  There is not yet an easy way to say "turn
   off the light two hours after it turned on" because IFTTT doesn't hold
   much state (yet).

   One aspect of IFTTT that I recently appreciated was how easy it is to
   change the rule.  When going out of town, I decided to have the lights
   on all night so that pet sitters wouldn't have to figure out all the
   ways in which lights could be turned on.  I simply deactivated the
   "turn off at 10 p.m." rule that was like this:

   [36]deactivated the "turn off at 10 pm" rule deactivated the "turn off
   at 10 pm" rule

   I then replaced it with a rule that turned off the lights at sunrise.
   (The lights in question are a low-power strand of LED lights.)

   [37]replaced it with a rule that turned off the lights at sunrise
   replaced it with a rule that turned off the lights at sunrise

   Could I have accomplished the same tasks in other home automation
   systems?  Absolutely, but it would have taken me much longer to get to
   my end goal, and I would have had to do significantly more testing to
   believe that my automation would behave as expected.  The combination
   of IFTTT and the WeMo makes setup much easier and more accessible.

       I used this walkthrough to get my wife on board with IFTTT and
       WeMo. Thanks
