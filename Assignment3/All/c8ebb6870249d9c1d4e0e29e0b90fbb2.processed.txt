   "Statistics is a science in my opinion, and it is no more a branch of
   mathematics than are physics, chemistry and economics;  for if its
   methods fail the test of experience - not the test of logic - they are
   discarded."  - John Wilder Tukey

   "Box plot," "stem and leaf plot," ANOVA" and, yes, even "bit,"
   "software" and "vacuum cleaner" are terms coined by this month's
   [91]featured statistician - John Wilder Tukey - whom we are honoring as
   part of celebrating the [92]International Year of Statistics. Tukey's
   impact on science and society is so wide and significant that I will
   only highlight a few areas here. As a side note, Tukey's influence on
   [93]JMP is also significant, and I'll save an interesting connection
   for the end of this blog post.

   Many recognize Tukey as the father of exploratory data analysis, in
   part for creating many effective visual techniques such as the box plot
   and stem and leaf plot, which are standards in introductory statistics
   courses today. He made many enduring contributions in time series,
   multiple comparisons, ANOVA, robust statistics, and interactive and
   multivariate graphics, too. Tukey considered himself a "scientific
   generalist" and influenced many other scientific fields, including
   computer science, mathematics, engineering and economics. He even
   served as an adviser on environmental, defense and education policy to
   the highest levels of US government. He collaborated with scientists
   such as Von Neumann, Feynman, Cooley and Morganstern, and served as
   doctoral adviser to many great statisticians.

   Tukey was born on June 16, 1915, in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and was
   mostly home-schooled as a child. At the age of 18, he entered Brown
   University and earned his BS and MS in chemistry, thereafter pursuing a
   PhD at Princeton. Soon after arriving at Princeton, his graduate
   studies evolved toward mathematics. Tukey's studies focused mostly on
   pure mathematics, and his thesis, "On Denumerability in Topology," was
   published as a book in 1940; mathematician Paul Halmos includes that
   book among the influential books of the period 1888-1988. After earning
   his PhD, Tukey became Math Instructor at Princeton and two years later
   Assistant Professor of Mathematics. By then, the US was engaged in
   World War II, and like many other leading academic institutions at that
   time, Princeton was involved in research to support the war effort.

   The Fire Control Research Office under the direction of Merrill Flood
   was located in Princeton, and Tukey joined the office as Consultant in
   1941. The office worked on practical problems of warfare, and these led
   to the use of statistics and association with statisticians such as
   Charlie Winsor, whom Tukey credits with converting his interests toward
   statistics.

     "He (Charlie Winsor) was data-oriented. I well remember walking up
     past by old Fine hall and hearing Charlie say, `Well, Sam Wilks
     trains good mathematical statisticians, and it's surprising how soon
     they become good statisticians.' But, associating with Charlie and
     living in the data-rich environment where what we were doing was
     trying to make sense out of data left me with an ultimate
     data-orientation." - Tukey

   Tukey returned to teaching after the war, and began a transition to
   statistics research and service in the years immediately following.
   Within the math department, Tukey joined the Section of Mathematical
   Statistics, which was headed by mathematical statistician Samuel Wilks.
   The Applied Statistics seminar began in 1946, introducing many
   state-of-the-art concepts to the graduate community at Princeton. He
   became Professor of Mathematics in 1950, Chair of the newly formed
   Statistics Department in 1966 and was Professor of Statistics and
   Donner Chair of Science until his retirement from Princeton in 1985.

     "..the first time I was in a Statistics course, I was there to teach
     it."  - Tukey

   In 1945, Tukey also began his 40-year association with Bell
   Laboratories. The parent company's focus and expertise in
   communications and technology provided valuable research, in part, to
   support of national security interests. Beginning in 1960, Tukey served
   as a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee and over the
   course of his career advised five US presidents. This work involved
   advising on environmental and education policy, and in the early 1960s,
   policy on nuclear weapons testing. It was in this capacity that one of
   his most important discoveries was made.

   While serving on President Kennedy's Science Advisory committee with
   the physicist Richard Garwin, the problem of off-shore monitoring and
   verification of a possible nuclear test ban treaty with Russia was
   discussed. Garwin and Tukey devised a potential solution that involved
   a method of monitoring seismic activity with remote sensors and
   analyzing their signals to distinguish an earthquake from a nuclear
   test. From this discussion and further work by James Cooley of IBM, the
   Cooley -Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm was developed. The
   Cooley-Tukey algorithm was a substantial simplification and vast
   improvement on calculations of Fourier series and integrals.

     "If you speed up any nontrivial algorithm by a factor of a million
     or so the world will beat a path towards finding useful applications
     for it." - from Numerical Recipes

   A Few Important Contributions
     * Exploratory Data Analysis: Tukey developed useful techniques for
       visualizing and summarizing data, the 5-number summary, box plots,
       and stem and leaf diagram. His book Exploratory Data Analysis
       published in 1977 introduced many of these techniques at a time
       when elementary statistical education was mainly focused on
       Inference and hypothesis testing. "Since the aim of exploratory
       data analysis is to learn what seems to be, it should be no
       surprise that pictures play a vital role in doing it well. There is
       nothing better for making you think of questions you had forgotten
       to ask (even mentally)," Tukey said.

     * Interactive Multivariate Graphics: In 1972, Tukey spent four months
       at Stanford's Linear Accelerator Center. He worked with Jerome
       Freidman on the development of PRIM-9, which was the first computer
       program that offered interactive and dynamic multivariate graphics.
       Features such as rotation and masking (brushing) were developed,
       along with the concept of Projection Pursuit in this work.

     * Multiple Comparisons: Some of Tukey's earliest work in statistics
       focused on Multiple Comparisons. The Tukey-Kramer test or Tukey HSD
       (Honestly Significant Difference) test is a standard used in ANOVA
       for pairwise comparisons more than 60 years after it was
       introduced.

     * Robust statistics: According to Peter J. Huber, Tukey was "the
       first to recognize the extreme sensitivity of some conventional
       statistical procedures to seemingly minor deviations from the
       assumptions.... In Tukey's view, robustness is an attribute of the
       statistical procedure, typically to be achieved by weighting or
       trimming the observations. This ought to be contrasted to say,
       George Box's view, who thought the data should not be tampered with
       and that the model itself should be robust."

     "Once upon a time statisticians only explored, then they learned to
     confirm exactly - to confirm a few things exactly, each under very
     specific circumstances. As they emphasized exact confirmation, their
     techniques inevitably became less flexible. The connection of the
     most used techniques with past insights was weakened.  Anything to
     which a confirmatory procedure was not explicitly attached was
     decried as 'mere descriptive statistics' no matter how much we had
     learned from it."  - Tukey

   Tukey earned many awards, including the National Medal of Science, the
   Samuel S. Wilks award, the Shewhart Medal, the IEEE Medal of Honor and
   the Deming Medal. He died on July 26, 2000, in New Brunswick, New
   Jersey. He made many other contributions that are covered in greater
   detail elsewhere, and I reference a few sources below. In particular,
   David Brillinger's piece provides many firsthand insights into the life
   and work of Tukey.

   The Anscombe Connection

   John Tukey's brother-in-law was Francis J. Anscombe - their wives were
   sisters. Anscombe was a British statistician who joined Tukey at
   Princeton for a while and shared many similar views when it came to
   data analysis and the use of graphics. Anscombe left Princeton for Yale
   and was a pioneer in the emerging field of statistical computing. In
   1973, the American Statistician published his article, "Graphics in
   Statistical Analysis." The "quartet" was introduced in this paper to
   motivate the concept that statistical graphics often reveal
   understanding that is not apparent from statistics alone and should
   accompany the analysis of data. The "quartet" (at right) clearly
   illustrates four very different graphs of data. But if you only looked
   at the statistical results that are identical, you would conclude that
   each bivariate analysis were the same.

   As Anscombe said, "A computer should make both calculations and graphs.
   Both sorts of output should be studied; each will contribute to
   understanding."

   These recommendations influenced a young developer and motivated the
   development of a new and innovative data analysis software that was
   launched in the late 1980s. The software was [94]JMP, and the developer
   [95]John Sall.

   You can access the data table and script for Anscombe's quartet in
   JMP's sample data directory (Help > Sample Data > See an Alphabetical
   List of all Sample Data Tables > Anscombe).

       When I asked one of my stat mentor's WHY Tukey used the magic 1.5
       multiplier in his box and whisker plot to denote expected range of
       raw data relative to the IQR (box) and thus highlight outliers, he
       said that he once asked Tukey that same question, and the answer
       was "it seems to work."
       If anyone has also heard that story, or has different viewpoint,
       please comment.
       We engineers were often given stories like that by stat gurus to
       help us remember concepts.

            If the data were normally distributed with a mean of zero and
            a standard deviation of one, then the IQR would be about 1.35.
            The top of the wisker would be at 0.67+1.5*1.35 = 2,695. The
            probability of being between -2.695 and +2.695 is a little
            larger than 99%. So, for normal data the range box plus the
            whiskers should contain roughly 99% of the observations.
            Of course, Tukey did not want to make any distributional
            assumption. For different distributions the exact percentage
            of observations you would expect to fall inside the whiskers
            would vary a bit. That did not worry Tukey. The "magic" 1.5 is
            a convenient rule of thumb that does, in fact, seem to work.
            Sometimes loose language is useful allowing one to avoid
            unimportant detail.

       I'd like to emphasize Tukey's contributions through his students.
       He produced 55 PhDs, including his EDA desciples Hartigan, Hoaglin,
       and Mosteller. In all, he has almost 1,200 "descendants," who were
       influenced by his views on how to analyze data. For a complete
       list, see [127]http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=15860
