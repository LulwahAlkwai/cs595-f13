[40]It Takes 2.99 Gigajoules To Vaporize a Human Body 272

   Posted by [41]Soulskill on Friday September 13, 2013 @06:36PM
   from the just-so-you-know dept.
   Have you ever wondered how much energy is needed to power a phaser set
   to kill? A trio of researchers at the University of Leicester did, so
   they [42]ran some tests and found out [43]it would take roughly 2.99 GJ
   to vaporize an average-sized adult human body. Quoting: "First,
   consider the true vaporization - the complete separation of all atoms
   within a molecule - of water. With a simple molecular structure
   containing an oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms, it takes
   serious energy to break these bonds. In fact, it takes 460 kilojoules
   of energy to break just one mole of oxygen-hydrogen bonds -- around the
   same energy that a 2,000-pound car going 70 miles per hour on the
   highway has in potential. And that's just 18 grams of water! So as you
   can see, it would take a gargantuan amount of energy to separate all
   the atoms in even a small glass of water -- especially if that glass of
   water is your analog for a person. The human body is a bit more
   complicated than a glass of water, but it still vaporizes like one. And
   thanks to our spies spread across scientific organizations, we now have
   the energy required to turn a human into an atomic soup, to break all
   the atomic bonds in a body. According to the captured study, it takes
   around three gigajoules of death-ray to entirely vaporize a person --
   enough to completely melt 5,000 pounds of steel or simulate a lightning
   bolt."

[89]3 GJ to vaporize? ([90]Score:3, Interesting)

                           and that if you released that energy -- like an

                      But it's all irrelevant, because OP's main premise
                      is obviously false.
                      If we want to take the situation even a little bit
                      literally, then a phaser could not be "vaporizing"
                      its target. If it did, there would be a tremendous
                      explosion. In fact, 2.99 GJ worth of "boom".
                      But we don't see that. Therefore a phaser could not
                      be a "vaporizer" at all. Nor could it be a
                      "molecular dissociation" device because the result
                      could be the same.
                      I would have to theorize that it was some kind of

                 Often on TV, killing is actually easier than dealing with
                 the bodies. The network censors really hate bloody
                 corpses, but have less objection to the process of making
                 them. A common solution is to introduce either mooks that
                 conveniently diappear when dead (See Buffy, Charmed - the
                 prefered fantasy solution) or weapons which leave no body
                 (See half the weapons in Doctor Who or STs phasors - the
                 prefered sci-fi solution).
                 The vaporisation option usually ignores the difficulty of
                 where approximately eighty kilograms of water vapor is
                 going to end up - boiling a human in such a short time
                 would result in a blast of high-pressure superheated
                 steam and organic soup.

            Hang on a moment... TFA isn't talking about vaporizing -
            turning water to steam. It's talking about ionizing, which is
            clearly going to require a much bigger quantity of energy.
            For actual vaporization, making a very rough calculation -
            60kg person, 2,270 kJ/kg latent heat of vaporization of water
            = 136 MJ,
            Sure there's specific heat to add in there too, but the
            vaporization of water is the dominant term, so it's at least
            out by an order of magnitude.
            Lesson learned - don't try and be 'all sciency' and use the
            wrong jargon!

       Since when does "vaporization" involve breaking chemical bonds
       inside a molecule? When you boil water you're not turning it into
       hydrogen and oxygen, you're just overcoming the vanderWaals bonds
       keeping the liquid together and giving them enough energy to float
       away. Likewise if you "vaporize" someone. You need enough energy to
       turn them from a solid/colloid state to a gaseous state, not the
       energy required to reduce the person to elemental atoms.

       Directly providing the power to vaporize a person is not the
       elegant way to do it. The correct, elegant mad scientist method is
       to use the power contained in the vaporized mass to power the
       vaporization.
       Consider if you develop a means to "program" a plasma such that it
       generates a contracting magnetic field that causes fusion inside
       the vaporizing object and then absorbs some of the energy from this
       fusion reaction to power itself.
       Now you're talking! Now you've got an effect that can vaporize any
       object provided you can provide the initial energy requirement.
       There could be variants on this. Perhaps you've got an effect that
       flips matter into antimatter and absorbs some of the released
       energy to continue the effect.
       If this is an expanding effect instead of a collapsing effect
       you've got a world killer like the weapons in Ender's Game.

       I'm going to do some rough calculations - the paper's computation
       is also pretty rough - just to get the right order of magnitude.
       First of all, to vaporize water, you don't even need to boil it.
       Spill some water on the floor and it vaporizes pretty darn quick
       just from the ambient environment - it changes from liquid water at
       room temperature to water vapor at room temperature. The only heat
       that needs to be added is the "Enthalpy of vaporization" which is
       2260 kJ/Kg. For the 78kg human described in the paper, if it were
       all water, that would only be 176 Megajoules. Given that a human is
       normally at about 37C and room temperature about 25C, you can also
       take away 4kJ/Kg*78Kg*(37-25) = 4 Megajoules that the water vapor
       releases as you cool it from 37C to 25C. The net result is that
       with 172 Megajoules, you can turn a human body's mass of water to
       vapor.
       However, as the paper suggests, the body isn't all water - it's
       about 85% water and 15% "dried pork." That means 172MJ*0.7 for the
       water, 146MJ, and the 11.7Kg of pork releases about 4KCal/g when
       oxidized (4 dietary Calories/g), 1 Kcal=4.2KJ, so burning the
       "dried pork" releases 196MJ. Assuming the "dried pork" gets fully
       oxidized (i.e burned) into CO2, the result is a gas. So overall,
       vaporizing a human body (in the sense of turning all the body into
       a gas) can release more energy than you started with - about 50MJ.
       The paper estimates the energy required to break every molecular
       bond. However, all those bonds are going to reassemble into
       something else, whether into H2, O2, or H2O, or including the
       "dried pork," CO2, releasing much of the energy back.

[556]They don't know anything about phasers ([557]Score:3)

       Everybody knows that when set to kill the phaser emits high energy
       polarized tachyons that send most of the mass into other
       dimensions. From the PoV of the infinite other universes a harmless
       burst of neutrinos occurs at several random locations. The matter
       that doesn't get transferred by the tachyons may remain as a dusty
       residue, but that's only if the phase correlator is poorly
       adjusted. Properly maintained phasers set to kill won't do that.
       And yes, I just made all that up, and some of it is mumbo-jumbo.
       That's how Star Trek technology works. Dammit Jim, I'm a Slashdot
       poster, not a phaser technician. Why do I have to explain this?

       The only "reasonable" explanation within the Star Trek canon (if
       the term applies) is that the corpses are pushed "out of phase" or
       into subspace or something. Otherwise, there really is no place for
       the mass to go.

            Depends on how quickly you want it done.
            If you wanted it done in 2.5 seconds, 1.21 gigawatts would be
            perfect.

            indeed, let's just consider the human body a bag of water. To
            raise 75 kg of water 70 degrees C requires 4 kilojoules per kg
            for each degree, so 21 MJ. But then to vaporize water at 100
            degrees C is 2.3 MJ / kg or 172 MJ. So our answer is about 200
            MJ. A gallon of gasoline is about 130 MJ, so the energy in
            about one and a half gallons would do the job. Or if your home
            pulls 12.4 KWhour a day in the summer that's 44 MJ, so less
