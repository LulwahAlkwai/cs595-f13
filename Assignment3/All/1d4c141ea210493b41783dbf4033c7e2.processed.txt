   Fbi-microsoft-bitlocker-backdoor
   [47]Lorenzo-headshot-sq
   By Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai2013-09-11 13:27:43 UTC

   The [48]NSA is reportedly not the only government agency asking tech
   companies for help in cracking technology to access user data. Sources
   say the [49]FBI has a history of requesting digital backdoors, which
   are generally understood as a hidden vulnerability in a program that
   would, in theory, let the agency peek into suspects' computers and
   communications.

   In 2005, when [50]Microsoft was about to launch [51]BitLocker, its
   Windows software to encrypt and lock hard drives, the company
   approached the NSA, its British counterpart the [52]GCHQ and the FBI,
   among other government and law-enforcement agencies. Microsoft's goal
   was twofold: get feedback from the agencies, and sell BitLocker to
   them.

   See also: [53]Is It the Dawn of the Encryption App?

   But the FBI, concerned about its ability to fight crime --
   specifically, child pornography -- apparently repeatedly asked
   Microsoft to put a backdoor in the software. A backdoor -- or trapdoor
   -- is a secret vulnerability that can be exploited to break or
   circumvent supposedly secure systems.

   For its part, the FBI categorically denies asking for such access,
   telling Mashable that the Bureau doesn't ask for backdoors, and that it
   only serves companies lawful court orders when it needs to access
   users' data. (And, legally, it would still need a warrant even if a
   backdoor did exist.)

   Peter Biddle, the head of the engineering team working on BitLocker at
   the time, revealed to Mashable the exchanges he had with various
   government agents.

   "I was asked multiple times," Biddle told us, confirming that a
   government agency had inquired about backdoors, though he couldn't
   remember which one. "And at least once the question was more, 'If we
   were to officially ask you, what would you say?'"

   According to two former Microsoft engineers, FBI officials complained
   that BitLocker would make their jobs harder. "It's going to be really
   really hard for us to do our jobs if every single person could have
   this technology. How do we break it?" an FBI agent reportedly said.

   The story of how the FBI reportedly asked Microsoft to backdoor
   BitLocker to avoid "going dark," the FBI's term for a potential
   scenario when encryption makes it impossible to intercept criminals'
   communications or break into a suspect's computer, provides a snapshot
   into how U.S. government agencies may try to persuade tech companies to
   weaken their security products, or even poke a hidden hole to make them
   wiretap-friendly.

   Last week, [54]The New York Times, [55]ProPublica, and [56]The Guardian
   revealed that one of the ways the NSA circumvents Internet cryptography
   is [57]to ask companies to put backdoors in their products.

   The FBI is reportedly doing the same in the name of fighting crime, and
   its persuasion techniques appear to be very similar.

   According to reports, both the NSA and the FBI are subtle in their
   requests, which are never formal, written requests, but are usually
   uttered during casual conversations, almost jokingly.

   Nico Sell, the founder of the privacy-enhancing app [58]Wickr, was
   approached by an FBI agent after speaking at the security conference
   RSA at the end of February, [59]as first reported by CNET. "So are you
   gonna give us a backdoor?" the agent asked, according to Sell. She
   declined, and after pressing the agent -- asking him to explain if he
   had a written request and to reveal his boss -- the agent backed down.

   Cryptography and security expert Bruce Schneier said he's heard of
   these same types of tactics from others the government has approached
   seeking technological backdoors.

   "It's not an explicit ask, [...] it's an informal, oblique mention,
   joking conversation, where you're felt out as to whether you're
   amenable to it," Schneier told Mashable. "If you're amenable to it,
   that conversation continues, if you're not, it's like it never
   happened."

   Schneier is working with The Guardian on new, undisclosed documents
   provided by NSA leaker [60]Edward Snowden. And he is now [61]looking
   for whistleblowers in the tech industry who are willing to share their
   experience with government officials asking for backdoors.

   Despite the requests being informal, Schneier and other surveillance
   experts are concerned.

   "A request is a request," and despite not being illegal, he said, "it's
   coercive."

   Peter Biddle Peter Biddle

The FBI's Informal Request to Microsoft

   In the case of Microsoft, according to the engineers, the requests came
   in the course of multiple meetings with the FBI. These kinds of
   meetings were standard at Microsoft, according to both Biddle and
   another former Microsoft engineer who worked on the BitLocker team, who
   wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.

   "I had more meetings with more agencies that I can remember or count,"
   said Biddle.

   Biddle said these meetings were so frequent, and with so many different
   agencies, he doesn't specifically remember if it was the FBI that asked
   for a backdoor. But the anonymous Microsoft engineer we spoke with
   confirmed that it was, in fact, the FBI.

   During a meeting, an agent complained about BitLocker and expressed his
   frustration.

   "Fuck, you guys are giving us the shaft," the agent said, according to
   Biddle and the Microsoft engineer, who were both present at the
   meeting. (Though Biddle insisted he didn't remember which agency he
   spoke with, he said he remembered this particular exchange.)

   Biddle wasn't intimidated. "No, we're not giving you the shaft, we're
   merely commoditizing the shaft," he responded.

   Biddle, a believer in what he refers to as "neutral technology," never
   agreed to put a backdoor in BitLocker. And other Microsoft engineers,
   [62]when rumors spread that there was one, later denied that was ever a
   possibility.

   "The suggestion is that we are working with governments to create a
   backdoor so that they can always access BitLocker-encrypted data,"
   [63]wrote Niels Ferguson, Microsoft's cryptographer and principal
   software development engineer. "Over my dead body."

   For Biddle, this was proof of a fundamental paradox facing government
   agencies and security software. How do you get secure software you can
   rely on, while also retaining the ability to break into it if people
   use it to commit or cover up their crimes?

   "I realized that we were in this really interesting spot, sort of stuck
   in the middle between wanting to do a much better job at protecting our
   users' information, and at the same time realizing that this was
   starting to make government employees unhappy," Biddle said.

   Despite Microsoft's refusals to backdoor its product, the engineers
   kept working with the FBI to teach them about BitLocker and how it was
   possible to retrieve data in case an agent needed to get into an
   encrypted hard drive.

   At one point, the BitLocker team suggested the agency target the backup
   keys that the software creates. In some instances, BitLocker prompts
   users to print out a piece of paper with the key needed to unlock the
   hard drive, to prevent loss of data if a user forgets his or her key.

   "As soon as we said that, the mood in the room changed dramatically,"
   said the anonymous Microsoft engineer. "They got really excited."

   In that instance, law enforcement agents wouldn't need a backdoor after
   all. As the engineer suggested, all they would need was a warrant to
   access a suspect's documents and retrieve the document that would
   unlock his or her hard drive.

   Microsoft and Skype Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer

Microsoft's Tarnished Privacy Reputation

   For Christopher Soghoian, a privacy and surveillance expert at the
   American Civil Liberties Union, the fact that BitLocker had a backdoor
   or not isn't even that relevant, since it's a feature that very few
   Windows users employ or even have access to. It's not included in most
   Windows versions, and it's not a default setting -- something that,
   Soghoian said "is not an accident."

   "The impact is minimal, because so few people use BitLocker, but it
   does speak to a friendly relationship between the companies and the
   government," he told Mashable.

   This incident confirms something that Soghoian and other Microsoft
   critics have pointed out repeatedly over the last few years.

   "If you want to keep your data out of the U.S. government's hands,
   Microsoft is not your friend," he said. "Microsoft is unwilling to
   really make the government go dark. They are never really willing to
   protect their customers from the government. They are willing to take
   some steps but they don't want to go too far."

   In fact, in the last few years, Microsoft's commitment to users'
   privacy has been repeatedly put into question.

   Microsoft [64]has been accused of changing Skype's infrastructure to
   make it easier for governments to intercept and spy on users' calls and
   chats.

   Documents provided by Snowden to The Guardian suggest Microsoft [65]has
   been very cooperative in making it easier to eavesdrop on its products,
   including [66]Outlook, [67]Hotmail, and [68]Skype.

   The company even [69]seemed to suggest that Skype calls are fair game
   for the NSA, in a response to that report, despite the fact that,
   historically, Skype insisted its calls were impossible to intercept.

   Even a Microsoft former employee seems skeptical of the company's
   policies regarding privacy. Caspar Bowden, the former chief privacy
   advisor at Microsoft Europe, who recently denounced the NSA's PRISM
   program, [70]describes himself on his Twitter account as "ex-Chief
   Privacy Adviser MSFT (hey, I tried)."

   A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment for this story, simply
   pointing us to a [71]June 16 blog post by Microsoft's General Counsel
   Brad Smith.

   The post, written in response to [72]the revelation of the NSA's top
   secret surveillance program, codenamed [73]PRISM, denies that Microsoft
   ever provides "any government with direct and unfettered access to our
   customer's data. Microsoft only pulls and then provides the specific
   data mandated by the relevant legal demand."

   Smith's post doesn't address Microsoft's relationship with government
   and law-enforcement agencies, and doesn't directly address the issue of
   three letter agencies informally asking for backdoors. The company's
   spokesperson also declined to elaborate on whether Microsoft seeks
   feedback from the NSA or the FBI when launching products.

   The anonymous Microsoft engineer, when talking about the company's
   relationship with the NSA, said that "they are very, very helpful to
   the Windows teams in terms of shoring up foolish little mistakes,"
   adding that such consulting doesn't imply anything "weird" or illegal.

The FBI's Fear of Going Dark

   The BitLocker story may be studied in the context of what the FBI calls
   the "[74]Going Dark" problem.

   In the last few years, the Bureau has argued that improved encryption
   technologies threaten its ability to snoop on a suspect's
   communications.

   It's with this potential threat in mind that the FBI [75]has been
   pushing for an expansion of the Communications Assistance for Law
   Enforcement Act ([76]CALEA), which compels telecommunication companies
   -- but not Internet companies like [77]Google, [78]Facebook or
   Microsoft -- to build wiretap-friendly communication systems.

   The effort, referred to as CALEA II, seems to have stalled, but the
   U.S. government's interest in defeating encryption with backdoors is
   long-standing.

   "The FBI has been wanting such access for just about as long as there
   has been an Internet," said Scott Bradner, a web governance expert and
   secretary of the Internet Society.

   During the so-called "Crypto Wars" of the 1990s, the government
   proposed the infamous [79]Clipper Chip, an NSA-made encryption device
   that included a backdoor for the government. The attempt to make it
   mandatory for telecommunications companies failed after public pressure
   against it, and after Matt Blaze, a cryptography expert, discovered a
   serious flaw in its design.

   But the FBI didn't stop worrying about encryption -- it ramped up its
   rhetoric.

   "The widespread use of uncrackable encryption will devastate our
   ability to fight crime and prevent terrorism," Louis Freeh, the FBI
   director at the time, [80]told Congress in 1997.

   In 2010, Valerie Caproni, at the time the FBI's general counsel,
   [81]told The New York Times that the FBI needed more wiretapping powers
   against encryption technologies.

   "No one should be promising their customers that they will thumb their
   nose at a U.S. court order," Caproni said. "They can promise strong
   encryption. They just need to figure out how they can provide us plain
   text."

   Such a plan has always received strong criticism from cryptography and
   security experts.

   [82]Columbia University professor Steven Bellovin said that inserting
   backdoors "[I]s a disaster waiting to happen. [...] If they start
   building in all these backdoors, they will be exploited."

   Bellovin's argument is simple: if the FBI, or the U.S. government,
   obtains a backdoor into a certain technology, that backdoor can be
   taken advantage of by hackers or cybercriminals as well.

   Blaze [83]echoed this sentiment in a column he co-wrote with privacy
   expert Susan Landau on Wired earlier this year.

   "Mandatory wiretap backdoors in Internet services would invite at least
   as much new crime as it could help solve," the two wrote.

   For all the FBI's complaints about the hazards of going dark, the
   numbers don't necessarily appear to back up such fears.

   According to the U.S. courts' annual [84]wiretap report, encryption
   prevented law enforcement agencies from obtaining communications four
   of the 15 times they encountered it in 2012. These four included the
   first time agencies had been thwarted by encryption since 2001, when
   the courts started publishing the stats.

   And even in cases involving full disk encryption -- and child
   pornography -- [85]the FBI has been able at times to crack it.

   "The idea that they're going dark is quite silly," said Dan Auerbach, a
   technologist at the digital rights advocacy group [86]Electronic
   Frontier Foundation.

   Nevertheless, an FBI spokesperson denied that the Bureau ever asks for
   backdoors, arguing that it's also important to define what a backdoor
   is.

   "We're not asking a company to give us unfettered access to a back
   channel so that we can get the information ourselves," FBI spokesperson
   Christopher Allen told Mashable. "To me that's what a backdoor
   implies."

   "We are only talking about lawful, court-ordered intercepts in on-going
   investigations," he explained in a follow-up email. However, he also
   added that: "The FBI might explain what obligations a company may have
   to comply with a court order and what is required pursuant to each
   order, but it is the responsibility of the company named in the court
   order to develop the means to perform the lawful intercept."

   Pressed for more comments on the specific cases illustrated in this
   story, Allen simply replied: "The FBI does not ask for backdoors.
   Period."
