                         The Maestro Concept
   American Society of Newspaper Editors, Small Newspapers Committee
   report cover.
   1995 American Society of Newspaper Editors, Small Newspapers Committee
   report cover.

   The Maestro Concept is a [15]time-management technique in journalism
   designed to assist a newsroom in creating a project-based,
   teamwork-intensive approach to quality reporting and presentation of
   news stories by "thinking like a reader."

   The Maestro Concept begins with a "great story idea" that is generated
   through collaborative idea-group meetings to shape stories before they
   are written and integrates writing, editing, photography, art and
   design.^[16][1] The Maestro Concept is not applied to all stories all
   the time. The concept applies only to those stories that are integrated
   with photographs, design elements and information graphics. It is a
   method designed to improve presentation of important stories through
   teamwork that brings the story to life and results in high impact and
   high readership.

History[17]Edit

   The Maestro Concept created by Leland "Buck" Ryan, now director of the
   Citizen Kentucky Project of the Scripps Howard First Amendment Center
   and tenured associate professor of journalism at the University of
   Kentucky's School of Journalism and Telecommunications. Ryan created
   the concept in the early 1990s when he was an assistant professor at
   Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. The inspiration
   for the Maestro Concept came from a 1991 Poynter Institute study by Dr.
   Mario Garcia and Dr. Pegie Stark called "Eyes on the News." That study
   followed the eyes of readers (tracked actual eye movements) in three
   cities and discovered that readers do not read a newspaper as
   journalists believed. This study^[18][2] and subsequent studies,
   including online publications, are used in newsrooms and classrooms
   today as a teaching model.^[19][3] The original study found that good
   indexing for busy readers is the key to successful publishing.^[20][4]

   The Maestro Concept was developed through an "approach to newsroom
   management, organization and operation that applies [21]W. Edwards
   Deming's management principles used in manufacturing to the creative
   process."^[22][5] Striving for quality, in both product and management,
   is Deming's focal point. As a statistician, Deming noted that when
   management focused primarily on costs, that approach over the long run
   drove up costs and diminished quality. Deming found that a focus by
   management to increase quality while reducing costs through reduction
   of waste and rework lowered costs in the long run. Continual
   improvement of the system, and not by bits and pieces, is integral to
   Deming's principles.

   The Maestro Concept debuted in April 1993 at the [23]American Society
   of News Editors convention in Baltimore, Maryland. After the debut, a
   list of 324 newspapers in the United States, in 59 newspaper groups,
   and more than 50 universities and high schools showed interest in the
   concept by purchasing a report and video entitled "The Maestro Concept:
   A New Approach to Writing and Editing for the Newspaper of the Future."
   The concept's impact covers 48 states and Washington, D.C., and 16
   other countries.^[24][6]

   A part of the international impact was a maestro workshop conducted in
   [25]Hanoi for Vietnamese print and online journalists in December 2006
   by Buck Ryan.^[26][7]

   In June 2010, three Russian journalism organizations invited Ryan to
   speak on the concept during 12 days of seminars: one was in Barnaul for
   the Press Development Institute-Siberia, a second in Kirov for the
   Russian Union of Journalists, and a third in Rostov-on-Don for the
   Alliance of Independent Regional Publishers of Russia. The director of
   the Press Development Institute-Siberia in Barnaul wrote that Ryan's
   "ideas spurred numerous projects that our regional newspapers are eager
   to carry out as soon as possible."^[27][8] Then in July, Ryan visited
   and served as the first journalism professor in residence as he taught
   two journalism courses in China for three weeks at [28]Shanghai
   University.^[29][9]

   High schools have increasingly used the Maestro Concept to introduce
   students on how a newsroom operates. The online [30]High School
   Journalism Initiative has lesson plans devoted to introducing high
   school students to the concept. One lesson plan titled "conducting the
   orchestra: how to implement maestro" details how students can be taught
   to build small teams that are able to motivate, be productive and
   encourage quality throughout the school year.^[31][10] High schools
   have reported that since the concept was introduced, students who have
   never before worked together find that they can coordinate fully
   reported stories and photos in one day. Besides meeting deadlines,
   students working together see that their story packages are of higher
   quality and often have a greater page presence.^[32][11]

   "The Maestro Concept" is presented in and is the title of Chapter Eight
   in the 2001 book, The Editor's Toolbox, A Reference Guide for Beginners
   and Professionals. Ryan co-authored the book with Michael O'Donnell.

Concept and quotations[33]Edit

   The Maestro Concept is a time-management technique for story planning
   and newsroom organization through team collaboration to shape stories
   early before they are written. The central concept is trying to
   anticipate readers' questions about news stories ("think like a
   reader") and then answering those questions as quickly as possible
   through visual aspects with high-visibility points such as photos,
   headlines, captions and [34]information graphics. It is a management
   technique to encourage collaboration across news departments and ensure
   that quality work in a story package comes not from the traditional
   method of an assembly-line process, but from teamwork and good
   time-management from all players working on the story.

   By connecting the different roles in a newsroom, a Maestro congeals the
   story planning process and pulls it all together by integrating the
   separate work done by writers, photographers, graphic designers and
   editors. These members will meet together in a maestro session and they
   will coordinate the story line and graphic design layout of how the
   story will be presented to readers.

     "Reinventing the Newsroom" by Carl Sessions Stepp from the American
     Journalism Review:
     * A guru in this area is Buck Ryan of the University of Kentucky ...
       His system involves a coordinating editor (the maestro), who
       convenes writer, copy editor and designer, very early in the
       process, to discuss story focus, illustration and packaging.

     * "Ryan says that if you allow everyone - from the editor to the
       library researcher - to contribute, and let the story idea drive
       the organization of the newsroom, then you break through."^[35][12]

     The Maestro Concept:
    1. Idea-group meetings
    2. The importance of coaching writers
    3. The challenges of hurdling newsroom traditions
    4. The maestro session in action
    5. A lesson in critiquing

     -- The Editor's Toolbox, A Reference Guide for Beginners and
     Professionals^[36][13]

   1. Idea-group meetings

   Generating story ideas is traditionally a job assigned to editors, but
   with the Maestro Concept an idea-group meeting contains reporters, copy
   editors, photographers, designers as well as various department
   editors. Non-traditional attendees such as librarians and office clerks
   may be included. Therefore, the field of creativity is expanded and
   allows for a wider breadth of inputs and ideas. Each of these members
   learns to team up and work across departments to more fully develop
   stories that engage and answer readers' questions about the story. The
   editing process has expanded and is no longer the sole province of
   various editors.

   This idea-group is [37]concentric with the inner ring comprising the
   top editor, section editors, star reporters and the known creative
   members of that media organization. The next ring will comprise the
   copy editors, photographers, designers, graphic artists, newsroom
   librarians and editorial assistants. The next ring extends to the staff
   members who are not in the newsroom such as circulation, production and
   the pressroom. The final outer ring reaches readers and reader advisory
   groups. The advisory groups provide background information and evaluate
   coverage.

   Idea-group meetings are short (15 to 20 minutes) and structured to have
   three rules: Story ideas can be suggested by anyone for any reason; a
   person suggesting a story idea will not have to be the one to write it;
   and there is no critiquing ideas, just listing ideas. Editors and
   decision-makers will determine the story list later and assign those
   stories to the best equipped staff.

   The frequency of idea-group meetings, whether weekly or monthly, has no
   set rule. Meetings are held on days when the largest number of staff
   can attend.

   2. The importance of coaching writers

   The editor or assistant editor acts as the "maestro" in development of
   a story and time-management of it after preliminary reporting.
   Preliminary reporting is complete when reporters know they have a story
   but are not clear on how best to tell it. A three-part test is applied
   while brainstorming with the reporter in a "pre-maestro check" to see
   if the reporter is at a point where he or she can summarize the essence
   of the story. To identify key reader questions, the editor and reporter
   complete a 30-word summary of the story, a preliminary headline, an
   early draft of a lead and then they isolate readers' top questions
   about that story.

   This brainstorming session, or pre-maestro check, is the time where the
   editor will decide whether to proceed with that story. If the
   pre-maestro check is successful, then a maestro session will be called
   to include a photographer, copy editor and page designer.

   A good maestro takes lots of notes from all the players during the
   development of the story package to make sure good ideas do not
   disappear. Throughout this session, the editor asks questions instead
   of delivering orders.

   3. The challenges of hurdling newsroom traditions

   A lot of newsrooms run an [38]assembly line approach to publication
   production where writers report to an editor to receive their
   assignments, write their articles, and then the editor creates photo
   assignments before the stories are ultimately compiled into a
   publication. Reporters traditionally follow three standard notions in
   an assembly-line approach to journalism. One, do all reporting before
   writing. Two, write the story, then discuss it with the editor. Three,
   don't write a headline, a copy editor will. The Maestro Concept
   challenges these notions and further challenges editors to be more
   successful by putting decision-making into the hands of those with the
   most expertise. For example, a photographer in a maestro session has
   more expertise about the best photo and does not need a photo
   assignment if he or she is involved early in the process.

   The trick is detaching traditionalists from the journalist mindset and
   instead thinking and observing like the reader. Readers of a
   publication are seeing more than just a story. To them, a story is
   composed of everything on the page: photos, headlines, graphics,
   captions, and text.^[39][14]

   The goal is to identify key reader questions and let them provide the
   framework for reporting and presentation of the story. Unlike the
   traditional approach where the answers to those questions lie in the
   text, answers to the key readers' questions go to high-visibility spots
   on the page, such as photos, headlines, captions, and sidebar boxes and
   graphics. If the reader-friendly index is successful, the reader is
   hooked and reads through the story.

   4. The maestro session in action

   The maestro session is a 10- to 15-minute teamwork exercise that begins
   after the "pre-maestro check." The maestro session is where the key
   players involved in a story package (i.e. the reporter, the editor, the
   photographer, the designer) sketch the presentation of the story before
   the writing is fleshed out. This maestro session is led by the
   "maestro," a senior editor or section editor. The key players draft
   headlines, the layout, arrange for the photo assignments, and establish
   deadlines and story lengths.

   The maestro session itself will then focus on the quality of the story
   to ensure relevance to the readers. The focus is on quickly answering
   the top questions on a reader's mind. Quality is built into the story
   from the very beginning with teamwork instead of waiting until the end
   to rely on inspection.

   The maestro session has three core components and works consecutively
   down them, thereby building quality along the way into these news
   stories. The concept is taught across the world through the use of a
   story planning form and its process to "think like a reader."
   [40]Think Like A Reader Story Plan.
   Maestro concept story plan - think like a reader.

          I. The first core component in the process is the "reader's
          viewpoint" a.k.a. "think like a reader."

               o First, essential questions that would immediately come to
                 a reader's mind in the story are asked

                (these questions are answered in the high-visibility
                points on the page).

               o Second, the question is asked, "What is the single most
                 important thing about the story?"
               o And finally, "Is there any way readers can take action in
                 response the story?"

          II. The second core component involves picturing the story on
          the page and its high-visibility
          points in the layout, including graphics that will quickly
          attract a reader's
          attention to the details of the story.
          Some of those integrated graphics that quickly tell the story
          are:

               o Quotation boxes
               o Question-and-answer boxes
               o Sidebar charts
               o Lists
               o Maps

          III. The third core component involves pulling all the parts of
          the team's work together
          (photo, headline, graphics and writing) along with any design
          elements. This involves a sketch of the story package showing
          where the key readers' questions are answered on the page.

     Getting the whole story: reporting and writing the news by Cheryl K.
     Gibbs and Tom Warhover:
     * Some newspapers use a group brainstorming strategy called "the
       maestro concept" to plan stories and visual elements
       simultaneously. This approach was developed in the early 1990s by
       journalism professor Leland "Buck" Ryan in collaboration with
       journalists at the Logansport (Ind.) Pharos-Tribune. Editors,
       reporters, page designers, photographers and artists meet about
       individual stories, after enough reporting has been done to get a
       sense of them. In each story meeting, a person designated as the
       maestro uses a story planning format to help the group (1) think
       through questions readers would have about the story, (2) refine
       the story concept, (3) picture it on the page and (4) identify
       challenges. In picturing the story on the page, they consider what
       kinds of photographs and/or informational graphics might be
       appropriate, what kinds of sidebars or pullouts could be written,
       and whether series logos or other graphic elements will be needed.
       In these discussions, the journalists sometimes go so far as to
       sketch out possible page designs.

     ^[41][15]

   5. Lessons in critiquing

   The maestro conducts follow ups or "audits" of the story package and
   asks for improved ideas and the story is fine-tuned.

   Each reader question will be revisited to identify where it was
   answered. The goal is to answer the questions in the "high visibility"
   positions of the story page: the headlines, photos, information
   graphics and quotes. These high visibility spots are "hooks" which will
   pull the reader into the story to read it fully. If say, during this
   critique tally of five top reader questions, only three of the top
   readers' questions are answered in these high visibility positions,
   that is a 60 percent efficiency rate. The team members will then
   ascertain why and how 5-out-of-5 questions could be answered. The goal
   is continuous improvement in identifying readers' questions and
   answering them through page design and writing approaches.

   The maestro concept respects the ability of journalists and team
   members to accurately list the top questions that readers would have of
   a story. Those "Reader's Viewpoints" would then provide the framework
   for the reporting, graphics and design layout that successfully tell
   that story with the highest impact.

Four-graph approach[42]Edit

   The four-graph approach to writing, editing, photography and design is
   meant to efficiently create an article designed for the reader. The
   design is partly based on the findings in the "Eyes on the News" study
   that found readers typically look at photos first, headlines second,
   captions third, and text fourth. The goal of this approach is to engage
   the readers by presenting the primary factual
   information.^[[43]citation needed]
   The [44]inverted pyramid technique of journalism writing
   Inverted pyramid inverted technique of journalism writing
    1. Who? A photo or illustration shows the readers.
    2. What? A headline quickly gives reason to the visual.
    3. When and Where? A caption to further engage readers.
    4. The lead follows and eases the reader into the rest of story,
       summarizing in an [45]inverted pyramid technique the
       who-what-when-where of journalism writing.

Frequent mistakes[46]Edit

   Mistakes point out three key areas:
    1. Maestroing can be a big help or a big waste of time, depending on
       the participants' attention to detail and willingness to follow
       through on a maestro plan. The maestro needs to be a vigilant
       shepherd.
    2. Managing change is difficult enough without mistakes that
       demoralize participants and lead to a loss of confidence in the
       system.

Benefits[47]Edit

     Benefits
    1. Fewer rewrites. Writers and editors see less need to rewrite
       stories because of missing information or organization problems.
    2. Fewer unpublished photos. Photographers and photo editors see less
       need to reshoot photos, and clearer assignments reduce wasted time
       and effort.
    3. Cost-cutting. Mileage reimbursement checks dropped to $300 a month
       from $350 for photographers at the first paper to adopt the maestro
       concept.
    4. More camaraderie. Teamwork across sections and departments raises
       the respect for each other's contributions to the paper.
    5. Increase in awards. Typically, results can be seen from one year to
       the next where maestro sessions become daily events. The opposite
       also is true: as the number of maestro sessions decline, so do the
       awards.

     -- The Editor's Toolbox: A Reference Guide for Beginners and
     Professionals

     Baylor University Lariot Online student newspaper:

     "There is a maestro concept in journalism, like looking at art,"
     Huett said. "You look at stories and story ideas and then create a
     package."^[48][16]

     Kathy Silverberg, Executive Director of the Times Daily:

     "The writer should have planned strategy with her editor before
     making the call. The Maestro concept works." ^[49][17]

Critiques[50]Edit

   The maestro plan is a cooperative editing plan to change the way
   newsrooms work. Not everyone agrees with the changes that are altering
   newsrooms.

     Reinventing the Newsroom:

                "They're getting involved in all this hokey bullshit
                instead of putting out a hard-hitting newspaper," Schwartz
                contends. "People are getting away from what really moves
                circulation, and that's news, stories that have gut
                appeal."^[51][12]

     American Copy Editors Society, Board Notes:

                "... there's always going to be turmoil in our industry.
                If it's not the maestro concept or pagination, it's
                readers' short attention spans or the Internet. But
                through it all, we - as individual copy editors and the
                group ACES - adapt, grow stronger and get
                better."^[52][18]
