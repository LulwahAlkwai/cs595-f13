How I failed

Six lessons learned.

   This post originally appeared [22]on LinkedIn.

   [23]O'Reilly Media O'Reilly Media When you start out as an
   entrepreneur, it's just you and your idea, or you and your co-founder's
   and your idea. Then you add customers, and they shape and mold you and
   that idea until you achieve the fabled "product-market fit." If you are
   lucky and diligent, you achieve that fit more than once, reinventing
   yourself with multiple products and multiple customer segments.

   But if you are to succeed in building an enduring company, it has to be
   about far more than that: it has to be about the team and the
   institution you create together. As a management team, you aren't just
   working for the company; you have to work on the company, shaping it,
   tuning it, setting the rules that it will live by. And it's way too
   easy to give that latter work short shrift.

   At [24]O'Reilly Media, we've built a successful business and have had a
   big impact on our industry, but looking back at our history, it's also
   clear to me how often we've failed, and what some of the things are
   that kept me, my employees, and our company from achieving our full
   potential. Some of these were failures of vision, some of them were
   failures of nerve, but most of them were failures in building and
   cultivating the company culture.

   What do I mean by culture? Atul Gawande summed it up perfectly in his
   recent New Yorker article [25]Slow Ideas
   . You have a system and a culture when "X is what people do, day in and
   day out, even when no one is watching. `You must' rewards mere
   compliance. Getting to `X is what we do' means establishing X as the
   norm."

   What I got right

   I did a good job setting the guiding star for the company. The company
   goals you've heard from me over the years -- "[26]Work on stuff that
   matters," "[27]Create more value than you capture," "[28]Change the
   world by spreading the knowledge of innovators" -- really have guided
   us. Our principles have been the lodestone that have led us into new
   opportunities and markets.

   We were originally a technical writing consulting firm, but our desire
   to tell the truth about what works and what doesn't (rather than
   telling the story as the product manufacturer wanted it told) led us to
   publish our own books. We wanted those books to be available online, so
   we began working with ebooks all the way back in 1987 -- but influenced
   by the ideals of the free software movement [29]as exemplified by the
   MIT X Consortium, we didn't want those books to be hostage to
   proprietary software or formats, so we worked on standards for
   interoperability (what became [30]Docbook XML) and adopted the
   [31]Viola browser (the first graphical web browser) as a free online
   book reader.

   Working with Viola led us to the web, and we got so excited about it
   that we went out on a limb to include it at the last minute in the book
   we published about the Internet in 1992, [32]The Whole Internet User's
   Guide and Catalog, even though there were only 200 web sites at the
   time. (Mike Loukides, the editor of the book, actually wrote the
   chapter, since there wasn't time for the author, Ed Krol, to make the
   publishing deadline.) The book went on to sell a million copies, and
   the web, well, it went on to become the web.

   Our desire to promote the possibilities of the web also led me into a
   career of [33]advocacy-based marketing, and led us to build the first
   commercial web site, [34]GNN (which we later sold to AOL).

   It was my outrage when no one was paying attention to the free software
   that powered the Internet that led us to launch our conference
   business, starting with the Perl Conference in 1997 (which morphed into
   [35]OSCON, the O'Reilly Open Source Convention), and continuing through
   the years as a platform for advocacy about technologies that matter.
   For example, we created our [36]Web 2.0 events as a way to reignite
   enthusiasm in the tech industry after the dot com bust, and now run
   events both in "hot" areas like data science ([37]Strata) and web
   performance and operations ([38]Velocity), but also in important
   up-and-coming areas like health care ([39]StrataRx) and becoming a
   better manager ([40]Cultivate).

   When Barnes & Noble or Borders returned books to us, stickered and
   unsalable, we didn't pulp them; we sent them to Africa, where they
   could be useful to people who couldn't afford them. We astounded
   publishing competitors in the early 90s with our Unix and X
   Bibliography for bookstores, a marketing piece that included their
   books as well as our own. We wanted to build the market, and so
   highlighted the best books, wherever they came from, not just our own.
   We have followed that same logic in building our digital distribution
   business today, reselling ebooks from other technology publishers from
   oreilly.com as long as they agree to go DRM-free.

   We started [41]Safari Books Online as a joint venture with our biggest
   competitor (who once had an internal group named "The O'Reilly
   Killers") because we believed publishers needed to find new business
   models in an electronic future, and we thought that the models we were
   inventing would be adopted more widely if they included books from
   multiple publishers. We have worked tirelessly on DRM-free ebooks
   because we believe that locking books up in proprietary file formats is
   a path toward a digital dark age.

   Our quest to give voice to new movements and communities led us to
   invest for seven years in [42]Make Magazine and [43]Maker Faire before
   [44]the rest of the world took notice and came to the party. ([45]Maker
   Media was spun out as a separate company at the end of last year.)

   We published books on life-changing diseases as well as life-changing
   technologies ([46]Childhood Leukemia, Childhood Cancer Survivors) until
   the dot com collapse of 2001 led us into drastic retrenchment. We have
   returned to health care with our [47]StrataRx Conference because we
   believe that this is a market in need of disruption, and that there is
   a unique opportunity to apply data both to make the health care system
   more effective and to improve people's lives.

   We've done the same thing with open data in government, advocating the
   idea that [48]government at its best acts as a platform, working to
   bring citizens, civil servants and entrepreneurs together to build new
   ways of solving problems that affect us all. (O'Reilly no longer offers
   our "[49]Gov 2.0" events, but the work continues even more powerfully
   via the nonprofit [50]Code for America.)

   And through all this, we built a profitable group of enterprises
   (O'Reilly Media, Safari Books Online, Maker Media, and [51]O'Reilly
   AlphaTech Ventures) with nearly 500 employees and collective revenues
   approaching $200 million.

   So what's not to like?

   It seems to me that we could have been even more effective (and have
   been working hard over the past decade to become more effective) by
   paying attention to some key management skills.

   In that spirit, here are some reflections on how we failed as an
   organization in the past, and what we have been doing to change that.

   Failure #1: People hear only half the story

   There's a great moment in a Michael Lewis interview that I heard
   recently on NPR. (Unfortunately, I don't have a specific link.) Why,
   Lewis was asked, would anyone in the financial industry talk to him for
   his book [52]The Big Short after the devastating picture of Wall Street
   he'd painted in his first book, [53]Liar's Poker, nearly 20 years
   earlier? You have to understand, Lewis replied (more or less), that
   many of those people got into the financial industry after reading his
   book. Their big takeaway was how easy it was to make a lot of money
   without regard to the niceties of creating much value. He finished with
   the memorable line, "You never know what book you wrote until you know
   what book people read."

   That turned out to be a major problem for me at O'Reilly. I talked so
   much about our ideals, our goal to create more value than we capture,
   to change the world by spreading the knowledge of innovators, that I
   forgot to make sure everyone understood that we were still a business.
   Even when I said things like, "Money in a business is like gas in the
   car. You have to fill the tank, but a road trip is not a tour of gas
   stations," people heard the "road trip is not a tour of gas stations"
   way louder than they heard "you have to fill the tank."

   As a result, we've had countless struggles to have employees take the
   business of the business as seriously as they should. I was always
   pretty good at finding the sweet spot where idealism and business
   reality meet, but I didn't spend enough time teaching that skill to
   everyone on my team. And I didn't check in enough about what people
   were actually hearing when I talked. As Lewis said, "You never know
   what book you wrote until you know what book people read."

   Reflective listening is an important skill. If I were starting O'Reilly
   all over again, I'd spend a lot more time making sure the culture I was
   trying to create was the one that I actually did create. And we're
   working hard today not just to get everyone on the same page, but to
   make sure it's the same page that we think it is!

   Failure #2: "That's how it's done"

   In the early days of the company, I wrote an employee manual that
   reflected my own homegrown HR philosophy, based on the idea that I
   wanted everyone in the company to have the same freedom, initiative,
   and excitement about our work that I did; it opened with this
   statement:

     "I called this booklet `Rules of Thumb' because every rule in it is
     meant to be broken at some time or another, whenever there is good
     reason. We have no absolute policies, just guidelines based on past
     experience. As we grow, we will learn, and will make new empirical
     rules about what works best in new situations."

   It also said things like:

     "Bring yourself to your work! We haven't hired you to act as a cog
     in the company machine, but to exercise your intelligence, your
     creativity, and your perseverance. Make things happen."

   And:

     "Remember, too, that your job isn't just an opportunity to improve
     your economic standing, or that of the company, but to make yourself
     a better person, and this world a little better place to live. Each
     of your co-workers, our customers, our suppliers, and anyone else
     you deal with is a person, just like you. Treat them always with the
     care, fairness, and honesty that you'd like to experience in
     return."

   The only raises we had were merit raises, as you improved your skills
   and impact. You were expected to manage your own time, with no set
   hours, and the only responsibility around vacation time was to make
   sure that no balls got dropped.

   Eventually, I hired an employment lawyer to review my draft, and he
   said, "That's the most inspiring employee manual I've ever read, but I
   can't let you use it."

   I complained, but I eventually gave in. As we grew, it was harder and
   harder to maintain our informal processes. (I remember a real
   inflection point at about 50-60 employees, and another at about 100.)
   We gradually gave up our homegrown way of doing things, and accepted
   normal HR practices -- vacation and sick days, regular reviews, annual
   salary adjustments -- and bit by bit, I let the "HR professionals" take
   over the job of framing and managing the internal culture. That was a
   mistake.

   I've often regretted that I hadn't kept fighting with the lawyers,
   working harder to balance all the legal requirements (many of them
   well-intentioned but designed for a top-down command and control
   culture) with my vision of how a company really ought to work. I
   focused my energy on product, marketing, finance, and strategy, and
   didn't put enough time in to make sure I was building the organization
   I wanted.

   Reading recently about the [54]HR practices at Valve and [55]Github, so
   reminiscent of early O'Reilly, I'm struck by the need to redefine how
   organizations work in the 21st century. I'm not saying that Valve or
   GitHub's approach is for everyone, but they indicate a deep engagement
   with the problem space, and fresh approaches to the questions of how to
   manage an organization. [56]Google's People Analytics may be a more
   scalable application of new HR thinking to a company of serious size.

   The point is that while there's a lot of accumulated wisdom in how to
   run a company, there's a lot still to be invented, and you should bring
   the same entrepreneurial energy to improving the culture as you do to
   improving the product or your approach to the market.

   That, by the way, is one of the reasons I'm excited about our new
   [57]Cultivate Conference. It focuses on how important it is to build
   leadership skills, not just tech skills. I'm hopeful that we can bring
   together leaders (and aspiring leaders) at technology companies to
   learn from each other, and come away inspired to build organizations
   that don't just succeed in the marketplace, but are excellent places to
   work, have a positive impact on the world, and bring out the best in
   everyone they touch.

   Failure #3: Cash and control

   In today's venture-capital-fueled market of "build it and see if they
   will come," it's often hard to remember that there are businesses built
   without investors, funded by revenue from real customers. I never took
   VC money because in my early days as a tech-writing consultant, I saw
   lots of companies go from being great places to work to being just
   another company, and I wanted to keep control of what I did and did not
   do.

   I wanted control, but I missed one of the most powerful ways to have
   it.

   Bill Janeway is the author of the outstanding book [58]Doing Capitalism
   in the Internet Economy. In it, he recounts the lesson of one of his
   own mentors, Fred Adler, "Happiness is positive cash flow," and talks
   about his working principle of "Cash and Control": "assured access to
   sufficient cash in time of crisis to buy the time needed to understand
   the unanticipated, and sufficient control to use the time effectively."

   (I first met Bill in 1995 when Warburg Pincus -- and a lot of other
   venture capitalists -- came to look at GNN. Bill won my enduring
   affection with his honest advice after our lunch: "I don't think you
   want our money. You'd come to hate us. You have different goals than we
   do." Bill is now a member of O'Reilly's board -- I believe the only
   time he's taken a board seat in a company he didn't fund.)

   I came to learn the truth of Bill's statement about cash and control in
   the 90s. Publishing is a fairly cash-intensive business. You pay
   advances to authors -- many of whom never come through with the books
   they promised to write, or take way longer to complete them -- and as
   your editorial, design, and production teams work hand in hand with the
   author, you may have years of investment before you see a penny back.
   And in the old days, before ebooks and print-on-demand, you then had to
   invest tens of thousands of dollars in inventory costs for each book.

   O'Reilly was like a leaky bucket. We were always profitable on a P&L
   basis, but we never had enough cash. And as our publishing business
   accelerated through the 90s, we needed more and more of it. We borrowed
   against our receivables and our inventory, juggled payables till our
   CFO was blue in the face, but we ended up funding our growth through a
   variety of equity exits from companies we'd spun out and sold, like
   GNN, or invested in, like [59]Blogger (Pyra Labs), former O'Reilly
   employee Evan Williams' first company.

   We'd sold GNN to AOL for what seemed at the time the princely sum of
   $15 million, much of it in stock. We were locked up for a couple of
   years, but because of our pressing cash needs, we had to sell our stock
   as soon as it became available, netting $30 or $40 million because of
   the increase in AOL's value as the Internet bubble inflated. That was a
   nice win, but if we'd had the leisure to hold on till the peak, our
   stock would have been worth $1 billion, and even if we hadn't timed
   things perfectly, several hundred million.

   Where the shit really hit the fan was after the dot com bust of 2001.
   We were seriously in debt again, our business was in free fall
   (shrinking by 30% over the next three years before rebuilding), our
   banks pulled our loans and nearly put us out of business. (Banks are
   fond of lending you money when you are doing well, but watch out
   whenever you're in trouble! They are the first to the exits.)

   I still remember the day I had to decide which employees to cut in our
   first-ever layoffs. As I pored over the worksheets, I noticed hair all
   over my papers; I was so stressed that my hair was falling out.

   What was sad was that it didn't need to be that way.

   In the depths of the crisis, we hired a new CFO (Laura Baldwin, now
   president and COO), who instituted new financial controls and
   discipline. She renegotiated contracts with suppliers. She ruthlessly
   cut non-performing titles, freeing up the cash from inventory. And she
   was the one who persuaded me to do the layoffs rather than going down
   with the ship and all hands.

   The difference was enormous. We rebuilt O'Reilly's revenues and profits
   through successful new books and conferences, the growth of Safari
   Books Online (which we'd launched right in the middle of the crisis),
   Maker Media, and other new businesses. But the biggest impact may well
   have been the one that Laura had -- on our cash.

   Let me put it this way: during the 90s, our average revenue per title
   from publishing was more than $250,000. After the bust, it slipped to
   less than $100,000 and never recovered. Yet during the 90s, we were
   always bleeding cash, while since the bust, we have put tens of
   millions of dollars in the bank through positive cash flow. That has
   given us money to invest in new ventures and business transformation as
   the world continues to change around us.

   There are four lessons here:
    1. Financial discipline matters. It really matters. If you're a
       venture-backed startup, financial discipline gives you more control
       over when you have to go out for that next round. If you're
       self-funded, financial discipline lets you invest in what's
       important in your business. So many companies agonize over the
       quality of their product, and work tirelessly to build their brand,
       yet pay the barest attention to their financials. Money is the
       lifeblood of your business. Take it seriously. You have to get good
       at managing it.
    2. Treat your financial team as co-founders. They aren't just bean
       counters. They can make the difference between success and failure.
       Don't just look for rockstar developers or designers, look for a
       rockstar CFO. Hire someone who is better than you are, who can be a
       real partner in growing the business. Before Laura came on board, I
       was always the most numerate person in the organization, the one
       with the most sensitive finger on the pulse of our financials. (I
       would often tell our previous CFO, "Those numbers look wrong --
       check them!" I had so internalized the ratios and average monthly
       spending by category that I knew immediately when something was out
       of line.) Even if you're a good entrepreneur with a nose for where
       money intersects your vision, a first-class financial team focused
       on building effective controls, managing expenses, and optimizing
       the system will be well worth it.
    3. Hold teams accountable for their numbers. Every manager -- in fact,
       every employee -- needs to understand the financial side of the
       business. One of my big mistakes was to let people build products,
       or do marketing, without forcing them to understand the financial
       impact of their decisions. This is flying blind -- like turning
       them loose in an automobile without a speedometer or a fuel gauge.
       Anyone running a group with major financial impact should have
       their P&L tattooed on their brain, able to answer questions on
       demand, or within a few moments. It isn't someone else's job to pay
       attention. Financial literacy doesn't come naturally to everyone.
       Make sure it's part of your employee training package, and make
       sure that people running important business functions are held
       accountable for their numbers.
    4. Run lean; reinvent tirelessly. After the bust, we laid off 20% of
       our staff, and while we missed many of them intensely on a personal
       level, as a business, we didn't skip a beat. So many people were
       doing things that just didn't need doing! Maybe those things had
       once been necessary but had outlived their usefulness, but many of
       them were just cruft that had accumulated in the organization.
       The [60]Lean Startup methodology emphasizes measurement in quest of
       product-market fit, describing a startup as "a machine for
       learning." This is great. But you need to turn these measurements
       not just outward on the market but inward on your organization.
       What is the impact of each activity? Who could be repurposed toward
       something with greater impact? Does this job really need doing? Can
       it be done more efficiently and effectively? (For more on this
       topic, see my previous post, [61]Linking Mission to Strategy and
       Action.)

   Failure #4: Tolerating mediocrity

   There was another lesson that we learned from those 2001 layoffs. While
   most of the people we laid off were great employees who went on to find
   good jobs elsewhere, we were appalled to discover there were some
   people who had built themselves a nice, cozy position but weren't
   working very hard. While most of us were pulling the wagon, they were
   simply riding on it. We even discovered several cases of fraud! That
   goes back to my point above about the importance of a crack financial
   team -- one of their key jobs is to have strong controls in place. I
   would never have believed that one of my employees would do that. It
   can happen to any company. The longer you are in business, the more
   outrageous things you will have employees do on your watch!

   Looking back, I had an extremely naive view: everyone was inspired by
   the same motivations as I was, passionate about their work and the
   impact that we were having. They loved their jobs and wanted to be
   great at them.

   If you want that to be true, you can't just believe it; you have to
   work at it! You need a real emphasis on hiring, training and mentorship
   -- and firing! Every manager in the company has to be an expert on his
   or her staff -- what makes them tick -- and as focused on finding
   "employee-company fit" as the product and marketing team are in finding
   product-market fit. And HR can't just be the complaint department. It
   needs to be an active partner in talent acquisition, culture, and
   leadership development.

   When someone isn't right for the job, it's easy to shrink from the
   confrontation of telling them so, or to accept 60% or 70% of what you
   wanted because you think you can't afford the time and trouble to find
   a replacement. You aren't doing anyone any favors. An employee who is
   not performing at 100% is as aware as you are of that fact, and most
   likely isn't happy about it. Having the courage to ask them to move on
   is an essential management skill. (It doesn't even have to be firing;
   it can be coaching them to make the decision on their own.)

   Looking back, I wish we'd worked harder early on to build an
   organization in which human potential isn't just expected and taken for
   granted, but is also nurtured -- if necessary, with tough love. So many
   times I knew that someone was doing less than we had a right to expect,
   but I'd let their manager protect them. I didn't have the guts to keep
   working the issue till we understood what to do and took appropriate
   action. We ended up building a culture where managers too often
   compensated for the failings of employees by working around them,
   either working harder themselves, hiring someone else to fill in the
   gaps, or just letting the organization be less effective. We're doing
   much better today, but we still have a long way to go.

   So, if you have a bad feeling about the role someone is playing in your
   organization, work the issue until you feel right about it. Take
   management seriously!

   The same lesson applies on the product and marketing side. I never
   regretted raising the bar -- sending a book back for more work at the
   last minute, even though the author and editor thought it was done (in
   the early days, I used to read every O'Reilly book), deciding that the
   hotel the team had selected for the first Perl Conference was too cheap
   and didn't set the right tone, and we had to move to another one -- but
   I look back at the many times I let something go by that I shouldn't
   have because the team would be upset, and I regret every one of them.
   You can be uncompromising without being a jerk. I sometimes wish I'd
   channeled my inner Steve Jobs a little more often.

   Those moments of giving in to convenience -- the schedule is already in
   place, it's too late to make a change, we've already announced the
   product (or worse, released it!), the ad is already running --
   gradually wear away at a company's greatness.

   At the same time, you can't have random drive-by corrections by
   management. There needs to be a culture that aspires to greatness, but
   also understands that that is the result of a disciplined process of
   setting and achieving expectations, not just waiting for inspiration to
   strike.

   Failure #5: Hiring supplements, not complements

   Another of the things I wish I'd done earlier was to hire people who
   were good at things I wasn't. As a founder, you often seem to be the
   best at everything -- the best product designer, the best marketer, the
   best sales person. Sometimes that's really true, but often it's just
   because you hire people who aren't as good as you are at the things
   you're good at, and don't hire people who are better than you are at
   the things you don't do so well. You hire supplements to do more of
   what you already do, rather than people who really complement your
   skills.

   I already mentioned how I went through the first 20 years of my
   company's life without hiring someone who was better on the financial
   side than I was. We didn't build a sales and marketing culture either
   -- it was foreign to our idea of who we were. We were product driven,
   idea driven, and while we developed a unique and powerful style of
   activism-driven marketing, we never developed the kind of analytical
   marketing discipline that someone like Alistair Croll describes so well
   in his book [62]Lean Analytics. And as for sales, that felt a little
   dirty to many of our employees.

   In the past few years, we've worked hard to change that. Laura has led
   a successful effort to develop that analytical marketing competency and
   to add sales thinking to the company DNA. We now have sales training
   for anyone who has customer contact. We've built a team to focus on
   sponsorship sales for our events, more than doubling our yield and
   vastly improving the profitability of our events.

   Failure #6: I'll take care of that

   I believe it was [63]Harold Geneen who once said, "The skill of
   management is to achieve your objectives through the efforts of
   others." Yet, like so many entrepreneurs, my first instinct was not to
   hire the team to go after a new product or market, but to do it myself,
   or with the team I already had.

   Some of that was a byproduct of being a scrappy, self-funded
   organization, where the existing team tries new things and hires only
   after it's clear there's really an opportunity there. It's great when
   your management team leads from the front. But overall, we took it too
   far and didn't build a strong enough culture of deliberate hiring to go
   after new opportunities.

   O'Reilly always grew organically. That has a real charm, and accounts
   for many of the things people love about the company. But a company
   needs business discipline, identifying strategic goals, then investing
   and hiring to achieve those goals, just as much as it needs product,
   marketing, sales, financial, and employee cultivation discipline. While
   our ideals are what define us, combining those ideals with a
   results-oriented business culture is how we have continued to thrive.

   Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss wrote in his book [64]The Savage
   Mind about the difference between the bricoleur (handyman) and the
   engineer. The handyman makes do with what he has to hand. The engineer
   thinks more abstractly, figures out what he or she needs, and acquires
   it before beginning work. I was always a bricoleur. As we go forward, I
   aspire to be more of an engineer. Although it's good to remember that,
   as Marc Hedlund, former SVP of product development & engineering at
   Etsy, remarked, "People and code are...different. The approaches that
   work so well for getting new software to run are not directly
   applicable to getting people to work well together."

       What happened with the 2009 layoffs when the banks cut off your
       lines of credit again?

               o Guest
                 Why'd you suddenly have to lay off 14% of your staff
                 then?
                    # Jay R
                      Let me guess, Guest. You're one of the 14%, right?
                      Maybe he was putting the things he wrote about into
                      practice and removing those who were not
                      contributing?
                         @ http://radar.oreilly.com timoreilly
                           Jay, I'd bet you are right on your first guess,
                           but the second point is a bit harsh. Pruning
                           parts of the business that are not working
                           doesn't necessarily reflect on the people
                           involved. Sure, sometimes it does, but often,
                           the business idea just didn't work, just as a
                           lot of startups fail, and that isn't seen as a
                           negative reflection on those who were part of
                           them. Many of them go on to great success. So
                           it's important to separate the
                           business/financial side from the personal
                           performance side.

                      We did shutter some non-performing businesses during
                      the 2009 downturn. We did not lay off 14% of the
                      staff. And we were not forced to, as we were in
                      2001. We were using the opportunity to increase our
                      focus on what was working.

                         @ http://radar.oreilly.com timoreilly
                           No, that's probably about right. I didn't
                           remember it being 14% but if that's what we
                           said at the time, it may well have been. But I
                           really don't see that as being in the same
                           category as our 2001 layoffs, which were truly
                           forced winnowing, with our continued existence
                           in doubt.
                           Our 2009 layoffs consisted of closing down
                           businesses in which we didn't make any money,
                           and in which we didn't see any future prospect
                           of making money. My point is that we were being
                           prudent in the face of the downturn; we have
                           stopped various other businesses since. Any
                           good business does this, on an ongoing basis.
                           I will say that I do regret that we weren't
                           able to make a go of some of those businesses.
                           In many cases, if we had let go of some people
                           earlier through better performance management,
                           we might have saved the broader business unit.
                           We had a constant struggle in the past at
                           O'Reilly to get some of our business units to
                           take the business itself seriously. They are so
                           mission driven that they forget that someone
                           has to pay the bills. I think we're getting
                           much better at managing that, but even now, we
                           still have some hiccups.
                           It would be easy to blame some of the people
                           involved. I'd rather blame myself, as I have
                           done in this piece. As Harold Geneen said,
                           "Management must manage."
                           What we did in 2009 was just that.

       Thanks Tim. A lot of this resonates, even for those of us very
       early in our entrepreneurial journey. It seems, though, that there
       is sometimes more value in experiencing a "mistake" rather than
       avoiding it altogether. In other words, the act of failing -- and
       the intimate learning that comes through that process- sends us on
       a path of success that might never have otherwise been achieved.
       This is at least what I tell myself when I screw up.

            guess. We can't really eliminate mistakes, just peel back and

       Well, I don't know. Yes, you've learned valuable lessons, but
       perhaps you were a company that people loved precisely because you
       didn't know all those things up front. There were things that were
       more important to you than just the bottom line. Perhaps if you had
       a really serious, efficient CFO at the beginning your financials
       would have been better and the world would have been worse off. You
       might not have put out a book on every obscure Unix tool; perhaps
       Maker Faire would have been seen as too much of a gamble. Perhaps
       fewer people would be employed and there would be more dollars for
       you and fewer dollars for some of the less competent people who
       used to work for you. How much efficiency do we really need? Enough
       to sustain a business, yes. But I see too many companies with good
       products, a good culture and happy customers ruin themselves
       because of the imperative from investors to grow, grow, grow.
          + http://radar.oreilly.com timoreilly
            I hear you, Joe. But we've continued to do those things even
            as we have become more disciplined. There is no question,
            though, that a lot of our success did indeed come from our
            ignorance of "how things are done." But I believe it's
            possible to have a deep connection to your values and mission
            while still running a tight ship. The pathology you describe
            is common - putting growth or profit before all else - but I
            can assure you that O'Reilly is a long way off from that being
            a problem. We are still dreamers who want to make a better
            world. We just know that we can do that more effectively if we
            do our dreaming in a disciplined way.
               o Robin de Jongh
                 A lot of interesting points. On this one you made about
                 structured dreaming though - I suspect habitual dreamers
                 will tell you it is impossible to dream in a structured
                 way. How do you catch a cloud and pin it down? From a
                 business perspective, growing into a large company is
                 impossible to do while keeping the dreaming alive, and
                 there is overwhelming evidence that this is the case for
                 all companies that grow beyond a certain size. I also
                 suspect that this is true of O'reilly (the company).
                 However, if this creative culture is what you really
                 still want to have; if these dreams are whom you really
                 wish to cultivate; splitting the monolith into smaller
                 startup-like units is perhaps the best and only option
                 you have. I suspect this is what you did with Make. Allow
                 each unit to be able to innovate, and the way to do that
                 is to allow each to have the potential to fail or succeed
                 big. Management of all forms inhibits the right to fail.
                 In my experience the right to fail is the key to
                 innovation. Dreams are the private property of individual
                 employees, and the only way to have them give over those
                 dreams to the collective is to provide a seed bed... to
                 cultivate and not to manage.

       This was really helpful as I am on the other side of the mountain
       from you having yet to reach the top. It's great to have your
       hindsight. We too have similar HR policies to the ones you
       abandoned - nice to hear your perspective there. I sometimes feel
       the pain of spending on finance and accounting, but am quickly
       learning that financial controls and knowledge of the numbers is
       critical to success. You offered great reinforcement for that
       investment.
       I do have one question. What motivated you to write this particular
       piece at this time?
     * AWSOMEDEVSIGNER
       This was a real eye-opener Tim, thank you! I am as euphoric and
       idealistic the same way you was (and hopefully still are, even if
       you lost hair) regarding the HR policies you published some years
       ago. It is the real way to go combined with a healthy way of
       implementing the principle "Happiness is positive cash flow." (this
       statement is packed with wisdom). People can love their work and be
       aware of their financial responsibilities at the same time. It is
       the moment when people really realize who else depends on their
       work. Not only the company, but colleagues and their families (of
       course their own families as well). Children are the creative minds
       of tomorrow and the next tax payers in line. Regarding venture
       capital and investors I strongly agree with @JoeBuck:disqus .

       Seems to me that your success is in fact the result of your

       difficult to know if one would have achieved such success. Great
       article, thanks!
     * Derek Douville
       Some of the best management career advice I ever received was to
       focus on emulating success, but move on quickly from failures. In
       essence, there are finite ways to succeed and unlimited ways to
       fail. As long as your failures can lead to a successful outcome,
       you are then able to focus only on using the successful experiences
       as a template for more predictable outcomes. One example would be
       during a hiring phase, to find candidates that are a good talent
       fit, understand why your top performers are great talent fits and
       then look for those elements in the interview.

       Did you really fail? You published tons of great books. I saw and

       Publishing is not an easy business. You set up so many new things,
       you influenced so many persons and finally you still seems to be
       active in the area. Well maybe you'll consider my opinion as part

     * Sxeptomaniac
       Not enough leaders take time to reflect on the past and try to
       improve for the future. I guess that's one of the reasons I enjoy
       reading Tim O'Reilly's writings.
       Take a look at Microsoft. It's become a debacle of a company,
       squandering their industry leads on successful products, missing
       great opportunities for new products, etc. I hear far more stories
       about what a terrible environment it is to work in, than anything
       else. The leadership takes no time to reflect on what about their
       company helps them succeed, and what is leading them towards
       failure. As a result, they simply are barreling ahead on
       auto-pilot.
     * Jerry Rocteur
       Bravo!
     * Bruce E
       Hi Tim - I enjoyed the article and am glad to hear O'Reilly is
       thriving. I think often and fondly of my time at O'Reilly, even if
       in the end it was not the right fit. I'll never forget how nice and
       welcoming you were to my kids when we visited during Foo Camp,
       which I truly appreciated.
       To those who don't know Tim personally, he is one of the most
       genuinely nice people you will ever meet. Which is not to say I
       think he did everything right...frankly, I disagreed with quite a
       few things.
       I won't go into them here, but I remember one interaction because
       it seemed so out of character for Tim. He said to me, "Bruce...at
       some point, you're just going to have to accept that this is an
       employer-employee relationship" (in the sense that the issue we
       were discussing was no longer up for debate).
       I think one thing that fails to come through in the article is how
       much Tim hates to play the heavy (although I'm sure he has evolved
       in the last 10 years, as he highlights the many ways he has become
       a tougher manager/businessman).
       On paper, O'Reilly should have been the perfect home for me. I
       thought I was joining a tech company, when in fact I was joining a
       publishing company. I was just too MIT-ish in a company that was
       more Harvard-ish.
       The fact that I wasn't right for the role or the company culture
       was both a surprise and a real disappointment. We both would have
       been better off if we had come to that realization sooner, or acted
       on it immediately.
       I think in the end, the best we could hope for was to part ways
       amicably, and I'm glad to this day for the time Tim spent while I
       worked there.
       Good luck to everyone.
       Cheers
       Bruce E.

            Thanks, Bruce. I like your comment that O'Reilly is a bit more
            Harvard than MIT, which surprises many people (though it
            shouldn't.)
            Regarding the one interaction you cite, I'd forgotten it until
            you brought it up. But it highlights an important point in any
            organization. There should be lots of room for everyone to
            speak up, but at some point, it's essential to come to closure
            and move on.
            I really enjoyed working with you too, and in the end, I think
            the things that didn't work out during your tenure had far
            more to do with external industry trends than with either of
            us!

       Awesome article and there is lots of valuable wisdom in here.
       Sadly, much like trying to explain things to a teenager, many of it
       will go over the head of most people. Unless you have been in your
       position they just can't relate. Even though I only briefly dabbled
       with running my own company in my early 20's, I recognize every one
       of your points (and realized, especially at the time, I was in over
       my head and moved on). The cash flow one in particular appears to
       continually be a really hard one for people who have only ever
       received a pay check to completely grasp. I'll be sharing this with
       many others. Thanks!

       Appreciate the article, Tim, and the insight into practical
       business management and cultivation.
