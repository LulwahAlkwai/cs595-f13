   What's This?
   Ios7
   [47]Samanthamurphy
   By Samantha Murphy Kelly2013-09-17 18:42:52 UTC

   Apple is [48]launching its iOS 7 software on Wednesday, and if we've
   learned anything from major system updates in the past, there [49]will
   be kinks.

   Before you download the new software -- which will be pushed to iOS
   users sometime during the day (we got the iOS 6 notification on our
   devices around lunchtime last year on the East Coast) -- there are a
   few simple things to do ahead of time in case there are bugs. The last
   thing you'd want is to have your pictures, music and other files wiped
   along the way.

   SEE ALSO: [50]Hands On With iOS 7: It's Just the Beginning

   To download iOS 7 worry-free, the first step is to back up your data
   via iCloud. Apple actually backs up the most important data (if using
   iOS 5 or later) automatically, but the feature has to be enabled. To
   set this up, visit Settings > iCloud > Backup & Storage. This will back
   up your iPhone on a daily basis as long as the device's screen is
   locked, on a Wi-Fi network and connected to power.

   But before you download iOS, we suggest doing a manual back up. To do
   so, follow the same steps as above (Settings > iCloud > Backup &
   Storage) and then click "Back Up Now."

                                  [51]Apple

   It will take a bit of time to do a full backup, so just sit tight in
   the meantime. For those with a ton of data you might not be able to
   complete the backup -- you'll have to either transfer files (photos,
   etc.) via an Apple connector to a computer, delete a few apps you
   haven't used in awhile, or make room elsewhere.

   You'll probably run into the same issue when trying to update iOS 7 if
   your device is near storage capacity, so you might want to clean house
   now.

                                  [52]Apple

   Another area worth backing up is your iTunes library. Connect your
   device to a computer to sync with iTunes, but note this might be
   disabled if you have iCloud backup turned on. RIght-click the device in
   iTunes under Devices and select Back Up. You can also back it up by
   clicking the file menu and select Devices > Back Up.

   Will you be downloading iOS 7 when it launches or will you be waiting
   until possible bugs are updated? Let us know in the comments below.

Hands On With iOS 7

    1. Ios7-1

Starting Up
       From the moment iOS 7 loads, its clear this is different. The linen
       that infused iOS 5 and iOS 6 is gone, replaced with white and thin
       sans serif typography.
    2. Ios7-2

A Splash of Color
       While white is a predominant theme in iOS 7, this is not a
       monochrome OS. Color accents are almost always visible.
    3. Ios7-3

The New Home Screen
       For the first time since the original iPhone, the overall look and
       icon structure of iOS is now new and fresh.
       The wallpaper can now be dynamic or static. Dynamic wallpaper is
       similar to the animated wallpaper in Android, except it doesn't
       interact with your finger. The default wallpaper is static.
    4. Ios7-4

A Cleaner Inbox
       Mail has received a full revamp to both its main view and the
       compose screen.
    5. Ios7-5

New Integrated Services
       Flickr and Vimeo join Facebook and Twitter as built-in services.
    6. Ios7-6

Folders and Control Center
       Swiping up from the bottom brings up the Control Center. This is an
       easy way to access your most used settings, including WiFi, audio,
       brightness and quick access to alarm, a calculator, camera and
       flashlight.
       Meanwhile, photos can now store more items and span pages.
    7. Ios7-7

Camera Options
       The new camera interface has a number of options built-in. Swiping
       across the bottom brings up options for the standard camera or the
       video camera.
    8. Ios7-8

Instagram Friendly
       There is a new square mode on the camera, perfect for Instagram.
       The panorama mode is still here too.
    9. Ios7-9

Houston We Have Filters
       Apple also has its own filters built-into iOS 7. Rather than simply
       applying a filter in post, these filters are actually real-time and
       you can look through the viewfinder in that filter before taking a
       shot.
   10. Ios7-10

Stocks and Notes
       The Stocks app looks totally fresh. Notes also has a new coat of
       paint. The texture is still there but the yellow lined paper and
       Marker Felt are a thing of the past.
   11. Ios7-11

iTunes and Wish Lists
       iTunes and the App Store both have new designs. Additionally, Apple
       has introduced a new Wish List feature on mobile, making it easy
       for users to save an app to buy later.
   12. Ios7-12

App Store
       The App Store structure is still the same but the look is more
       fresh. In addition to the general charts, users can also check to
       see what apps are popular in their area.
   13. Ios7-13

Sharing Or Adding to a Wishlist
       A new share button shows off what you can do with an app which
       includes AirDrop and adding it to a wishlist.
   14. Ios7-14

Passbook and News Stand
       Both look fresh.
   15. Ios7-15

Lock Screen
       The Lock screen no longer has anything to slide to unlock, just
       swipe to the right.
       You can choose to make Control Center available at the lock screen
       or not.
   16. Ios7-32

Notifications and Weather
       Pulling down from the top still brings up notifications, only now
       without linen and with a history.
       The weather app is beautiful and animated.
   17. Ios7-16

Reminders
       Reminders is now more robust in its appearance. There are different
       groups of reminders, not just lists.
       The new reminder screen also has a refined look. It still has
       texture, but the lines are less bold.
   18. Ios7-17

Compass
       The compass looks totally new and totally great.
   19. Ios7-18

Switching Apps
       Double tapping home brings up full screen previews of various apps.
       Scroll back and forth and see previews of your apps in real-time.
       Some might say this is copying Window Phone, but really, this look
       was pioneered by Palm with the late, great, webOS.
   20. Ios7-19

Dialer and Messages
       The dialer and the iMessage interface follow the new trends of
       being bright and with lots fo color.
   21. Ios7-20

Notifications
       Notifications pop-up in dark now, not white.
   22. Ios7-30

Calendar
       The calendar is de-leathered and has a very Google+ look.
   23. Ios7-31

Calendar Inbox
       The calendar gets a proper inbox for incoming invitations.
   24. Ios7-21

Maps
       Apple Maps has toned down some of its textures but the basic app
       looks very similar.
   25. Ios7-22

Directions
       The directions page in Maps has been rebuilt and it looks much more
       sleek.
   26. Ios7-23

Calculator and Clock
       The calculator still pays homage to the great HP calculators of the
       70s, but with fewer bevels.
       As for the clock, gone is that patent-infringing world clock look.
   27. Ios7-24

Alarms and Stopwatch
       Check out the 3D effect when picking a time.
   28. Ios7-25

Timer and Settings
       The timer is totally new too. This is what one of the standard
       settings pages looks like.
   29. Ios7-26

Safari
       The bookmarks section for Safari is texture free but full of color.
       The search and URL omnibox makes a glorious return (it was
       separated with iOS 3 back in 2009).
       The whole look of this browser would look equally at home at
       Mountain View as it does in Cupertino.
   30. Ios7-27

Searching and Loading a Page
       Typing in a URL or string of text offers up real-time suggestions
       for an address or search query.
       The thin bar at the top of the screen indicates page load progress.
   31. Ios7-28

Tabs
       It's like Cover Flow, but vertical!
   32. Ios7-29

FaceTime Audio
       FaceTime can now do audio calls!
