   Corey Husic, a student and trained Climate Presenter, is sending the
   message below to Joseph Bast, President and CEO, Heartland Institute.
   Sign our petition and join Corey in standing up for reality. Say NO to
   climate denial in our schools.

   Check out some of our recent campaign coverage from the [4]National
   Wildlife Federation, [5]Grist, [6]The New York Times, [7]Living Green
   Magazine, and [8]Renewable Energy World.com.

   Dear Mr. Bast,

   I'm Corey Husic, and I'm a high school student in Pennsylvania. It's
   come to my attention that you are prepared to spend a significant
   amount of money on a "global warming curriculum" to teach kids that
   climate change isn't real.

   That's right. According to your own budget documents, you want to hand
   teachers a curriculum that says global warming is "a major scientific
   controversy" and that carbon dioxide might not even be a pollutant.

   Please be advised: Your entire premise is false. The reality is that
   our climate is changing now and human activities are a primary cause.
   I'm just a high school student, so please don't take my word for it.
   Just ask any National Academy of Science in the world or just about any
   actual climate scientist.

   Given who pays your bills, your plan doesn't come as a surprise.
   According to your own documents, your organization is funded by coal
   and oil companies with a financial stake in denying climate science --
   not to mention tobacco companies that tried to convince us smoking
   doesn't cause cancer.

   My generation is already experiencing a very different climate from our
   parents and grandparents. We will be the ones responsible for making
   sure coastal cities are able to withstand rising sea levels. We are the
   ones who will have to protect ourselves from weather extremes like
   stronger hurricanes, longer droughts and hotter heat waves. Instead of
   trying to undermine the science that shows humans are causing climate
   change, we should be learning how those changes are going to affect us
   and what we can do about it. In other words, teach us something useful.

   We respectfully demand that you cease and desist your effort to bring
   climate change denial into our schools.
