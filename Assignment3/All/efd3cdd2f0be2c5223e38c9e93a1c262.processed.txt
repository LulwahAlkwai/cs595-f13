[120]Holy haemorrhage Batman! Wind turbines burst bat lungs

   by Ed Yong

   [121]Blogging on Peer-Reviewed Research Conservationists often object
   to wind farms because of the possibility that they could kill birds.
   But birds aren't the only flying animals to be taken out by turbines -
   it turns out that bats often lose their lives too, and not in quite the
   way you might imagine.

   Recently, scientists have [122]noticed a large number of dead bats at
   wind farms around the world. The turbines seem to be taking a
   particularly heavy toll on migratory species and while it was clear
   that the scale of these deaths is much larger than expected, it's less
   clear why they're happening at all.

   Bats can fly through pitch-darkness through echolocation - a superb
   biological sonar system that's particularly good at detecting moving
   objects. With such state-of-the-art equipment, it's difficult to
   believe that these accomplished aeronauts could simply be blundering
   into the spinning blades. Now, Erin Baerwald and colleagues at the
   University of Calgary think that they have found the mystery killer,
   and it's one that is invisible to the bats' sonar - areas of low
   pressure.

   As the blades of wind turbines spin, they reduce the pressure of the
   air around them. As bats fly into these low-pressure zones, the sudden
   change causes the air in their lungs to expand faster than the bats can
   exhale. The technical term is "pulmonary barotrauma". In three
   syllables, "their lungs burst". Areas of low pressure are essentially
   invisible - even if the bats' sophisticated sonar guides them through
   the spinning blades, they wouldn't be able to sense these danger zones
   until it's too late.

   Windturbine.jpg

   CSI Alberta

   Baerwald performed autopsies on 188 hoary and silver-haired bats
   recovered from a wind farm in Alberta, Canada, to determine their cause
   of death. She found that 90% of them had some form of internal bleeding
   in their chest cavity that is consistent with death by decompression. A
   thorough dissection confirmed Baerwald's interpretation - the majority
   had damaged lungs and some had distinct air-filled bubbles that were
   formed by the rupture of their alveolae (the tiny sacs in the lungs
   through which gases are exchanged with the blood).

   It's not clear what extent of pressure drop would be fatal to a flying
   bat, but based on the speed of modern turbines, Baerwald calculated
   that their tips create a fall in pressure of 5-10 kPA (kilopascals).
   That's more than enough to seriously harm a lot of mammals and rats
   cannot withstand even a drop of 4.4 kPa.

   About a third of the bats killed by barotraumas also suffered from
   external injuries, picked up by hitting the blades themselves. It's
   likely that these animals stumbled into the turbines after suffering
   from internal injuries, for only 8% of them - just 6 animals in total -
   had died from external injuries with no accompanying internal ones.

   Birds and bats

   Pipistrelle.jpg It's possible that the scale of bat fatalities has
   simply been underestimated in previous studies, which were primarily
   designed to look for dead birds. Birds are less often killed by wind
   turbines and Baerwald thinks that their unique breathing apparatus may
   make them less vulnerable to sudden pressure drops than those of bats.
   Bat flight is fuelled by large lungs and hearts, oxygen-rich blood and
   an unusually thin layer separating the gas in their lungs from the
   blood in their vessels.

   In contrast, the lungs of birds are more rigid. Unlike the balloon-like
   sacs of mammals, those of birds are tube-like, compact and have
   exceptionally strong capillaries. In low-pressure zones that would pop
   the lungs of bats, those of birds barely expand. It's a case of the
   robin outclassing the bat. Birds do however have a relative
   disadvantage; they lack the sonar of bats (most species anyway), so
   most of their turbine-related fatalities are caused by direct hits.

   As wind turbines become more common, one group of scientists predict
   that by 2020, they will kill anywhere from 33,000 to 110,000 bats per
   year.  That isn't a reason to cease the development of wind technology,
   but it is a reason to think about ways of protecting passing bats.
   Situating wind farms away from migration routes is one possible
   solution, although these routes aren't exactly thoroughly mapped out.
   Shut-off times for turbines during periods of high bat activity is
   another, although that would slash their electricity production.

   Whatever the solution, it's heartening to see that the issue is at
   least being taken seriously. After all Baerwald's research has an
   intriguing blend of funders - three conservation organisations, such as
   Bat Conservation International and five energy providers, including
   Shell Canada.

       Part of the reason they're flying through the low pressure zones
       caused by the passing fan blade is that they cant see it, they use
       sonar. This allows them to fly incredibly close to the fans with
       confidence. Use the sonar which steers them close to the fans to
       steer them away from it. Either some sort of sonic pulse which is
       sent at a high frequency to annoy the bats (but not mess up their
       echolocation) or some other form of sound which would keep them
       away from the fans.

       Bats cannot `see' a rapidly moving object that comes out from
       hiding, which is why it's easy to hit a bat with a long stick.

       "it's easy to hit a bat with a long stick."
       A long stick. You mean a bat? :-)
       It's disturbing that you know this.

       "some sort of sonic pulse which is sent at a high frequency to
       annoy the bats"
       A sonic pulse. You mean a bat signal? (This is too easy - I'm
       stopping now).

       Fortunately, it has also been discovered that bats avoid radar
       stations. There are already suggestions to scare bats away from
       wind farms with radar systems (citation:
       [123]http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.po
       ne.0000297 ).

       I love to watch bats as they come out at night, so the
       windmills-killing-bats stories always attract my attention. It's
       good to know that the reason had been found. Now I can lay my
       rather idiotic armchair speculations about small internal parts
       looking like bugs to rest.
       Also, it seems unfortunate that the new data doesn't seem to give
       any new ideas about how to mitigate it. Keep us posted on that.

       Easy problem to fix, just make some sort of wind turbine out of
       bats themselves, I'm not much of a scietnist but blue peter has
       taught me a little bit of cellotape and PVC glue goes along way, if
       any biotech company wants to employ me, I can be found at this

       Ah - some friends have several bat colonies in and around their
       home (bats in their attic for real). They are worried about
       proposals for a windfarm near their home. But, if this affects
       migrating bats more than bats out and about on their normal
       flight-paths, perhaps this might reassure them on this point.

       This is, ultimately, an engineering problem. There will be lots of
       ways to address it that will work, more or less, at various costs,
       and one of them will turn out to be the best. Each person
       advocating one of the other alternatives will be disappointed, but
       will have lots of company.

       Well said Nate. Oh, the unintended consequences of cleaner energy.

       The added bonus of sa3r3t's suggestions of "some sort of sonic
       pulse which is sent at a high frequency to annoy the bats" is that
       it might also keep away the kids...

       Isn't it possible to fool the bat's sonar to think the wind farm is
       just a big solid object and so make them avoid it?
   14. web design company
       August 30, 2008
       Now that they understand this, they should be able to develop some
       kind of ultrasonic signal that repels bats, since the echo-location
       functions of bats are so sensitive to certain frequencies

       Let's not panic about a single study of a single wind farm that
       included only 188 bats. Have other possible causes for the
       barotrauma been ruled out? How many experts were consulted on
       possible causes. I am not dismissing the importance of evaluating
       environmental impacts, on the contrary, wind power has possibly
       enormous environmental benefits. Basing widespread policy decisions
       on a single, geographically limited study is not good policy or
       judgment.
   17. Ray H
       June 28, 2012
       Is it possible that bats are attracted to wind turbines by insects
       circling the lights used to warn away aircraft? If so, could the
       insects be attracted away from the turbines by light of a different
       color?
       Bats cannot always avoid collisions with moving objects. They are
       easy to catch with a net (not recommended, they are easily
       injured). A bat hit me in the face as I was walking into my kitchen
       several weeks ago.
