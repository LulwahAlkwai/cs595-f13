   An invisible, ancient source of energy surrounds us--energy that
   powered the first explorations of the world, and that may be a key to
   the future. This map shows you the delicate tracery of wind flowing
   over the US.
   Wind map prints are available from [3]Point.B Studio.

   The wind map is a personal art project, not associated with any
   company. We've done our best to make this as accurate as possible, but
   can't make any guarantees about the correctness of the data or our
   software. Please do not use the map or its data to fly a plane, sail a
   boat, or fight wildfires :-)
   If the map is missing or seems slow, we recommend the latest [6]Chrome
   browser.
   Surface wind data comes from the [7]National Digital Forecast Database.
   These are near-term forecasts, revised once per hour. So what you're
   seeing is a living portrait. (See the NDFD site for precise details;
   our timestamp shows time of download.) And for those of you chasing top
   wind speed, note that maximum speed may occur over lakes or just
   offshore.
   If you're looking for a weather map, or just want more detail on the
   weather today, see these more traditional maps of [8]temperature and
   [9]wind.
