[4]Privacy and the Internet: Is Facebook evil?

   For several of my classes, I open Facebook groups so that my students
   can exchange online. In some instances, it has worked great. Facebook
   tends to do a better job than school-provided posting boards. A small
   minority of students have taken offense to my practice for privacy
   reasons. It is fine: I would never require students to use Facebook.
   But I still think that some of these students might be misguided about
   what privacy is.

   First, we must recognize that it is very hard to be anonymous these
   days. Your smartphone can be tracked. You can be identified from the
   sites you browse. There are cameras everywhere. Employers record which
   sites you visit, which email you send or receive.

   However, it is hardly new. A few years back, I lived deep in the
   country. At some point, my car got stuck in the mud. A nice fellow
   passed us by and came to help us. When he was done, he asked about my
   wife's pregnancy. My wife did not show yet... and we never talked with
   this man, but he still knew all about us. This is how our ancestors
   lived. If you did something interesting or wrong, word got around. It
   is only when villages became towns and cities that we stopped caring
   about our neighbours. Mostly, this happened during the last century.
   For thousands of years, we lived in small communities where everybody
   knew everything about everyone. You could not cheat on your wife
   without all of the village to know within weeks.

   Some people love to hate Google or Facebook for all the information
   they gather. It seems very invasive. It seems like a violation of our
   privacy. Of course, compared to what happens in a small village, Google
   servers are much more powerful. If you sleep with the wrong person, all
   the village might know the next day... with Google, the wrong person
   could upload a video of your night for millions to see.

   However, the fact that privacy violation can be more damaging today
   does not change what privacy is and isn't.

   I consider myself a sophisticated computer user. I could find ways to
   make it hard for the power-that-be to track me. Yet I am not concerned
   enough to bother. In fact, I suspect that most computer scientists and
   software programmers make no attempt to hide on the web.

   Why is that?

   It is not that they don't value their privacy. Rather, it is because
   they recognize that there is a difference between invisibility and
   privacy. Remaining invisible is hard work and ultimately not what most
   people want. Very few people want to invisible to strangers.

   Intent is key. When I walk downtown, people see me. They see what I buy
   and when I buy it. There are cameras recording me. Yet I feel at ease.
   However, if someone followed me and recorded what I did, I would feel
   uneasy.

   Hence, if web servers record my HTTP request, there is no harm done.
   Sure enough, if someone has a good reason to, they can then trace back
   what actions and possibly hold it against me. But being observed, by
   itself, is fair game. In this sense, I am not overly worried about
   Google and Facebook, or my government. Collecting the information is
   not, by itself, cause for worry.

   Of course, people could use the trace I leave online to harm me
   somehow. But this record of my online activities is not, by itself, a
   violation of my privacy.

   People have accused Facebook of privacy violations. I'm sure it has
   happened. For example, maybe some Facebook engineer who wanted to go
   out with a woman decided to track and gather all information on this
   woman. This is creepy and should not been allowed. I'm hoping that such
   a woman could sue for damages and win.

   In general, however, the people behind Google and Facebook do not set
   out to violate your privacy. As a side product of their work, some
   people might have an easier time violating your privacy, but that's not
   the same. Rather it's like saying that power tools make murder easier.
   Though they do, that is not their intent.

   If you are going to stay away from Facebook for privacy fears, you
   should probably learn to always pay cash, do away with point cards,
   avoid cell phones and never use the web. As a student, it might be more
   profitable to use some of these technologies, but in a way that
   minimizes the harm people could do to you if they set out to violate
   your privacy. You should also be aware that even if you stay away from
   Facebook, YouTube and credit cards, people can use online technologies
   to harm you. Some of the most severe privacy cases I can recall had to
   do with people who did not use Facebook or YouTube. The genie is out of
   the bottle: you simply cannot wish these technologies away. They can
   cause harm to you no matter what. Closing down Facebook would not help.

   Update: Google and Microsoft are currently [5]suing the American
   government for the right to share with their users more information
   about how their sensitive information is being used. Facebook is
   [6]similarly trying to share the number of government requests it
   receives from the government. In other words, corporations view privacy
   breaches as bad for their business. Facebook and Google have no
   financial incentive to creep out their users.

    1. Interesting. I'm curious whether student privacy laws prevent the
       use of Facebook as a discussion board. I've actually been told
       strictly not to even use non-university resources for any course
       related stuff. Of course, that was in relation to the grading, but
       that also included student-teacher communications.
       Another peril of using Facebook for courses is that the material
       will be out there forever ... it's facebook's decision, not the
       course teachers (I mean, even if you delete some stuff, you don't
       know where they are copied, cached, retained etc.). That doesn't
       happen in a course system under your control.
       But I do agree that the age of privacy is virtually over :( ,
       though social networks have also given rise to anonymous bullying
       and online harassment ... another side of the coin.

    2. When you transgress in a tight-knit village, the gossipers know you
       as a person. They know you did wrong, but also the right you did
       before that. And in six months they might still joke about what you
       did, but it's old news.
       With the internet, your sins are broadcast without any indication
       that you're an actualized human being. And if the transgression is
       notable, there will constantly be new people learning for the first
       time what you did. Every job search is accompanied not be a dim
       recollection of that youthful slipup, but by a completely new
       revelation to the prospective employer when they google your name.
       Your example about walking down the street is similiar: I'd
       actually describe that, sans cameras, as closer to invisible. The
       next day I could wander that street with your photo, asking if you
       passed and what you did and where you visited, and at best I might
       get fragmentary "I think I walked by somebody who looked like
       him..." Contrast that with showing up with your photo and being
       handed a dossier with exactly where you walked, what you purchased,
       what other dates in the past 5 years you travelled this street.
       There's a monumental difference between fallible, distractable
       human memory and comprehensive storage of your life's minutia.
       As you say, the genie's out of the bottle. This is the world we
       live in. But simply equating the internet with a village, with our
       data trails as wandering anonymously through a city misses that
       this is a change in kind, not just degree. It may be that it isn't
       worth worrying about online privacy, or the endless data we leave
       in our wake, but that has to be because we decide it's not worth
       worrying about, not because we think it's the same as things were
       before. This is something fundamentally new and different, not just
       a minor variation on life 500 years ago.

    3. Very nice article. Yeah if some engineers from those companies want
       to access private data, they can do it though that is illegal. But
       without their service now a days its tough to live.

       Grades are private information that I never share.
       I don't even use email to send grades. I *only* store student
       grades on university servers. I don't even have a copy on my
       laptop. I couldn't tell what grades a student got without access to
       the university servers.
       It is not just a legal issue however. I think that it is generally
       harmful for students to spend too much time worrying about what
       grades their friends got.
       Comment by [16]Daniel Lemire -- 9/8/2013 @ [17]14:32
    6. But it's cumulative, right?
       Every service you put data into is ANOTHER point which might leak.
       The more services you use, the higher the risk.
       So it's not right to say : "leaving service X won't increase your
       privacy". All other things being equal, of course it will.

    7. Great. When I completed my Masters in May 2012 I too did online
       collaboration through social networks with my guide even, as our
       institute's intranet lacked portal for the same owing to poor
       network administration. Most connections reciprocated the good-will
       & trust I showed personally. Ships are meant to set sail, so I
       added acquaintances first, then whoever was apprehensive of privacy
       had to be removed. Those (extremist) who absolutely failed to grasp
       personal trust & mistook transparency for privacy violation had to
       be blocked. Considering how extroverted these people are, I was
       amused why they felt privacy violation. As a computer engineering
       professional, I prefer when my online provenance reflects my
       offline human self rather than God-like perfection. So if you
       belong to some far-off geographic locale & we've to connect as
       technology professionals or some such context, then I am more alive
       than life-less 3rd party letter announcing meeting amongst us,
       making our interactions reasonably meaningful. Welcome to the
       global village. This way if fortune arranges an in-person encounter
       then it causes lesser apprehension leading to stress. Online
       presence along-with mistakes suited to humans is more polite than
       unrealistically polished resumes & so forth. Its like being humble
       enough to say I'm fallible yet as team players we might fulfill
       something remarkable. If anyone's withholding private stuff online
       then it must be securely withheld offline first.

    8. "However, the fact that privacy violation can be more damaging
       today does not change what privacy is and isn't."
       I disagree with this statement completely. Privacy is a finely
       tuned social contract that has been thrown dramatically out of
       balance by the internet. If you change one part of the equation
       (e.g. the typical damage done by a privacy violation), you change
       how privacy functions in society in an important way. I happen to
       be reading Lawrence Lessig's "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace"
       right now, which has some interesting discussion on the topic.
       I am not saying that Facebook is evil or that we should aim for
       invisibility on the internet. However, I think we have a lot of
       work to do in reestablishing a well-balanced notion of privacy in
       modern internet'd culture.

    9. I don't use Facebook much because I kind of don't want to hear
       about the daily activities of everyone I know. Using it for
       technical discussions is probably the best use of it.
       Comment by [23]Carson Chow -- 10/8/2013 @ [24]10:33
   10. I think that this is a great discussion and most especially
       relevant to the times. In terms of the point that content is
       forever on the Internet it is also forever in the time before the
       Internet: We call it history, legend and myth and there are good
       things, bad things, and the in between.
       The Good - The signing of the Declaration of Independence
       The Bad - Nero fiddling while Rome burns
       The In Between - Marie Curie's discoveries
       What I believe the delta to be now is the speed an unaltered event
       can be distributed around the world without the filtering of
       history, community and more generally society. So in this case our
       global community is really in the middle of absorbing a new
       definition of privacy, not absorbing events and actions that are
       applied to the old definition of privacy.
       I think that all of this discussion is great and needs to be had as
       we adjust globally.

   11. Many Facebook privacy issues that have been in the media in the
       past few years have been about self-inflicted wounds - the
       part-time worker worker that fakes illness so he can go to the
       beach, and then posts his photos on his Facebook page so his boss
       sees them. That kind of thing. People have learned about that
       though, for the most part.
       With their IPO being hot news, in the past couple of years, some
       people made mention about Facebook privacy being a real issue
       because of advertising. I never thought that Facebook advertising
       would be a huge threat to privacy: whether you're using Facebook
       ads directly or a third party service via one of the types of
       companies listed at [27]http://www.buylikesreview.com for example,
       there's no way for any third party to get real personally
       identifying information merely through ad clicks. It's not ever in
       Facebook's self-interest for that data to ever be sent to
       businesses because of the value of the data.
       The big threat that Facebook poses to privacy, and what is really
       disconcerting, is their cozy relationship with government spying
       and the recent Snowden and other whistleblowing that has gone on.
       All of the non-denials that these big firms made read the same and
       looked carefully written to avoid saying the absolute truth.
       LavaBit coming out recently shuttering their business rather than
       complying with the Feds is a really big deal. That's the big reason
       why I'd agree with anybody calling Facebook evil. Even Google, a
       company that prides itself on "doing no evil" is walking down this
       horrible path.
       I personally would not recommend using Facebook in any aspect of
       any educational program, regardless of the convenience factor.
       Unfortunately, the government makes it so that regardless of what
       tools you use, you're likely spied on either way, so there has to
       be some political change as well.

       Do we have evidence that Facebook decided to hand over data to the
       government whereas they did not have the full might of government
       agencies against them?
       You know, conversations can go like this:
       - Hand over everything you have on X.
       - No
       - Ok, by this secret court order, we can send our armed agents
       directly in your server room and tap right in if you refuse to
       comply.
       - Ah. Ok, never mind, here is the data.
       Granted, we don't have the full story... but why don't we have the
       full story? Because the government (not Facebook) makes it illegal
       to share the full story.
       Comment by [29]Daniel Lemire -- 12/8/2013 @ [30]13:27
   13. @Daniel Lemire.
       The government is just taking advantage of the resources available
       to them. If Facebook hadn't consolidated so much personal
       information in one silo, then it would have been much more effort
       for the government to grab it.
       I'm not saying that Facebook were knowingly complicit in this. Or
       even deliberately "evil". That language is mystifying rather than
       clarifying.
       But I think in 2013 we can suddenly see the big problem we've just
       sleepwalked into by trusting our entire personal lives to a very
       small number of giant cloud-based social information providers.
       Corporations seek profits. They didn't get gigantic in order to
       sell us out to the government. But they did get gigantic in order
       to exploit their capacity to gather and crunch vast amounts of
       social data. The existence of such giant silos, run with the
       technology to manipulate it is an inherent risk.
       Think of it like pollution. No one in the world *wants* to pollute.
       But for some people it's an inevitable toxic byproduct of their
       business model.
       Facebook (or G+ etc.) don't want to imperil your civil rights, but
       it's an inevitable toxic byproduct of their business model.

   14. @Phil Jones
       Let me rewrite your first paragraph as follows:
       The government is just taking advantage of the resources available
       to them. If guns and bombs had not been invented, then it would
       have been much more effort for the government to wage wars and kill
       thousands.
       You see my point? I am just not as eager as most people to let the
       governments off the hook and blame social media instead. If people
       abuse social media, we should blame them, not social media.
       Facebook has been, overwhelmingly, a force for good. I would prefer
       a decentralized system, of course... but I see no reason to believe
       that a decentralized system could not be monitored by evil
       government forces.
       Think of it like pollution. No one in the world *wants* to pollute.
       But for some people it's an inevitable toxic byproduct of their
       business model.
       Right. So car manufacturers produce cars which, in turn, pollute.
       You should feel free not to use cars and buses, and planes. Walk or
       bike everywhere you go. Note however that, without cars and trucks,
       and planes, our civilization would collapse. We could not sustain
       it.
       I think that social media is like this. You can, individually,
       become a hard-core Luddite... but social media is now hard-wired
       into our civilization.
       Comment by [33]Daniel Lemire -- 12/8/2013 @ [34]15:44
   15. Sure, I absolutely DON'T want to let governments off the hook here.
       I'm extremely critical of them.
       But I AM rejecting the Libertarian manicheanism that divides the
       world into "government" (bad) / "private enterprise" (good) and
       then says that you can't hold private enterprise to account or
       political scrutiny just because it's not government or because
       government would be the tool to curb it.
       I'm demanding a more subtle political understanding that recognizes
       that "government" and "private wealth" are always intertwined and
       interdependent. And that you have to actually go beyond
       cheerleading one side or the other to criticize *this particular*
       blend of the two.
       In this case, the situation we've got ourselves into in 2013 is
       bad. And it's become bad because of the behaviour of BOTH
       government AND private corporations. And neither of them is excused
       just because of the kind of thing that they are.
       I disagree that Facebook is an overwhelming force for good in the
       context of the overall internet. I'm no Luddite; of course I think
       the overall internet is a net positive. But Facebook's domination
       is a negative compared to other, more open and pluralistic ways
       that internet culture might have evolved.

   17. @Phil Jones
       I am not sure why you bring about libertarians... but classical
       liberal values are not pro-corporation. Most libertarians opposed
       limited liability, which is at the core of the corporation. Most
       libertarians believe that without this government intervention,
       most "private companies" would be smaller than modern-day
       corporations and that there would be an actual market. Corporations
       tend to kill markets... in fact, they were created specifically
       with the goal of acquiring and maintaining monopolies...
       effectively getting rid of the small entrepreneurs.
       You are right that the distinction between a corporation and the
       government can be very slim. One is an extension of the other (it
       is sometimes unclear which is an extension of which)... but we
       should still lay the blame at the right spot.
       The example you give me to illustrate the "intertwingling of
       government and private sector" is the government poaching the chief
       security officer from Facebook. And that's somehow Facebook's
       fault? If you read the link you offer, the NSA is forcing companies
       to "collaborate". If the NSA is spying on us, it is 100% its fault.
       The NSA is almost certainly a pain in the neck for Facebook. They'd
       rather not have to deal with it, you can be sure of that. But they
       are being forced into it.
       In London, the government put cameras everywhere. I never hear a
       peep of protest about that. Yet, if Facebook decided to put cameras
       everywhere, what would you say? You would protest. So it is ok for
       the government, but not ok for Facebook...
       Why are the actions coming from Facebook somehow more dangerous and
       evil than when they come from the government?
       How many people has Facebook killed? How many people has your
       government killed? How often does Facebook use force to enforce its
       will... how many armed guards does Facebook have? What about your
       government?
       I think that a government is orders of magnitude more dangerous
       than a company like Facebook.
       Facebook's domination is a negative compared to other, more open
       and pluralistic ways that internet culture might have evolved.
       Before Facebook, the regular folks were simply cut off from social
       media. Social media was essentially a thing for the elite.
       Suppose that you killed Facebook and G+, how would you replace them
       with an "open and pluralistic" approach, that would not leave the
       bulk of the Facebook users in the dust? Who is going to provide the
       infrastructure and the support?
       But even if you did build the Facebook equivalent, why do you
       assume that the NSA would not just as easily abuse it?
       There is no getting around it. There would be abuse from the
       government with or without Facebook.
