   [11]media

   Who is the best journalist (so far) of the new millennium? Who has best
   embraced the opportunities afforded by digital media, and used them to
   deliver breaking news and incisive opinion to the greatest effect? Put
   like that, it's hard to wind up with any name other than Kara Swisher.

   As [12]David Carr and [13]Jay Rosen will tell you at length, we live in
   a world of the opinionated scoopmonger -- a world where a handful of
   brand-name journalists, wearing their opinions proudly, create a
   virtuous cycle of news. Ezra Klein is a good example: he is both very
   smart and incredibly well-sourced in Washington, which in turn lends a
   lot of credibility to his opinions. Because policymakers read him and
   respect him, they reach out to him and talk to him -- which in turn
   gives him insight, for his opinions, and also scoops, which only serve
   to consolidate his importance.

   Klein is in the process of building out his Wonkbook brand at the
   Washington Post: he's one of a handful of what [14]Jack Shafer calls
   the Marquee Brothers. Among the others: Andrew Ross Sorkin, Andrew
   Sullivan, and Nate Silver. All of them have strong personal brands, but
   only Klein is a true double threat, on both the opinion and the
   news-breaking front: Sullivan and Silver are read for their analyses,
   not for any news value they might have, while Sorkin, for all that he
   has a high-profile weekly column in the NYT, is still valuable mainly
   for his sources and the access (and information) those sources will
   predictably give him over any of his rivals. Indeed, there's a case to
   be made that Sorkin's column is in large part a means of buttering up
   the sources he's looking to get scoops and access from in future.

   There's value in all these models, and Sorkin's in particular is
   [15]not to be sneered at. But if you can master the dual arts of both
   analyzing and breaking important news, and if you can do so faster and
   better than anybody else, then truly the journalistic world is your
   oyster. Klein is good, when it comes to such skills. But Swisher is
   better. Her analysis is more interesting, and more pointed; her news
   scoops are hard, rock-solid items about boards and deals and companies,
   rather than being softer, more conceptual pieces about things like
   who's the front-runner to take over the Fed chairmanship.

   On top of that, Swisher, along with her partner Walt Mossberg, has been
   building the All Things D brand for much longer than Klein's been
   building Wonkbook, and they've created a true force in Silicon Valley.
   They're not some buried section of WSJ.com, in the way that Wonkbook is
   part of the Washington Post or Five Thirty Eight and Freakonomics were
   part of the NYT; they're an editorially independent, non-paywalled
   force of nature, competing aggressively against any and all journalists
   in other parts of their parent organization. People want to know what
   Swisher and Mossberg -- and Peter Kafka, and Jason Del Rey, and Liz
   Gannes, and the rest of the ATD editorial staff -- have to say. They
   love the way the site is designed, and the way in which it's open to
   featuring many voices from outside News Corp. They're reassured by the
   site's editorial transparency, its writers' detailed codes of ethics,
   and the fact that over many years it has proved itself to be extremely
   reliable in reporting the news. And, of course, they come back
   regularly to read the constant stream of scoops that ATD serves up.

   Swisher, then, has created not just an amazing personal brand, but also
   a highly enviable corporate one. ATD is in many ways the most
   glittering digital jewel that News Corp owns -- much more than its 5%
   stake in Vice, or the also-ran nypost.com website, or any of the stuff
   that gets hidden behind various paywalls. But according to [16]Fortune,
   there's now a real possibility that News Corp is going to allow Swisher
   and Mossberg to slip out of its grasp:

     Reuters reported in [17]February that AllThingsD co-executive
     editors Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg had begun discussions with
     owner Dow Jones, a subsidiary of News Corp, about either ending or
     extending their partnership, which is set to expire on December 31.

     Since then, Fortune has learned that AllThingsD is working with
     investment bank Code Advisors to find outside investors at an
     enterprise value that could exceed the $25 million that AOL
     reportedly paid in 2010 for rival site TechCrunch. One source says
     that the asking price is between $10 million and $15 million for a
     25% or 30% stake in the company...

     Dow Jones officially owns the AllThingsD brand, website and content.
     It also manages the site's ad sales, but only Mossberg is an actual
     Dow Jones employee. Swisher and the rest of her AllThingsD editorial
     colleagues are contractors paid via an independent limited liability
     company. One scenario could involve the AllThingsD team leaving to
     start an independent venture with a new name, while Dow Jones
     retains the AllthingsD brand (and possibly the archived editorial
     content).

   What's happened here is that Swisher and Mossberg have created
   something with substantial value -- as much as $50 million. And since
   the value lies with them, rather than in the ATD brand, they can walk
   away and find a strategic partner willing to invest an eight-figure sum
   in creating a new, entirely independent brand. That's got to be
   attractive to them, for two reasons: firstly, they would become truly
   independent, and in control of their own destiny. No more begging their
   New York paymasters for extra investment: if they own the company, they
   can make all those decisions themselves. And then, of course, there's
   the money: if they each own say 25% of a $50 million company, that's a
   lot of paper wealth which they're never going to accumulate working for
   News Corp, and which -- in the way of Silicon Valley -- could become
   worth much more still if their expansion plans work out the way they
   hope they will.

   Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch stands firmly on the other side of the Great
   Paywall Divide, and feels as a matter of principle that all of his
   properties (except, perhaps, nypost.com) should charge readers for
   their content. He's also human, which means that, like all other
   humans, he's deeply reluctant to pay a large amount of money to buy
   something he already owns.

   Murdoch, by rights, should be able to retain control of ATD, complete
   with Swisher and Mossberg. They're offering very little to his rivals:
   a minority stake, no editorial control whatsoever, and probably very
   little cashflow, at least for the first few years, since as a startup
   they're going to want to reinvest all of their revenues back into their
   company. Meanwhile, News Corp has the opportunity to own ATD 100%
   (indeed, it already does), and can offer Swisher and Mossberg the
   ability to invest in the site without having to go through the hassles
   of rebranding and relaunching. Given the economics of control premiums,
   Murdoch should easily be able to promise significantly more resources
   than his rivals can come up with.

   But after years of writing the entrepreneurial gospel, it's
   understandable that Swisher and Mossberg might want to live it for
   themselves. And they're both wealthy enough to afford a few years of
   startup wages: Mossberg has been one of Murdoch's highest-paid print
   journalists for years, while Swisher, who's well paid herself, is also
   married to long-time Google executive Megan Smith.

   Swisher and Mossberg built the ATD franchise as far away from New York
   and Murdoch's interference as they could -- they based it in
   California, and refused even to share back-end technology with Dow
   Jones. That decision was smart: one look at The Daily shows what
   happens if you're too close to the man himself. They don't need News
   Corp -- but if News Corp aspires to be a real force in digital media,
   it really does need them. The digital world is closer to TV than print,
   in terms of the importance of talent management and talent retention.
   If Murdoch and his dealmakers can't hold on to Swisher and Mossberg,
   News Corp's digital future looks pretty bleak.

   People inside the Wall Street Journal have known for many months that
   Walt and Kara's contract was coming up for renewal; the word has always
   been, "We'll know things are getting serious when Kara leaks a story to
   someone about how valuable the two of them are, which is something they
   always do." Felix, congratulations: You got to be that leak for 2013!

   This is an excellent post. The analysis of Sorkin is apt.
