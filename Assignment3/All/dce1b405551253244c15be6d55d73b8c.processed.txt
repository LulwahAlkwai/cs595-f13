   The Scripps CO[2] measurements at Mauna Loa have been supported for
   many years by the [18]U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and have more
   recently been supplemented by [19]Earth Networks, a technology company
   that is collaborating with Scripps to expand the global GHG monitoring
   network. Support for website development was provided in part by the
   [20]National Science Foundation (NSF). Any opinions, findings, and

   [33]Sources and Sinks Posted on July 3, 2013 -- [34]1 Comment |v


   A companion phenomenon of emitting CO[2] into the atmosphere is the
   loading of the oceans with elevated levels of carbon dioxide created by
   fossil fuel burning and other human activities.

[43]Why Does Atmospheric CO2 Peak in May?

   [44]Measurement Notes Posted on June 4, 2013 -- [45]6 Comments |v

   Tim Lueker, research scientist in the Scripps CO2 Research Group, only
   needs one sentence to explain why atmospheric CO[2] peaks in May.

   "Springtime comes in May in Siberia," he says.

   Let's take a look at the details of this statement... [46]Read More ->

       in the Atmosphere? During the last ice age CO2 levels dropped to
       near plant starvation levels. } -
