Pope says atheists can be moral like Catholics

   ("The question for people...)

   ROME: Pope Francis on Wednesday said atheists could take moral
   decisions just like religious people, in an unprecedented letter to a
   leftwing Italian daily - his latest attempt to reach out to
   non-believers.

   "God's mercy has no limits if we turn to him with a sincere and
   contrite heart," the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics said
   in a missive published in La Repubblica by its founder Eugenio
   Scalfari.

   "The question for people who do not believe in God is to listen to
   their consciences. Also for those without faith, sin is going against
   your conscience," he said.

   "Listening to it and obeying it means making up one's mind about what
   is good and evil," he added.

   The letter was the 76-year-old pope's reply to questions posed in the
   newspaper in July and August by Scalfari, who had admitted to not
   believing in God.

   Since being elected in March, the Argentine pope has repeatedly said he
   wants his words to be heard by faithful from other religions and
   non-believers.

   During a blessing in St Peter's Square in May, Francis said
   non-believers could be redeemed just like Catholics - an unusual
   message that was quickly denied by a Vatican spokesman who said that
   anyone who refuses the Catholic Church "cannot be saved".

   "The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ.
   All of us, not just Catholics. Everyone! 'Father, the atheists?' Even
   the atheists. Everyone!" the pope said in his address in May.

   "We must meet one another doing good. 'But I don't believe, Father, I
   am an atheist!' But do good: we will meet one another there," he said.
