Voyager 1 Reaches Interstellar Space, a Milestone for Human Exploration

   What's This?
   Voyager1space

   By Amanda Wills2013-09-12 18:00:59 UTC

   More than 11.6 billion miles away from Earth, NASA's Voyager 1 has
   finally reached interstellar [48]space, scientists confirmed Thursday.

   "It's clearly a major milestone in the history of exploration --
   there's no doubt about that," Edward Stone, Voyager 1 project
   scientist, told Mashable Tuesday. "This is sort of like the first
   circumnavigation of the globe or the first footprints on the moon."

   Stone and his team at [49]NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory launched
   Voyager 1 into space 36 years ago at a time when the space agency
   relied on paper, chalkboards and raw computational genius to build
   spacecrafts. There was so much room for error -- and yet Voyager 1 is
   arguably one of NASA's most successful missions and most certainly the
   biggest bang for its buck.

   As it whizzed past Jupiter and Saturn on its journey through space,
   Voyager 1 showed us the diversity of the planets and their numerous
   moons. For Stone, the most memorable moment was when Voyager 1 revealed
   eight active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon lo. Up until that point, we
   had thought Earth was the only home to volcanoes.

   "That just set the tone for the rest of the mission," Stone said. "Time
   after time, we were surprised to find things that we hadn't even
   suspected that we were going to see. And the result of all that was we
   realized how diverse the bodies are in our solar system -- they are
   familiar in form but diverse in detail."

   Stone went on to become director of JPL and eventually retired in 2001,
   but he never left the Voyager mission. While most of the original team
   is now remote, a few members still work in an office at JPL's
   headquarters in Pasadena, Calif., where the control room downloads
   information sent from Voyager 1 (which takes 17 hours to travel back to
   Earth from the spacecraft's current location).

   Last August, the spacecraft detected a sharp change in cosmic ray data,
   suggesting it had reached the very edge of our solar system. In
   December, NASA confirmed Voyager 1 had entered a new region of the
   solar system that was the "final area the spacecraft has to cross
   before reaching interstellar space."

   If this story sounds familiar, it's because many news outlets
   [51]jumped the gun earlier this year when a report -- based on that
   [52]cosmic ray data -- claimed Voyager 1 had exited the heliosphere.
   However, for Stone, the cosmic ray flip was just one piece of the
   puzzle -- an unsteady piece that could change at any moment. Despite
   popular opinion, it wasn't enough to confirm the spacecraft had indeed
   reached interstellar space. So, Stone waited patiently for another
   signal he expected -- one that would show a significant change the
   magnetic field.

   That signal never materialized. Instead, Stone and the Voyager team got
   lucky in April when an unexpected gift arrived. A giant coronal mass
   ejection, also known as a solar flare, had erupted from the sun in
   March 2012. It was so massive that it reached the Curiosity rover while
   it was en route to Mars.

   When that same flare hit Voyager 1 nearly 13 months later, it "jiggled"
   the plasma around the spacecraft, generating oscillations that were
   picked up by the spacecraft's plasma wave instrument. The frequency of
   the waves proved it was now traveling into an area with high-density
   plasma that continued to steadily thicken -- exactly what they expected
   to find in interstellar space. (You can actually [53]hear the waves in
   the recording here -- the higher the density, the higher the pitch.)

   It's important to note that while Voyager 1 is in a new region of
   space, it has not left our solar system. Our solar system is defined as
   everything that is affected by the sun's gravitational force. That
   includes the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud that outlines the boundary
   of our solar system. It will take Voyager 1 another 300 years to reach
   the beginning of the Oort cloud and another 30,000 years or so to exit.
   It will be 40,000 years before Voyager 1 reaches the nearest star,
   Gliese 445, and adopts its gravitational pull.

   However, Voyager 1's battery power will run out between 2020 and 2025,
   so the future human race won't be able to track it. (Though the
   spacecraft does hold a recording of our "greetings from Earth" to
   anyone who could potentially find it down the road.) That still gives
   JPL scientists a few good years to crank through Voyager 1's new data
   from an unexplored region of space.

   As for Stone, 77, this isn't a time to sit back and bid farewell to
   Voyager 1. In fact, he may once again become a familiar face around the
   JPL campus.

   "It's not the end," he said. "It's actually the beginning of a whole
   new journey."
