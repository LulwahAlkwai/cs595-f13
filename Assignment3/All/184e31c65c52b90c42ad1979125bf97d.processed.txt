Patent perspiration not inspiration

   Little irks me more than the current state of US patent law. It stifles
   innovation and encourages [13]patent trolls, the most famous being
   Nathan Myhrvold's [14]Intellectual Ventures. The main problem is that
   we are allowing patents for the wrong thing. Currently, patents are
   awarded for innovative ideas, which means you can try to patent fairly
   obvious ideas like a device that converts optical images
   into digital information, which amazingly enough is owned by one patent
   troll who is trying to extort money out of anyone who has ever used a
   scanner, including nonprofits (see [15]here). [16]This American Life
   had an episode devoted to this topic (see [17]here). What we should do
   instead is to patent the effort and cost sunk into developing an idea
   into a product. [18]Alex Tabarrok has been writing about this topic for
   a long time and has a nice paper giving the economic reasons of why
   this would be better (see [19]here for reprint). You should only get
   patent protection in proportion to the costs you have incurred in
   developing the idea.

   Ideas are cheap; turning them into successful businesses is the hard
   part. Me, and probably everyone else, had the idea for [20]Google
   Glass years if not decades ago. I had no idea how to make it work, nor
   did I put any effort in trying to do so. I just thought it would be
   great to have a projection screen built into glasses. Actually, my full
   idea was that it would project an image onto the retina with the focus
   set at infinity so I wouldn't have to strain my eyes to read it. I
   don't think anyone should be able to patent such an idea. We should
   encourage lots of companies to come up with ways of implementing
   eyeglass projection systems and let them battle it out in the
   marketplace. In some sense, fashion should be our model. You can't
   patent fashion so designers must constantly innovate to keep ahead of
   the imitators. If anything, there is too much innovation in fashion.
   Given that we are now on the wrong side of the "[21]Tabarrok Curve",
   the argument that abolishing patents would stifle innovation is no
   longer valid. This is one issue that both liberals and libertarians
   should agree on. If we are to get any laws passed at all this
   congressional term, we should get patent reform.

       I'm pessimistic. Just patent law alone is a billion dollar
       industry.
       The US has been pursuing a strong lobby to force patents down the
       throat of the whole planet.
       On the plus side, if the US were to let go patents, then the whole
       world might follow.
       Note: the nice things about patents is that they are strictly
       limited. This means that it is easy to phase them out.

       I wasn't calling for a complete elimination of patents, just one
       based on sunk cost rather than idea. Reforms along these lines
       could possibly get the big tech and pharma firms on board who may
       want to avoid all the lawsuits and dispense with collecting patents
       for defensive purposes. After all, a patent troll basically
       destroyed, or at least distracted, RIM. On the other hand, maybe
       they like it the way it is since excessive litigation is a barrier
       to entry for small companies.
