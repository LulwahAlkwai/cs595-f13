Scientists in Action: Q&A - the Imposter Syndrome

   by · Wednesday, Jul 17, 2013

Question:[33] 732

    Some students tend to feel at the beginning of graduate school that
   they do not belong, were admitted on accident, or feel like an
   impostor. Did you ever experience the imposter syndrome? If so, when
   did you grow out of this feeling and how did you gain more confidence?
   If you did not personally experience this, how do you advise students
   as they navigate these difficult feelings?

   Special note: All of the featured scientists who responded to this
   question are keynote speakers at the 2013 SACNAS National Conference.

[34]729 Dr. KaurJudith Salmon Kaur, MD

   Discipline: Oncology
   Ethnic Background: Choctaw/Cherokee
   Title: Medical Director, Native American Programs
   Institution: Mayo Comprehensive Cancer Center

   "Am I good enough?" is the inherent question. Since I came from a
   family where no one had graduated from high school, I did not set my
   academic sights on being an MD or PhD. Those inspirations came to me
   later. By then, though, I had been out of school for almost nine years
   and had stayed home to raise my daughter. One graduate school
   interviewer said to me, "You used to be a good student..."

   I honestly had no idea what a long time it would be before I reached my
   goal. Indeed, my goal changed along the way from being "a doctor" to
   being an oncologist--even more years of commitment. Fortunately I had
   great support from my husband, who really felt I would not only succeed
   but also be, in his words, "a great doctor"!

   Earning my degree was a family journey. My daughter was three when I
   started medical school. One day I was reading her a story and the word
   important came up. I asked her if she knew what that meant and she
   said, "Important is that you will be a doctor so you can help Uncle
   Frank with his heart." It brought tears to my eyes and was a solid
   reminder that what I was intent on doing was to help people who need
   me.

   I have been blessed over the years to be validated that the decision to
   be a doctor was the road I was meant to follow.

[35]730 Dr. MegginsonRobert E. Megginson, PhD

   Discipline: Mathematics
   Ethnic Background: Oglala Sioux
   Title: Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Mathematics
   Institution: University of Michigan

   I certainly did have attacks of impostor syndrome early in my life. It
   started with a first-grade teacher who could not figure out whether to
   place me in the slow or intermediate group in class. (This was in the
   days when three-track grouping of students was still the norm in grade
   school; what a way to start hanging labels on kids early on that they
   end up believing!)

   I was saved by a strong-willed American Indian mother who was willing
   to face down teachers when they were imposing their own ill-founded
   beliefs on impressionable young people, as well as by a second-grade
   teacher who had faith in me and wanted to convince me that I was
   capable of higher aspirations.

   But, yes, impostor syndrome hung on a while (with this little voice
   inside me saying, "What if that first-grade teacher was right, and I'm
   just setting myself up for failure?"). My advice for shaking the
   feeling is just to have strong mentors, including parents (they
   certainly count) who can show you what you are capable of doing,
   instead of trying to scrape up slim evidence for what they believe you
   aren't capable of doing. Then listen to them.

   And as far as getting even with the people who gave you a dose of the
   syndrome? Don't dwell on it, but just remember that old saying that
   "success is the best revenge."

[36]731 Dr. RodriguezRaymond L. Rodriguez, PhD

   Discipline: Molecular & Cellular Biology
   Ethnic Background: Hispanic
   Title: Professor, Department of Molecular & Cellular Biology; Director,
   Center of Excellence in Nutritional Genomics
   Institution: University of California, Davis

   Yes, I've experienced the imposter syndrome and I tell you it's not
   something you grow out of; but rather, it's something you learn to
   master--just as experienced professionals master anxiety and stage
   fright.

   The good news is that I can now quickly recognize the symptoms
   associated with the imposter syndrome. The bad news is that I didn't
   recognize these symptoms for many years. Whether it's the classroom or
   the boardroom, it's not uncommon for people, regardless of ethnicity,
   gender, or socioeconomic status, to feel that they don't belong because
   they're different.

   The key word here is feel, because feelings are not reality. The
   impostor syndrome elicits strong feelings that, if left unchecked, can
   lead to negative thoughts, which in turn can lead to a negative
   feedback loop of self-defeating behaviors that almost guarantee
   failure.

   Yes, the world of academics was not created with underrepresented
   minorities in mind. It was a haven, created nearly a thousand years
   ago, for the second sons of the privileged who were not destined to be
   "lords of the manor" or priests. Universities have evolved dramatically
   over the years, but vestiges of privilege that trigger feelings of
   alienation still remain. For me, it is Sir William Walton's "Orb and
   Sceptre," a composition played at thousands of commencement ceremonies
   every year. (I can't stand it!)

   The key point is to learn to transform a negative syndrome into a
   positive signal--a signal that alerts you to focus on the tasks at hand
   and not on what you're feeling, what you look like, or what others
   think of you. Remove yourself from under the microscope, sit up and
   "lean in" as Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg says. If you can do this,
   you'll have your seat at the table and your space at the lab bench.
