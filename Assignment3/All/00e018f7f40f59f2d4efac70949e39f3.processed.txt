   For consumers with Windows 8 devices today, Windows 8.1 will be a free
   update via an easy download from the Windows Store* [24]starting on
   October 18th**. Windows 8.1 will be a must-have update for those
   devices - bringing new features and improvements such as greater
   personalization, Bing Smart Search, and [25]more than 20 new and
   improved Microsoft apps and services. We are excited to be delivering
   such an important update to customers in just one month and nearly a
   year after launching Windows 8. However we also recognize there will be
   some folks who may want to upgrade devices running older versions of
   Windows to Windows 8.1. The information in this blog post is meant for
   those people.

   Consumers who are not using a Windows 8 device will be able to buy
   Windows 8.1, either as a download from Windows.com or at your local
   store as a retail packaged DVD product. While pricing varies by market,
   in the U.S., Windows 8.1 will be available for $119.99 ERP (U.S.) and
   Windows 8.1 Pro will be available for $199.99 ERP (U.S.). The pricing
   and editions for Windows 8.1 are similar to what we have today for
   Windows 8.

   [28]Win8.1_ProPack_Boxshot_LeftAngle

   One shift to note in Windows 8.1 is that we will be offering "full
   version software" at retail and online for download that does not
   require a previous version of Windows in order to be installed. The
   copy of Windows 8 that is currently available for sale at retail and
   online is an "upgrade version." This shift allows more flexibility for
   customers in specific technical scenarios and is in response to
   feedback we've received. It will be easier for those consumers who want
   to build PCs from scratch, run Windows 8.1 in Virtual Machine (VM)
   environments, or run Windows 8.1 on a second hard drive partition.

   For non-Windows 8 devices, here is how upgrading to Windows 8.1 using
   the retail DVD and download software will work:
     * Windows 7: Consumers can upgrade a Windows 7 PC which will bring
       along all their files, but will require them to reinstall desktop
       apps including Microsoft Office.
     * Windows XP & Windows Vista: Windows 8.1 is not designed for
       installation on devices running Windows XP or Windows Vista.
       Although not designed or recommended for devices running Windows XP
       or Windows Vista, consumers still wanting to upgrade from Windows
       XP or Windows Vista should buy the retail DVD instead of using the
       download and boot from the DVD to do a clean install of Windows
       8.1. Note: files, settings and programs will not transfer -
       Consumers will need to back up their files and settings, perform
       clean installation, and then reinstall their files, settings and
       programs.

   If you buy a device later this year that comes with the Windows 8.1
   edition, you will be able to purchase the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack for
   $99.99 ERP (U.S.), which unlocks all of the great features unique to
   Pro, as well as Windows Media Center. If you are on Windows 8.1 Pro,
   you can buy Windows Media Center for $9.99 (U.S.).

   If you are on the market for a new device today, I suggest taking
   advantage of our [29]PC Selectorto find the right Windows 8 device that
   is perfect for you. And remember, you will be able to update your
   device to Windows 8.1 for free through the Windows Store.

   [30]Windows 8.1 evolves Windows 8, bringing the latest advancements in
   hardware, apps and services and the OS to enable a unique experience in
   everything you do.

   More to come on Windows 8.1 including new devices and retail offers as
   we near October 18th!

   * Internet access required; fees may apply.
   ** Starting at 12:00am on October 18th in New Zealand (that's 4:00am
   October 17th in Redmond).

       [43]yuhong - I'm sorry, I'm unsure what you mean by "Windows
       desktop upgrades". As mentioned in the above blog post - retail
       product for Windows 8.1 are now "full versions" of the product
       unlike with Windows 8 where it was "upgrade versions". But you can
       still use the Windows 8.1 retail product to upgrade a device.

       If anyone from MSFT can respond to the questions below on Windows
       Media Center it would be really helpful.
       Is there any plans to update WMC since you are charging for it
       shouldn't the folks who paid for it be entitled to get some kind of
       upgrades?
       Is WMC end of life as a product?  Brandon please help/answer as WMC
       is running entire home for Video music and pictures.

       I can't find a single desirable feature in Win 8[.1]. It's your
       interest to push me towards your app store and I won't be paying
       you 200$ for that. My Win 7 is supported until 2020+. Later.

       Hi Brandon,
       With Windows 8, people can currently they can use the Upgrade
       Assistant to check out whether their PC is likely to run Windows 8.
       For folks who have Vista and XP, who are recommended to go out and
       buy a DVD, it would be really useful to know if there's a
       compatibility showstopper on the PC before they go out and buy a
       DVD.
       This would be especially useful as these are the computers whose
       hardware is likely to be older and more likely to have problems..
       Will there be a Windows 8.1 Upgrade Assistant for people to use
       before they buy?
       Also, is there anything more you can tell us on how the upgrade
       from 8.1 Preview to the real 8.1 will work?
       Thanks!

       Can somebody from Microsoft explain how are people with local
       accounts supposed to get this update ? The 8.1 update is a
       system-wide OS update, not a modern app, so why isn't it available
       through Windows Update ?
       I hope you really understand that one of the reasons why many
       people dislike Windows 8 is the fact that the message it sends
       across by not being able to boot directly to the desktop is that
       you are more interested in shoving the store into people's faces no
       matter the device they are using, than any real concern for desktop
       users' UI.
       You made partial amends to fix the situation with Windows 8.1
       (insufficient in my opinion, as the taskbar disappears when you
       switch to the modern interface meaning there is still a divide and
       a very real lack of coherency and thus desktop multi tasking
       workflow is disrupted by having to shift back and forth and not
       being able to immediately switch between running applications or
       just visually check if they or any OS function (a file copy
       operation, for example) needs your attention) but seemingly found a
       new way to shove the store into people's faces by requiring them to
       create an on-line account in order to get into the store in order
       to get the Windows 8.1 update.

       [61]DavidY65 - Because Windows  8.1 is not designed for
       installation on devices running Windows XP or Windows Vista, I do
       not believe a standalone "upgrade assistant" is being planned.
       When you move from the Windows 8.1 Preview to the final release of
       Windows 8.1 - you'll be able to keep your personal files, but
       you'll need to reinstall your apps.

       Hi Brandon,
       Nice to hear about 8.1!
       I have two questions.
       What about DSP version, will it still exist?
       And, do you have the price now?
       Will there be a way to upgrade from 8 to 8.1, not using Windows
       Store?
       I mean I want to download and store the upgrade file like previous
       service pack,
       since I have much chance to re-install my windows.
       Thank you.

       Will customers running windows 8 be provided with windows 8.1 ISO?
       because, in case PC crashed we would have to install windows 8
       first and then windows 8.1 via store. That would be time consuming
       as well as cumbersome. I hope there will be other options available
       and not just the update via windows store.

       Will you repeat the the 40 USD promo price for a limited time? You
       should, becuase many people will find this upgrade price way too

       Testing the RTM I hesitate between the congratulory mode and the
       shouting mode.
       + There are many imrpovement. The music app, for example, is
       finally useable and frankly it is abolutely gorgeous.
       + The possibility to have Modern apps on many screens is great
       - The start screen is a bing letdown and I hope that this is due to
       bugs that will be fixed before the launch.
       - In Windows 8 my right screen (the bigger one) is configured as
       the main screen - because many apps don't remember where they are
       used and always launch in main screen. So the first thing I did in
       the morning is show the start screen then use Windows+Page Down to
       move it to left screen. Then the start screen would be on the left
       screen all day, as wanted and the main screen used for main apps
       (e.g. Outlook 2013 & co)
       - Now Windows + Page Up and Windows + Page Down do not work anymore
       - Now the start screen keep changing screen. I haven't found a way
       to keep it on the left monitor. I can't emphasize enough how this
       is unnerving and productivity-destroying.
       - Internet explorer. The odd treatment for Internet Explorer make
       me want to vomit. Apparently one is to either use the Modern one or
       the Desktop one but not both. I happen to like to work with both
       simultaneously and this is a scenario that Microsoft made
       astoundingly awkward in 8.1 whereas it worked really well in
       Windows 8.
       -> If Modern IE is the default there is a tile for it on the start
       screen. It is then impossible to add a tile for the desktop IE on
       the start screen (it was possible on Windows 8)
       -> It is impossible to search for iexplorer.exe. The search will
       give results on the web but won't give any result in C\Program
       Files (Windows 8 did find it). This is absolutely an astounding
       censorship.
       -> Creating a desktop shortcut to iexplorer.exe then trying pin it
       on start screen won't work
       -> Copying iexplore.exe & giving another name won't work.
       In short why did Microsoft invest so much time and effort making
       life miserable for the users that like to work with both explorers?

       I hope that the Windows Store free upgrade will include an ISO file
       (or similar) and a CD-KEY of some sort in the event that in the
       future if my new Windows 8.1 system may crash it may need to be
       reinstalled from an install file or actual DVD and I'm assuming it
       will probably need a CD-KEY or similar to do such a re-install.
       Does anyone yet know the answer to this critical question?

       AT the risk of overplaying my point, I hope that the Windows Store
       upgrade to 8.1 allows us to download the full file to keep for
       obvious archival needs before any installation can begin (as noted
       above) and that this upgrade (as opposed to the Windows Store
       preview upgrade) does not just automatically start the upgrading
       process on its own leaving us with no backup for future re-install
       capabilities and no re-install key!  I think this is critically
       important!

       Mr. Tomtag, sorry if I'm misunderstanding  your problem, but if you
       already have Win8, then you should have a CD-Key of your Win8.
       Since upgrading to Win8.1 from Win8 is free, there won't be a new
       Key required, I think. Of course, no any trouble around license. If
       you have lost your Key, well, that is the problem, not Win8.1.
       The one who's worrying about re-installing is not only you. I hope
       there will be some way to upgrade to Win8.1, skipping the time of
       downloading.

       I am currently running 8.1 evaluation, which quite honestly I
       mistakenly thought was something like a service pack. It has given
       me problems but I have solved them.  Now I read that I will lose
       8.1 at some point and if I upgrade to 8.1 final I have to re
       install all my programs.  Some cannot be installed more than once
       so I will have to buy them again including a very expensive HD
       video editing suite.  Can this really be true?  Can't I just
       install 8.1 over my evaluation?

       Thanks Brandon.  In response to your thoughtful response about the
       free upgrade of 8.1 from the Windows Store, I do have my CD-Key for
       Windows 8 so that's not a problem.  What I am concerned about is
       that when the Windows Store made the 8.1 Preview available, it
       directly from the store installed the preview version without
       supplying a copy of the upgrade in a format that would allow for
       possible future re-installation.  My computer crashed due to a
       virus a few weeks ago, and the only way I could restore it was to
       do a new install from my original Windows 8 DVD.  So I am back to
       Windows 8 because the Windows store never supplied an ISO file or
       similar for later installation.  That is what I am hoping they do
       with the new full retail version upgrade.  That's my question!

       The actual version of Windows 8 is only an upgrade:
       * we have the possibility to create an iso file using the upgrade
       assistant
       * if we are trying to install it on a PC without an OS using this
       file at the end of the installation, when activating we are
       receiving the message that this PK is for an upgrade only
       * when the Windows 8.1 will be released, we will get this version
       for free as an upgrade
       * which will be than the installation process for the customers who
       already purchased Windows 8?
       * will the PK be used as a full version (Windows 8)?
       * will it be necessary to install the previous version (Windows 7,
       Vista or XP), after to upgrade to Windows 8 or 8 Pro and finally
       upgrade to Windows 8.1?

       This has always been an expectation from regular users of windows
       that microsoft should provide them some discount on an upgrade.
