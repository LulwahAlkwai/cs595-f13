   HP's Successful Turn Around Is Closer Than It Looks
   Over the last several weeks I've been chatting with a number of folks
   inside HP and there is amazing progress being made on a number of
   fronts. Inside their strategy to take much of the emerging unified
   communications market from Cisco is moving far more powerfully than I
   was aware of and the firm as Cisco moves to compete with other old
   Cisco partners HP is moving in with those partners to take Cisco's
   place. One of the most interesting moves is with their new Chromebook
   as they attempt to emulate with Google what IBM did with Microsoft DOS
   and Windows. Of course one of the most secret projects is their 3D
   printer effort. Full column in CIO today:
