Introduction

   [15]Science Writers in New York (SWINY), [16]The Hastings Center, and
   City University of New York (CUNY) [17]Graduate School of Journalism
   present a unique one-day workshop on Friday, March 30 from 8:30 a.m. to
   4:30 p.m., "Bioethics Bootcamp: Finding the Must-Read Angle for Science
   and Medical Stories."
   Courtesy CUNY Graduate School of Journalism

   Funded by a grant from the [18]National Association of Science Writers
   (NASW), the Bootcamp will be held at the CUNY Graduate School of
   Journalism, 219 West 40th Street. Bioethics Bootcamp was developed
   because today's science writers have to understand and communicate
   advances in science and technology that frequently raise immediate or
   potential ethical concerns for individuals, institutions, families, and
   society.

   Throughout the day, a series of panel discussions and question-answer
   opportunities will feature leading bioethicists, journalists, scholars
   and scientists exploring a specific, sensitive issue, ranging from
   conflicts of interest to genetics, human life from beginning to end,
   and emerging biotechnology. In the Bootcamp's closing panel, editors
   from scientific, business, and consumer media will share their criteria
   and considerations for health or medical topics with a bioethical
   aspect. Attendees and panelists are invited to mingle from 4:30 onward
   at a wine and cheese reception.
