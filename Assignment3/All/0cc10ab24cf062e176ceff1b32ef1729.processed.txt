Making Money the (Computationally) Hard Way

   Digital cash systems have come and gone but [5]Bitcoin seems to be
   doing okay. By request I am giving a lecture about Bitcoin in my crypto
   class. Most of the material I find about Bitcoin is either very high
   level for a typical user or very low-level detail for the implementer.
   In this post I'll try to hit the middle ground.
   Bitcoin tries a different approach to digital case. Their goal is not
   anonymity but more a cash system that works in a peer-to-peer network
   without a central authority.
   The basics of Bitcoin come from a [6]paper by the mysterious [7]Satoshi
   Nakamoto. The Bitcoin systems doesn't use encryption but it does make
   strong use of secure hash functions and digital signatures. A user
   establishes an account by creating public and private keys for an
   elliptic-curve based signature scheme. A hash of the public key serves
   as the account number.
   A [8]transaction from person A to B roughly consists of the amount, a
   link to an earlier transaction where A received bitcoins, B's account
   number, A's public key and A's signature of all of the above.
   Transactions are transmitted to everyone. More general transactions are
   also possible.
   Transactions aren't accepted until they appear in a [9]block. A block
   consists of a [10]hash-tree of transactions, an extra transaction
   giving 50 bitcoins to the block creator (this will decrease over time),
   a hash of the previous block, a time stamp and something called a
   nonce. The nonce is just an extra number chosen so that the hash of the
   block has a certain number of zeros in the right place.
   You create money by creating blocks which requires finding the right
   nonce, a computationally difficult task. The number of zeros is set so
   that a new block is created on average every ten minutes. A transaction
   is accepted when there is a chain of six block starting with the one
   where the transaction occurs. This prevents double spending as that
   firmly establishes this chain as the "official" one.
   There's a lot more details but the idea is a clever use of computation
   to mine money like one can mine gold with considerable effort. Or you
   can get money by trading goods or services (or real currency).
   Not clear to me that it could scale for wide-spread use but still quite
   a clever and so far working system.

       Whether it is working is open to question; last I heard there was a
       half-million dollar theft (google 'bitcoin theft' for articles).

       David Williamson: If this is what decides whether or not a currency
       is "working", then I recommend this story about the theft of $6.6
       billion worth of $100 bills:

       We have a [26]recent paper that discusses incentives issues in
       Bitcoin. Maybe some of you will find it interesting.

       since that "theft", the developers have reacted and the bitcoin
       wallet's private keys in the standard client are encrypted and
       hence protected by a password. without those private keys, an
       attacker can only know how many bitcoins you probably have, but not
       issue any transactions!

       @Jeffe, volatility is to be expected. The currency is working as it
       was designed. Bitcoin is used every day, it has a multi-million
       "market cap", and it has held up to attacks for a couple years now.
       I'd say it's doing better than okay.

       How many transactions with what total worth does Bitcoin do in a
       year? In 2009 VISA had over 60 billion transactions for a total
       value of over 4 trillion dollars. At the current value of a
       Bitcoin, the total worth of the entire currency is around $20
       million, right?

       Worth $30 per coin in June versus $3 per coin now is more than
       "volatility" that "is to be expected" unless you are the German
       Papiermark in the early 1920s.

       You're being shortsighted. People have been trying to make a
       decentralized virtual currency for decades. Things are possible
       (and happening!) now that were impossible before. That's what I
       call success in this case. Though I suppose it is subjective, and
       if being worth billions is your definition of success, I concede
       that it isn't there yet.

       Timothy Lee doesn't know what he's talking about.
       Bitcoin price volatility is only b/c it holds such great promise
       that speculators ran it up and crashed it also. But that has
       nothing to do with how well the currency is functioning. its
       impenetrable.

       ----
       How much volume did VISA do in it's 3rd year? Looking at
       bitcoincharts.com I see there have been $1M worth of transactions
       in the last 24 hours. Granted Bitcoin transactions are so much
       easier and cheaper than VISA and that's going to pump volume. I'd
       never use a VISA to give my sister $20, but I would with Bitcoin.

       I think PayPal did around $100 billion in transactions last year.
       That might be a better comparison than VISA in terms of volume.

       VISA in its 3rd year is a useless comparison since there was a
       totally different financial culture at the time, it started in a
       very limited area, and things were being done on paper.
       $300M versus $4,000,000M seems like it was worth mentioning.

       How do BitCoins deal with inflation? That is, if people start
       making new ones, won't the currency rapidly decrease in value?
       The main approaches I've heard about to address inflation involve
       some sort of central authority. Which defeats the purpose.

       ---
       Bitcoins are produced to random participants in the network at a
       rate that is goverened by the network and software running it. This
       leads to an inflation rate currently of about 37% which will halve
       sometime in 2013 (really when a certain block number is reached).
       It will halve again a couple or few years later. The total BTC ever
       issued is likely to be about 21 million.
       Long term, if Bitcoin is successful, deflation will be the norm.
       Deflation isn't really a problem for Bitcoin because they can be
       spent in amounts of 0.00000001 (or less with software upgrades).
