   House Bill Targets Health Economics, Evidence-Based Medicine
   18 July 2012 5:22 pm
   [71]Comments

   A flat budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) isn't the
   only unpleasant surprise for research advocates in a House of
   Representatives spending bill released [72]yesterday. The draft bill,
   which reflects Republicans' desire to undo the 2010 health care law and
   trim the Department of Health and Human Services, would wipe out HHS's
   Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the main supporter
   of evidence-based medicine. The bill also bars NIH from funding
   economics studies.

   Approved today by the House Appropriations subcommittee on labor, HHS,
   and education, the bill holds NIH's budget at $30.6 billion. None of
   NIH's funding can be spent on "any economic research," the bill states.
   Howard Silver, executive director of the Consortium of Social Science
   Associations in Washington, D.C., says the provision appears to apply
   to long-running surveys on aging and retirement as well as research on
   health disparities and the costs of illness. "Any research where
   socio-economic status, wealth, or income are variables could be
   banned," he says. According to these NIH slides, NIH funded a total of
   [73]$194 million in economics research in 2009. "To outright ban
   certain research makes no sense," says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of
   legislative relations for the Federation of American Societies for
   Experimental Biology.

   Another directive would require NIH to certify to the HHS secretary
   that every grant it funds is "of scientific value" and will impact
   public health. That seems unneeded, Zeitzer says--it's what NIH's peer
   review process is for.

   The bill would also abolish the $405 million AHRQ, which funds studies
   of the value of medical treatments. The AHRQ-supported Preventive
   Services Task Force, an independent advisory group that evaluates
   screening tests and other methods of identifying people with disease
   risks, would be transferred to another HHS office.

   The bill also targets all HHS discretionary funding for patient
   outcomes research. As a result, the new Patient-Centered Outcomes
   Research Institute (PCORI) [74]created by the health care bill would
   apparently lose $150 million of its projected $320 million 2013 budget,
   says David Moore of the Association of American Medical Colleges in
   Washington, D.C.

   In addition, because the bill zeroes out the HHS Prevention and Public
   Health Fund, which was part of the health care bill, it would trim $787
   million from the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention, [75]according to the Trust for America's Health . The
   administration had [76]proposed drawing on this fund for $80 million in
   Alzheimer's research at NIH as well. If the bill passed, that research
   might have to be cancelled or funded by cuts elsewhere.

   Although lawmakers may introduce amendments to save threatened programs
   before the full committee meets to vote on the bill, the fate of the
   targeted items may not be decided until the House and Senate agree on a
   compromise bill later this year, Silver says.

            Last week's climate assessment report substantially
            strengthened an already highly confident scientific consensus
            and took a moderate line on some contentious points.
