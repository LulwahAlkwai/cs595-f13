Announcing the Evernote Accelerator

   Our driving goal at Evernote is to help make people smarter. That's a
   big mission, and we never planned on pursuing it alone. In 2008 we
   opened up the [130]Evernote APIs to developers to see what other
   smarts-enhancing apps smart people could build. It's time to take
   things further. We want to help developers build not just great
   products that work alongside Evernote, but great businesses that do,
   too.

   So this year, we're launching the [131]Evernote Accelerator. It's a
   one-month long residency program here at Evernote's headquarters in
   Redwood City, California. We're going to work with a small number of
   teams -- no more than six -- and do everything we can to help them
   build their ideas into successful products and businesses.

   IFRAME: [132]http://www.youtube.com/embed/V69ciUYSL-g?feature=oembed

   The Evernote Accelerator will serve as the culmination of our 2013
   developer program activities. The program started just a few weeks ago,
   at SxSW, when we announced the details of our [133]2013 Devcup
   competition to build great Evernote integrations. This year, in
   addition to awarding Devcup winners cash prizes and trips to San
   Francisco (for our third annual Evernote Conference), we will invite
   some of the best winning teams to our Accelerator program.

Work inside Evernote

   Our accelerator program is designed specifically for entrepreneurs who
   are using the Evernote platform. The developers here at Evernote will
   work with and advise the participants as they build their integrations.
   We're physically building the Accelerator workspaces now, right next to
   where designers and developers will be sitting. Working on a project in
   the Evernote Accelerator will literally be working inside Evernote. In
   addition to the general guidance any good accelerator provides, at the
   Evernote Accelerator you'll be able to get on-the-spot tactical advice
   from Evernote's own developers as you work on your project.

   The Evernote Accelerator will include a structured curriculum designed
   to help startups take their existing projects and make them into
   workable businesses. We'll be using a proven program that all the
   participants will go through together. To supplement that education,
   we'll be bringing in Evernote's friends and partners to host sessions
   on topics important to the startups in the Accelerator. We'll fine-tune
   these sessions as we get closer to the Accelerator itself, but topics
   likely to be covered include crowdfunding, hiring, working with mobile
   carriers, architecting for multiple platforms, and pitching. Some of
   these sessions will be open to the public, giving participants a chance
   to mingle with other cool people here in Silicon Valley.

   The Accelerator program will be intense. It will run for just four
   weeks, from October 21 to November 15. But that also means four
   weekends, and we'll have great activities to help the teams recharge
   and get some perspective while they're working on their projects. We
   are looking forward to working with teams from outside the Bay Area,
   and we love being tour guides here.

   As the Accelerator term concludes, we'll host a big, fancy event where
   the projects are shown off. Then, we'll help the teams move on to their
   next adventure by connecting them to investors, startup talent, or even
   other accelerators and programs that we regularly work with.

   To reiterate, the Evernote Accelerator will feature:
     * An intensive curriculum to help launch early-stage companies.
     * Workshops with Evernote engineers, designers, and business execs.
     * Talks and sessions with notable technology leaders.
     * A public closing gala where the new businesses are rolled out to
       the world.
     * Fun group activities in the San Francisco Bay Area.

When developers win, we win

   So how much equity do developers have to give up to join this
   accelerator? Zero. This program isn't taking equity in its participant
   startups. We want our developers to succeed, and when they do, Evernote
   will succeed with them. We look forward to actively supporting
   Accelerator projects by promoting them to Evernote's users through
   various channels, including our app store, [134]The Trunk. Once our
   participants are in the Accelerator, they're part of our family. We'll
   look out for them and help them grow.

   To make the program work for early-stage entrepreneurs, we will provide
   travel, housing, and office space inside the Evernote HQ to our
   participants, as well as Evernote's legendary daily team lunches in our
   cafeteria, and a stipend to cover additional living expenses.

   Here's how you get in: Learn about our API and cloud service, build an
   app (or service) that works with Evernote, and submit it to our[135]
   2013 Devcup competition. You must participate in the Devcup to be
   eligible for consideration for the Evernote Accelerator. (If you want
   to compete in Devcup but don't want to be considered for the
   Accelerator, that's cool too.)

Accelerator Partners

   The Evernote Accelerator, along with the rest of our 2013 developer
   programs, is being produced with the help of a few major partners,
   including DOCOMO Innovation Ventures and  the Honda Silicon Valley Lab.

   [136]DOCOMO Innovation Ventures is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTT
   DOCOMO. It runs a 10-billion-yen (about $100 million)  venture fund,
   and an incubation program to support startups, primarily in Japan. DIV
   is underwriting the DOCOMO Mobile Magic Award, which will go to the
   best mobile product created for the Devcup.

   [137]Honda Silicon Valley Lab is part of Honda R&D Americas. It's an
   open innovation lab for global Honda R&D focused on information
   technology. HSVL is behind the Honda Innovation Award at Devcup,  a
   transportation-focused prize for the best enhancements to the
   in-vehicle experience.

   The winners of these Devcup prizes will be considered for the Evernote
   Accelerator.

   The Evernote Devcup and Accelerator program is also supported by
   [138]Amazon Web Services, which is offering server credit to
   participating teams during the development portion of the competition,
   and to the winning teams to help keep their projects going after the
   2013 Devcup concludes.

   We are looking forward to building an international team of Accelerator
   participants. Evernote hosts hackathons and meetups around the globe.
   If you would like to meet Evernote developer folks and talk about the
   platform, the Devcup competition, working at Evernote, or the Evernote
   Accelerator, please come meet us at [139]one of these events.

   If you have questions about the competition for Evernote Accelerator
   positions or would like to participate in the program in some other
   way, contact me, [140]Rafe Needleman.
