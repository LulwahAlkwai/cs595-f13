   Video: The Costa Concordia is upright after a 19-hour process. Global
   National's Stuart Greer reports on the successful engineering feat

   Engineers declared success Tuesday as the Costa Concordia cruise ship
   was pulled completely upright during a complicated, 19-hour operation
   to wrench it from its side where it capsized last year off Tuscany, an
   unprecedented feat that sets the stage for it to be towed away next
   year.

   The submerged side of the Concordia suffered significant damage during
   20 months bearing the weight of the ship and the operation to right it,
   officials said. That damage must be repaired to stabilize the ship so
   it can be towed and turned into scrap.

   [86]Story continues below

   Shortly after 4 a.m., a foghorn wailed off Giglio Island and the head
   of Italy's Civil Protection agency, Franco Gabrielli, announced that
   the ship had reached vertical and that the operation to rotate it --
   known in nautical terms as parbuckling -- was complete.

   "We completed the parbuckling operation a few minutes ago the way we
   thought it would happen and the way we hoped it would happen," said
   Franco Porcellacchia, project manager for the Concordia's owner, Costa
   Crociere SpA.

   "A perfect operation, I must say," with no environmental spill detected
   so far, he said.

   2F55%2Fcosta0917.jpg&#038;w=670]

   Applause rang out among firefighters in the tent where the project
   engineers made the announcement. An hour later, Nick Sloane, the South
   African chief salvage master, received a hero's welcome as he came
   ashore from the barge that had served as the floating command control
   room for the operation.

   "Brilliant! Perfetto," Sloane said, using some of the Italian he has
   learned over the past year on Giglio preparing for the operation. "It
   was a struggle, a bit of a roller coaster. But for the whole team it
   was fantastic."

   The Concordia slammed into a reef off Giglio Island on Jan. 13, 2012,
   after the captain brought it too close to shore. The cruise ship
   drifted, listed and capsized just off the island's port, killing 32
   people. Two bodies were never recovered.

   The operation to right it had been expected to take no more than 12
   hours, but dragged on after some initial delays and maintenance on the
   vast system of steel cables, pulleys and counterweights that were used
   to roll the 115,000-ton, half-submerged carcass of steel upright. The
   final phase of the rotation went remarkably fast as gravity began to
   kick in and pull the ship toward its normal vertical position.

   Parbuckling is a standard operation to right capsized ships. But never
   before had it been used on such a huge cruise liner.

   raising
   [imgpress?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.globalnews.ca%2Fvideothumbnails%2F112%

   The Concordia is expected to be floated away from Giglio in the spring
   and turned into scrap. The aim was to right it intact, to prevent the
   leakage of potentially toxic waste into the pristine waters around
   Giglio, which is located in a marine sanctuary.

   Sloane said an initial inspection of the starboard side, covered in
   brown slime from its 20 months underwater perched on a jagged reef,
   indicated serious damage that must be fixed in the coming weeks and
   months. The damage he said was caused by the capsizing, bearing 20
   months of the ship's weight and the operation to rotate the ship.

   "We have to do a really detailed inspection of the damage," to
   determine how to shore it up so it can withstand towing. But Sloane
   seemed confident: "She was strong enough to come up like this, she's
   strong enough to be towed."

   Costa Concordia ship off Italy

   The starboard side of the ship, which was raised 65 degrees in the
   operation, must be stabilized to enable crews to attach empty tanks on
   the side that will later be used to help float the vessel away. Such
   tanks were affixed to the exposed, port side of the ship and were
   filled with water in the later phases of the rotation to help pull the
   port side down.

   The ship must be made strong enough to withstand the winter storm
   season, when high seas and gusts will likely buffet the 300-metre long
   liner.

   After receiving cheers, embraces and a kiss from his wife on shore,
   Sloane said he wanted to get some sleep, a beer "and maybe a barbeque
   tomorrow." He was later seen celebrating in a harbourside bar with
   members of the salvage team.

   "I think the whole team is proud of what they achieved," he said as he
   was mobbed by well-wishers and television crews, still wearing an
   orange life vest around his neck and carrying a South African flag in
   his hand, given to him by his wife.

   Helping the Concordia to weather the winter and stabilize it is an
   artificial platform on the seabed that was constructed to support the
   ship's flat keel.

   "The ship is resting on its platform," Gabrielli said.

   Sean Mallen explains below.

   F591%2FGTNH091613upright.jpg&#038;w=670]

   About an hour before the rotation was complete, observers said the ship
   seemed to suddenly settle down upon its new perch, with a clear
   brown-green line of algae drawn across its front delineating the half
   of the liner that had been underwater and the half that was exposed.

   Mayor Sergio Ortelli said the island felt a wave of relief as soon as
   the Concordia was freed from the reef in the initial hours of the
   operation. But he said there was also the realization that two bodies
   still have yet to be found, with a fresh search to be launched now that
   the ship is upright.

   "While there is happiness today, there is no triumphalism," he told The
   Associated Press.

   The Concordia's captain is on trial for alleged manslaughter, causing a
   shipwreck and abandoning the ship during the chaotic and delayed
   evacuation. Capt. Francesco Schettino claims the reef wasn't on the
   nautical charts for the liner's weeklong Mediterranean cruise. Five
   other Costa employees were convicted of manslaughter in a plea bargain
   and were sentenced to less than three years apiece.

   Costa is a division of Miami-based Carnival Corp., the world's largest
   cruise company.
