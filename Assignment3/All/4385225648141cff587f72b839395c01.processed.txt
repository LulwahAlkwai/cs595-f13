Cochineal: it's a bug AND a feature!

   So much [20]misinformation is being published right now about
   Cochineal, I thought a post that explains what it is, how it's made,
   why it's relatively harmless, and why I support labeling but oppose a
   ban, might be useful.

   What is Cochineal, anyway?

   Cochineal is, indeed, a food additive derived from an insect. Or, more
   properly, the stuff we call cochineal is a chemical extract of
   [21]carminic acid from the bodies of squished female scale insects.
   (No actual bug "parts" should be left in the dye.)

   [22]Scale insects look quite different from typical insects. Tiny, with
   no visible legs or antennae, they kind of look like plant pimples.
   [23]A cochineal scale is about the the size of a big-headed pin.
   Cochineal insects are a natural predator of prickly pear, and cover
   themselves in a white, fluffy wax.  Here's a link to their [24]proper
   taxonomic classification. They are NOT beetles.

   Why are these little insects so red under all that fluff? Eisner et al.
   (1980) determined carminic acid (the red dye) repels ants. This pigment
   may have evolved as a chemical weapon against predation.

   You can see a nice travel diary of how the insects are reared,
   collected, and then turned into dye in Mexico at the [25]Perfect Red
   site. There are a wonderful series of larger photos of the process at
   [26]Bugwood.  It takes about 60,000 insects to make one pound of dye
   (although estimates on that number vary widely!)

   Where is Cochineal used?

   On food and cosmetic labels, cochineal may have many different names:
   cochineal, carmine, carminic acid, Natural Red 4, or E120. You may be
   surprised where you find it-Campari, sausage, and artificial crab are
   some unexpected foods that use cochineal for more intense colors.  Many
   yogurts and juices also use cochineal, and most lipsticks and blushes.

   Is Cochineal safe?

   A few individuals may be allergic to the compounds produced by these
   insects, and improved labeling is a good idea.  The FDA reached this
   conclusion in a [27]recent document.  Some of the evidence that helped
   them reach that conclusion:

     "we identified three adverse events over an approximately 10-year
     period that involved products containing carmine or cochineal
     extract in which those color additives did not or probably did not
     appear on the ingredient list....We applied a reporting rate of 1
     percent to this figure to obtain our estimate of 31 adverse events
     per year."

   Note that the FDA is *estimating* the scope of the problem based on 3
   allergic reactions in 10 years. (If you're curious, you can find an
   very extensive world-wide list of adverse reactions to cochineal
   [28]here. It's not common, but it can be quite serious.)

   The FDA is mainly concerned with allergies in making their labeling
   decision, probably because cochineal has proved [29]non-toxic in lab
   tests.

   The FDA also recognized that some consumers might want to avoid
   eating/using products containing cochineal for non-medical reasons.
   (They did not actually use the words "squeamish" or "grossed out", but
   I sure read that between the lines of the report.)

   Therefore, the FDA decided the the benefits of increased labeling
   greatly outweighed the costs, and that more labeling was needed.  So,
   now all products containing cochineal need to say that, rather than
   just using the vague phrase "natural colors."  That's fine by me!

   What would it mean if we banned Cochineal?

   [30]CSPI has called for a ban on cochineal and carmine.  Our other
   choices for red dyes in our foods or cosmetics aren't very appealing.
   [31]FD&C Red Dye #2, derived from coal tar,  is a good example.
   (Artificial colors are given the prefix FD&C, or Food, Drug and
   Cosmetic Act, since that is the law they are regulated under.)

   [32]FD&C Red #40 is the most commonly used other red dye, and is also
   derived from tar.  (And, interestingly, [33]CSPI wants it banned too!)

   It would be a great thing if food had less processing, packaging, and
   added ingredients to make it look good.  (Teal Blue food is just Wrong,
   in my book.)  However, the likelihood of that happening in the US is
   rather low, alas.  So keeping cochineal in our range of choices gives
   us a relatively safe option for food and lip coloring.

   More important to me, Cochineal supports subsistence farmers in poor
   parts of the world. This insect is an important cash crop!  From an
   [34]NPR story about cochineal:

     "Even though a full pound of cochineal sells for just $1.30,
     harvesting the bug earns enough money to feed and clothe a whole
     family in the impoverished highlands region of Peru. An estimated
     40,000 Peruvian families depend on harvesting the bugs -- which
     belong to a class of scale insects -- to make a living."

   By not rejecting cochineal in your food or makeup, you get to not only
   support farmers raising their tiny pink cash-cows, you can connect with
   the rich history of this pigment.

   Aztec and Maya peoples of Central and North America used these insects
   to create rich red colors for textiles [35]for centuries.  After
   Europeans arrived, they excitedly adopted this pigment over their
   previous one-[36]also made from scale insects! I'll have to do another
   post just on the fascinating history of this pigment some other time.

   OMGBUGZINMAIFOODZ! YUCK!

   Actually, there's lots of actual bug parts in your food all the time,
   and the [37]FDA knows and approves of it.  Insects happen.

   It's part of living on Earth, and we just can't get things sterile, no
   matter how much we try.

   Why not join the rest of the world and start adding insects as a
   regular part of your diet? They are regularly eaten around the world,
   and are quite nutritious. Until the Western world decided that bottom
   feeding shrimp and lobsters were OK, and insects were nasty, nearly
   everyone ate insects as a regular part of their diet.

   Join me in celebrating a sustainable, low-impact protein source!

   Or, at least join me in not worrying about a tiny amount of bug-derived
   compounds in your food.

       Very timely. I was just telling my wife and sis-in-law about
       Cochineal yesterday. There are definitely a lot worse additive in
       food and cosmetics than a little bug juice. At least Carmine is a
       pronounceable word.

       We ought to have a bug recipe collection for those that like to get
       over themselves and get back to a good diet.
       Maybe you know, but I was also under the impression that the
       cochineal insects will slowly kill the host plant.
       You mentioned kermes which is/was original red used in Europe from
       a middle eastern scale insect, but there was also another bug based
       red dye that there is evidence of use going back even further - it
       has been [73]identified as the dye used to make a persian style
       carpet that is 2500 years old (The Pazyryk Carpet). "St. John's
       Blood" comes from the "Polish cochineal" and "Armenian cochineal" a
       pair of scale insect species in the Porphyrophora genus common in
       the Ukraine and Poland.

       And another primary alternatives would be annatto, which, IIRC, has
       rather worse (more common) allergy issues.

       I think that your explanation of the "FD&C" prefix might be in
       error. AFAIK, it means that the dye is approved for use in foods,
       drugs and cosmetics, as opposed to "D&C", which means that it is
       approved only for use in drugs and cosmetics.
       People ingest much larger quantities of foods than they do drugs or
       cosmetics, hence additives approved for the former have to be
       proven safe in significantly larger doses than those intended only
       for the latter applications.
    7. [78]January 13, 2009 - 9:30 pm [79]Bug Girl
       ktesibios-I agree, and you are correct.
       In fact, we both are correct-my FD&C explanation came from the FDA
       website :D

       I think I've seen these. Not only in The Tonto National Forest
       northeast of Phoenix, but IN Phoenix. Not just IN Phoenix, but on
       the cactus in front of MY apartment!!! I never looked closely. I
       just assumed that it was probably some type of fungus or possibly
       mold. Could you please do me a favor and comment on whether or not
       they thrive in Arizona? I would just plain love to blow some
       people's minds with this!!
   13. [89]January 14, 2009 - 9:22 pm [90]Bug Girl
       I think it's pretty likely that they'd live in AZ. Seems like the
       right environment!

       The incoming FDA regulations requiring cochineal to be listed on
       food ingredients is going to make a lot of vegetarians, Jews and
       Muslims much happier. (There's actually an argument that can be
       made that cochineal isn't a kashrut issue since it is completely
       tasteless but I doubt anyone will buy into that argument anytime
       soon given that the general trend among religious Jews in the last
       30 years has been to become more strict rather than less so).
   16. [95]January 15, 2009 - 5:00 pm [96]Bug Girl
       I agree that labeling is a good idea, Joshua.

       I posted my comment above because I moved from Arizona to south
       Florida last April. In retrospect, I should have just Googled. On
       the other hand, I very much appreciate the response.
       Here's a good link about Cochineal not just about in Metro Phoenix,
       but in general.

       Here's what The Agriculture & Natural Resources

       They do live in Arizona- our Presidio San Agustin del Tucson Park
       has a nice prickly pear with lots of cochineal wax on its pads.

       Have you been contacted by Campari yet? They just emailed me
       wanting me to reassure folks that Campari no longer contains
       cochineal. Stinko.
   20. [104]January 16, 2009 - 11:16 am [105]Bug Girl
       Well, that sucks! I thought it was only in the EU that they had
       removed the cochineal.
       I know that Ocean Spray pink grapefruit stopped using it a while
       back when people realized what cochineal was in the last PR blitz.
       :(
   21. [106]January 16, 2009 - 3:18 pm Chris P
       Well - interesting. I PERSONALLY have had at least 4 bad reactions
       to Cochineal/Carmine. On of those involved a trip to the emergency
       room to get atrial fibrulation fixed by having them stop my heart.
       This was after swallowing half a bottle of Fruitopia.
       Even a couple of pieces of pink liquorice allsorts will cause a
       reaction, The ingredient was not listed on the box but I later
       found one with a list of ingredients in German and it WAS on that
       list.
       Given that anaphylactic shock can be fatal and the carmine
       relationship is not well known it may be a more prevalent problem
       than stated.
       There is NO reason to have chemical coloring in food. It's stupid
       vanity. I now have to take a calcium blocker everyday just in case
       I eat something with it in. A waste of a dollar a day.

       I am finding it rather funny to see all tbe hysteria about this
       when cochineal has been added to foods and other things since way
       before there was "modern industrialised food manufacture".
       More than fifteen yrs ago I holiday-ed on the rather bleak island
       of [110]Lanzarote in the Canaries, where it turned out there had
       been a [111]thriving and economically important cochineal industry
       in the early 19th century. This supplied the dye to Europe, both
       for colouring Campari and for dyeing the red coats of the British
       army. The industry pretty much died out in the mid-19th century
       because cochineal was replaced by artificial dyes.
       Given cochineal's history as an "ancient secret of native people"
       (notably the South American Indian tribes) I would have thought all
       the usual idiots who rant on about wanting food to be "natural"
       would be loudly INSISTING on cochineal rather than nasty evil
       chemical "Red Dye #xz"
   24. [112]January 21, 2009 - 11:43 am [113]Bug Girl
       I agree-given the fad for things being "all natural", I would think
       cochineal would be more popular!
   25. [114]January 21, 2009 - 12:38 pm Chris P
       So are you guys advocating eating poisonous mushrooms and
       toadstools because they are "natural" too? There are plenty of
       natural things that are NOT good for you.
       Natural food afficianados would want minimal coloring. THe effects
       of cochineal on certain people have been only recently discovered.
       Like the celebrity who had mercury poisoning because he ate too
       much sushi things will change. Presumably some foods will become
       poisonous too.

       about what she had heard and held up the phone for me to listen to
       the taped news story. It's always nice to have the facts. Thanks to
       Doug Taron for linking to this site, which is how I found you!

       Labeling is great. I won't buy products labeled containing
       aspartame because I have questions about its long-term safety
       Banning, however, is not. I wouldn't presume to say that NO ONE
       should be allowed to eat aspartame just because I do not want to.
       EVERYONE has sensitivities to things. I cannot tolerate carrots - a
       bottle of juice that was colored with "purple carrot extract" set
       me off.
       We can't ban everything that anyone might possibly react to; there
       would be nothing left to eat.
       I really hope the hysteria about "We must get this banned!" does
       not grow in the future.
