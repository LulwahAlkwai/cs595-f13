   Ferrari 458: Now this is a great use of technology in a car. Let's
   actually assure it can go as fast as promised
   This might change my opinion of Ferrari. Most of the time their cars
   intimidate the hell out of me because I have no clue what all the damn
   controls on the steering wheel do. Well, apparently, on the new 458 the
   computer in the car compares the performance to design standards and
   automatically makes most changes so the car is optimized and the only
   controls you need to worry about are the gas pedal and steering wheel.
   I'm pretty sure I can figure those out. Check out the video on Motor
   Authority, really cool car:
