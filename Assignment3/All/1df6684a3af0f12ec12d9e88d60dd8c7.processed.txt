What You Need to Know About the Debt Limit

   [59]Amy Payne

   The Congressional Budget Office just dropped a budget update on
   Washington, and it's not good. The U.S. government is spending
   recklessly--and [60]Obamacare is adding fuel to the fire.

   The [61]new report comes at a crucial time, as negotiations over the
   debt limit are starting up again. Here are some basics to help you cut
   through all the political spin.

   What is the debt limit?

   Yes, it's the legal limit on federal government borrowing--but the debt
   limit is a [62]wake-up call. It's a chance for Congress and the
   President to stop the spending insanity.

   Why does it matter?

   Government spending is [65]accelerating with no end in sight as long as
   entitlement programs keep expanding.

   Entitlement spending is the biggest driver of skyrocketing debt. In
   only 10 years, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will devour half
   of the federal budget.

   Of course, Obamacare's new entitlements only add to this mess. Think
   health care spending is out of control now? "[66]Obamacare is the
   single biggest factor driving the growth in mandatory health care
   spending over the next decade," warns Heritage expert Alyene Senger.
   The insurance exchanges, the Medicaid expansion... it's all adding to
   our spending problem. (continues below chart)

   [67]BL-LTBO-2013

   What should Congress do?

   In a new Rasmussen poll, 58 percent of Americans "favor a federal
   budget that [68]cuts spending." Right on. Congress should [69]cut
   spending, reform these programs that are ballooning the debt, and put
   the budget on a path to balance within 10 years. Facing the debt
   ceiling gives them the opportunity to correct the catastrophic course
   we are on.

   President Barack Obama in White House press conference on July 5, 2011

   President Obama has made it clear he "will not negotiate" when it comes
   to ending the government shutdown. At last check, the nation's capital
   wasn't run by one branch of government, or even one political party.
   But President Obama is so intent on protecting his unpopular,
   unworkable, and unfair health ... [103]More
