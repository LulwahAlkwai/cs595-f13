Thanks for five great years

   When we launched Evernote into public beta in June of 2008, we had two
   crazy goals: create an external brain that makes everyone smarter, and
   build a hundred year startup.

   Five years is just the beginning. Whether you've been using Evernote
   for years or heard about us for the first time today, you're here at
   the start of the journey. Thanks for helping build Evernote.

   We're off to a good start!

   Evernote helped my wife and I plan the perfect wedding. Everything -
   including conversations with florists, pictures, and receipts - went
   into our Shared Notebook. "Check Evernote" became a frequent saying
   when we were meeting with vendors, guests and families.

   When I went freelance, Evernote become my go-to tool. I use it for
   client notes, managing projects, storing receipts, managing workflow
   with my assistant and more. I'm always on the road and have multiple
   computers/devices; Evernote is with me wherever I go.
   -- Kristi Wllis, Freelance Ambassador, US

   I am an avid home brewer. Evernote helps me make the best beer
   possible. Not only can I keep track of recipes, mathematical formulas
   and important facts about beer making, but I can keep detailed notes of
   my brewing process for all of my beers.

   Evernote was instrumental in helping me write three books. I used it to
   collect data, organize passages and search through the information I
   collected. With Evernote, I felt I could accomplish more. It's better
   than having a personal assistant!
   -- Mr. Soonsung Hong, Public Speaking Ambassador, Korea

   As a CEO, I'm faced with daily meetings and being on the receiving end
   of tons of ideas. I have two phones, two tablets and two laptops for my
   day-to-day work. With Evernote, I can take notes and create action
   items for every meeting, as well as manage my data seamlessly across
   all of my devices.

   Running a small business can be scary/ seem impossible at times, but
   Evernote has just made it so much easier.
