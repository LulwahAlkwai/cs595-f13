   NSF Tweaks Its Merit Review Rules
   9 January 2012 12:34 pm
   [72]Comments

   The National Science Board has made two subtle but potentially
   important changes in how grant applications are reviewed at the
   National Science Foundation (NSF). And while those procedural changes
   may seem relevant only to those hoping to win NSF funding, they also
   add to the never-ending debate about how best to measure the results of
   federally funded research.

   A new report from NSF's oversight body, approved last month,
   [73]attempts to clear up ambiguous language on how proposal writers and
   reviewers should interpret a criterion NSF adopted in 1997 asking
   reviewers to evaluate the so-called "broader impacts" of the proposed
   research. To help applicants and reviewers with what is the second of
   two criteria used to evaluate proposals, NSF guidelines currently
   provide eight examples of possible outcomes. They range from attracting
   more women and minorities into science to fostering ties between
   academia and industry. The list has become a de facto definition of
   broader impacts, in other words, a blueprint of the ideas investigators
   believe NSF is most likely to fund.

   That's a false assumption, says the science board, and one that imposes
   unnecessary restrictions on the creativity of investigators. Instead,
   the board stipulates that reviewers should use the same five metrics
   that they use to assess how well a proposal meets NSF's first
   criterion--the proposal's intellectual merit. The metrics include the
   significance of the idea and whether the investigator is qualified and
   has the resources to carry out the work.

   In its report, the board says the new language will give researchers
   more freedom:

     In the final analysis, NSB believes that the Intellectual Merit and
     Broader Impacts review criteria together capture the important
     elements that should guide the evaluation of NSF proposals. Because
     of the great breadth and diversity of research and education
     activities that are supported by NSF, the Board has decided not to
     recommend a specific set of activities related to Broader Impacts,
     just as it would not recommend particular types of research
     (emphasis added). Those decisions are best left to the PIs
     [principal investigators] to describe and to the NSF to evaluate.

   The second change addresses the thorny question of how to measure what
   "broader impacts" have resulted from the grant. Publication of new
   results is the widely accepted yardstick for the agency's ability to
   spot scientifically worthy ideas. But there's no such consensus around
   the second criterion. Some investigators believe NSF shouldn't be using
   the criterion at all, saying that it imposes an unnecessary burden on
   scientists already hard-pressed to obtain grants.

   While strongly endorsing the continued use of the criterion, the board
   throws a bone to its critics. The report says that it's not always fair
   to expect a researcher to show how his or her grant has met a societal
   goal such as broadening participation or commercializing a scientific
   discovery. The scope of the activity may be too small, or the time
   frame too short. Instead, it may make more sense to evaluate the
   success of a cluster of grants given out by an entire NSF program, or
   to examine the combined efforts of multiple grants at a particular
   university. As the report points out:

     NSB notes that assessing the effectiveness and impact of outcomes of
     these activities one project at a time may not be meaningful,
     particularly if the size of the activity is limited. Thus, assessing
     the effectiveness of activities designed to advance broader societal
     goals may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the
     individual project. Large, campus-wide activities or aggregated
     activities of multiple PIs could lend themselves to assessment,
     which should be supported by NSF.

   NSF hopes to put the new guidelines into effect in January 2013 as part
   of the next version of its Grant Proposal Guide. That will allow time
   for the agency to hold workshops for both staffers and the community on
   how the changes will be implemented.

   In the meantime, we'd like to hear what you think of the board's new
   approach to evaluating broader impacts. Is it a good idea? Will it
   change how you write or review a proposal?
