Types of questions for exams

   QUESTION: Give as many types of exam questions you can, give examples,
   and comment on if this is a good type of question.
   My answer below.
    1. A problem that some students can get right even if they never had
       the course because they have seen it in some other course. EXAMPLE:
       In a course on Ramsey Theory have a question that uses the Prob.
       Method. PRO: The question is still in scope for the courses. CON: A
       bit awkward that someone may have learned the material elsewhere.
       UPSHOT: This is FINE.
    2. A problem that some students can get right even if they never had
       the course because they are quite clever. EXAMPLE: Easy
       Combinatorics or Probability in a sophomore Discrete Math Course.
       PRO: The question is still in scope for the courses. CON: A bit
       awkward that someone may have missed class but still got it right.
       UPSHOT: This is FINE.
    3. A rigged question--- students saw two examples in class, two
       examples on the HW and now have to do one themselves. EXAMPLE:
       proving numbers irrational. PRO: Clearly in scope and fair. PRO:
       They will surely understand what you are asking for. CON: They may
       get it right via memory rather than understanding (they may not
       even know the difference.) UPSHOT: This is FINE though it requires
       some planning ahead of time.
    4. A rigged question with a twist--- students saw two examples in
       class, two examples on the HW and now have to do one themselves but
       its DIFFERENT in an important way. EXAMPLE: In class and HW do many
       problems like Here is the distribution, here is a random var, what
       is its expected value but on the exam give Here is a random var,
       here is what we want for the expected value, give a distribution
       that gives us that. PRO: Harder to memorize template. CON: May be
       hard to grade as they say odd things. CON: May be confusing to know
       what you are asking for, even for good students. UPSHOT: This is
       FINE though it requires some planning ahead of time.
    5. A problem that requires utter mastery of the material but no
       creative thought. EXAMPLE: Give the algorithm (that we did in
       class) for proving that a CFG's are in P. Write it up so that
       someone who had never seen it can understand it. PRO:
       Straightforward yet hard to get via memorization. CON: Might be too
       time consuming for an exam. CON: (From experience) no matter how
       much you say in bold letters things like Write it up so that
       someone who had never seen it can understand it. They will skip
       steps and write it up badly and its hard to tell if THEY really
       know it. UPSHOT: I do this but only in certain cases.
    6. A problem that requires them to be creative (this is ill defined
       but its the opposite of the one above). PRO: If they truly
       understand the material they can do this. CON: My PRO may be
       incorrect. UPSHOT: Absolutely fine for HW which are not worth much
       for the grade anyway and I can enlighten them. I tend to avoid
       these on exams. Though the line between creativity and standard is
       a thin one. (Problem for an exam: How thin in millimeters?)
    7. A giveaway question. When I teach Formal Lang Theory I have (going
       back to when I was Harry Lewis's TA in 1981) have on the exam Give
       an example of a string of length 4 over the alphabet {a,b}. An
       unintended consequence- if they CAN"T do this its a really bad
       sign. I have asked this question many times and I have literally
       NEVER seen someone get it wrong and pass the course. I have gotten
       the following answers: ab*, ababa, and a DFA recognizing aaaa (that
       I was tempted to give credit to but did not). Incidentally, the
       most common right answer has always been abab. Second is abba. PRO:
       I have this one early in the exam to calm them down.

   I try to ask some of each type on an exam. However, sometimes a
   question can be easier or harder than you intended, or be harder to
   grade then you thought, or not be in category you thought it would be
   in. The hardest line to draw is which questions are a matter of mastery
   and which are a matter of creativity? Another issue- some students can
   abstract better than others.
   When teaching a large course such as Sophomore discrete math (150-200
   students) I tend to get a uniform distribution skewed a bit on the high
   side. More precise: I tend to get at roughly 10 students in EVERY
   10-point interval: 0-10, 10-20, 20-30,..., 90-100, with less on the low
   side and more on the high side. The benefit of this is that the
   students who get (say) less than 40 CANNOT say Well--- everyone did
   badly. They really are send a signal to either work harder or drop (I
   tell them this directly as well). I don't understand profs who give
   exams where nobody cracks 50/100 (I have heard this is common in
   Physics). They are wasting half of the grade spectrum.

       A true/false math question where they then have to prove their
       answer. A student who picks the wrong answer can figure that out
       during the proof stage and then correct their answer. A student who
       picks the wrong answer and proves it has proven they really don't
       have a clue.

       Off topic: Why on earth weren't the call for papers for both STOC
       2014 and CCC 2014 published yet?

            If you google
            STOC 2014 the first relelvent hit (the second hit when I did
            it)
            goes to a webpage that has Topics/Call for papers- in
            paragraph
            form rather than list form so that may have confused you
            when you did the Google Search.
            The deadline is Nov 30. I do not know how much lead time they
            usually give.
            CCC I have not been able to find. Again, I do not recall what
            the usual lead time is so I do not know if this is unusual.
            BACK to my TOPIC- if you give a HW assignment where the answer
            can be found by Google, is it worth giving? YES if the point
            is to
            have them LEARN the thing they Google. NO if you are trying to
            test
            cleverness. The line is not all that clear.

       Bill, thanks. But Googling STOC 2014 does not give a call for
       papers for STOC 2014. It does give a one generic paragraph named
       "called for papers", but with no PC members, for instance.
       For CCC 2014, the situation is much worse. There's basically
       nothing.
       I guess these conferences shoot only for the regular participants
       from about 20 research centers in the US (and some more from other
       countries), and so they don't feel obliged to even publish their
       CFP.

            Point well taken- the webpage that we both saw has something
            CALLED `Call fo papers' (they left out the r- maybe a bad
            sign)
            but all it is is a list of topics. No List of whose on the
            committee, or where/how to submit.

       #5 is just agony to place on an exam and not so helpful to students
       or teaching staff, much better for homework. All other questions
       are really helpful and they may help to give you the distributions
       that you are seeing. Have you ever checked if students who could do
       questions of type #6 and all other questions were the A's, type #4
       and all other questions the B's, and so forth? Would be interesting
       to see, but that's what my intuition would be.

            #5- asking them to write a (possibly long) proof or algorihtm
            so
            that anyone can understand it. When I have done this they are
            warned ahead of time (you will be asked one of the following
            three questions on the exam next week...) or I make it not
            THAT long
            a problem (you may assume Lemma XXX). Still hard to grade so
            never
            in a big class. In short- YES there are some issues, but it
            can be done right.
            The only trend I have noticed is that some of the
            bright-but-lazy
            students get the questions that don't require having gone to
            class
            but miss those that have. They don't do well in the end.

       I completely relate to your 7th type of question. Last semester, I
       encountered one on the final of my Theory of Computation class. The
       first question asked us to count the number of "l"'s (L's) in the
       string: "hello world". I was quite bummed to have spent an hour on
       the problem, only to learn afterwards that it was deemed "trivial"
       by peers. In the end, I got this problem wrong and failed the
       course, despite applying most of what I had learned:
       I first wondered if the generalized decision version of the problem
       (Given a string, a symbol, and a number, determine if #symbol <= n)
       was tractable or even decidable. I knew that it was not regular due
       to the Pumping Lemma, even when provided an ordering. Rice's
       theorem did not seem to obviously apply here. After trying various
       diagonalization arguments and failed reductions to the Halting
       problem, I convinced myself that the problem was likely decidable.
       The big hurdle was the abscence of a specified ordering on the
       input. Because of brain damage caused by a discrete math course, I
       cannot parse strings properly without error. I began by selecting
       arbitrary symbols of the input and checking for the presence of
       L's, individually. I was able to verify that there was at least one
       L present, but could not convince myself that L's found in
       subsequent trials were distinct from the first. I did discover at
       least 5 characters that were NOT L's.
       Since I had a lower bound (one L), I figured a good next step is to
       establish an upper bound. In a somewhat cheaty fashion, I used the
       knowledge that there are no more than 80, 12 pt, monospaced
       characters written on single line of a standard page. Since at
       least 5 of those are not L's, we have an upper bound of 75 L's.
       Though handicapped, I knew that the physical page layout preserved
       the ordering of the input. In my excitement, I folded the paper
       lengthwise, partitioning it into two sections. I wanted to properly
       sample this time, so I sought a good source of random bits. I asked
       the proctor to generate a random sequence of 75 ones or zeros for
       me. After chuckling, they audibly gave me one that consisted of all
       ones. Surprised, I accepted that low probability events do occur.
       Using this sequence, I randomly checked symbols from each section
       independently. Eventually, I found TWO distinct L's. This improved
       my lower bound to 2 L's.
       To avoid tearing, I chose not to fold it further. I requested blank
       paper in the hopes that I could use it to "compute" on the exam
       (computation is local, after all). After some involved folding and
       test runs, I believe I succeeded in creating a bizarre paper TM
       head that could parse the input for me. I used a single strip of
       paper that slid through the machine as a way of encoding the
       answer. Every time my machine found an L, I tore an extra piece off
       from that page. At the end of the computation, the number of torn
       pieces determined the number of L's.
       Time elapsed during the middle of my computation on the "hello
       world" string. I requested and was permitted an extra 5 minutes to
       finish. I rushed the process, frantically tearing pieces off my
       strip as I witnessed new L's. The proctor became quite upset at the
       sight of a student shifting around a complicated origami
       "sculpture" while tearing up a long strip of paper. Much to my
       objections and despair, the proctor violently pulled the exam and
       machine away. Through the shower of small bits of paper (including
       those from the test computations), I cried as I watched my creation
       get crumpled up in their hands. This very much has been the most
       traumatic and saddening moment in my life so far.
       I somehow managed to get a 2/100 on the exam, probably because of
       my lower bound. I guess I really don't have what it takes to do
       well in cs theory. Since the course is required for a degree, I am
       retaking it next semester with another instructor. I hear they
       prefer oral exams rather than written ones. Perhaps things will go
       better for me next time.
