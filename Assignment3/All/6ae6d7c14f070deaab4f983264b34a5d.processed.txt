[76]Scientific breakthrough: Physicists at CERN have recorded particles
moving faster than light

   [original.jpg]

   Looks like Einstein may have been wrong -- An international team of
   scientists at CERN has recorded neutrino particles traveling faster
   than the speed of light.

   According to [77]Reuters:

     Antonio Ereditato, who works at the CERN particle physics center on
     the Franco-Swiss border, told Reuters that measurements over three
     years showed the neutrinos moving 60 nanoseconds quicker than light
     over a distance of 730 km between Geneva and Gran Sasso, Italy.

     "We have high confidence in our results. But we need other
     colleagues to do their tests and confirm them," he said.

     If confirmed, the discovery would overturn a key part of Albert
     Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity, which says that
     nothing in the universe can travel faster than light.

   io9 spoke with James Gillies -- head of communications and spokesman
   for CERN -- about the team's results.

   "It's important to make clear that nobody is claiming a discovery, or
   any contradiction with relativity," explained Gillies. "The OPERA
   experiment has a measurement they can't account for, so they're opening
   it up for further scrutiny, and hopefully an independent measurement
   from another lab."

   The [78]OPERA experiment that Gillies is referring to is designed to
   investigate the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations, wherein elementary
   particles known as leptons spontaneously transmutate (or shift) from
   one flavor of subatomic particle (called muon-neutrinos) into another
   (so-called tau-neutrinos).

   Scientific breakthrough: Physicists at CERN have recorded particles
   moving faster than light S

   CERN provides the OPERA experiment with an energetic beam of pure
   muon-neutrinos. This beam travels a distance of 732 km to an
   underground lab in Gran Sasso, Italy, where scientists observe how many
   of the original muon-neutrinos have transmutated into oscillated
   tau-neutrinos. Shown here is the OPERA detector located in the Gran
   Sasso underground labs.

   All told, the neutrinos take just 2.3 milliseconds to make the trip
   from Geneva to Gran Sasso. But in the course of performing their
   experiments, the researchers in the OPERA Collaborative noticed that
   the neutrinos were consistently arriving in Gran Sasso 60 billionths of
   a second ahead of schedule, i.e. 60 nanoseconds faster than light would
   over the same distance.

   According to the BBC, Ereditato has referred to the OPERA team's
   findings as "an apparently unbelievable result," but after 15,000
   measurements the researchers' findings look surprisingly sound.

   "My dream would be that another, independent experiment finds the same
   thing -- then I would be relieved," said Ereditato. "We are not
   claiming things, we want just to be helped by the community in
   understanding our crazy result -- because it is crazy."

   "And of course," continues Ereditato, "the consequences can be very
   serious."

   The team has opted to [79]make their results available online, allowing
   other physicists to more closely inspect and verify their results, and
   will hold a seminar to discuss their findings. [UPDATE: The seminar was
   broadcast live from Geneva on September 23, and [80]here's our report
   on what the scientists said.]

   Want to know more about what neutrinos are? Read [81]io9's Field Guide
   to Subatomic Particles.

   Could this possibly lead to faster-than-light travel? io9's resident
   physicist, Dave Goldberg, [82]explains why that's not likely. (Sorry!)
   And here's Dave's cautious [83]take on this latest news.
