LikeThis (A Thesaurus-Based Search Tool)

What is the purpose?

   LikeThis is a new search tool to aid Principal Investigators in finding
   and learning about other research projects that have similar goals and
   objectives as their own. By entering specific scientific terms or
   accessing their own grant applications or grants and clicking on
   LikeThis, investigators will be provided a listing of similar funded
   projects and/or publications.

What are the features of LikeThis?

   LikeThis screenshot highlighting the new LikeThis link LikeThis is
   available from the eRA Commons home page under the Additional Links
   section along the right side of the page.  LikeThis has a dedicated
   home page that includes a menu bar with links to the latest news and
   announcements, tips and support, and contact information.
   Clicking on the LikeThis graphic on the main page provides access to
   the system.  Here is a brief summary of its features:
     * My Scientific Text tab

     * Provides a list of funded projects and/or publications that are
       similar to the scientific text that is typed into the Scientific
       Description / Scientific Aims field.
     * Power can be added to the search by including a Proposed Project
       Title.  The terms in this field are weighted 100% in the search
       criteria, thus helping to ensure the results you get are the
       results you want.

     My Applications tab
     * Accessing this tab provides a list of your previously submitted and
       approved projects that are in eRA Commons.
     * Clicking on the LikeThis link for each project listed uses the
       terms and information in the project as the basis for the search
       criteria.

     The Search Results: Search results are formatted into three easy to
   use tabs:
     * Funded Projects - a list of clickable projects that matched the
       search criteria.  Each result has a LikeThis Score, providing quick
       insight as to how closely it matches the search criteria.
     * Publications - a list of clickable publication titles, also scored
       based on the search criteria.
     * Scientific Terms - a list of terms and their corresponding weights.
       The more times a term appears in the submitted text or application,
       the higher its weight.

     Next Steps: What can you do with the search results?
     * The lists of Funded Projects are formatted with hyperlinks that
       link to [44]RePORTER where more detailed information about the
       project can be found.
     * Publications are formatted with hyperlinks that link to PubMed
       where the articles can be accessed.
     * Take it with you... search results can be exported as an Excel or
       XML file.

What are the benefits?

   LikeThis provides a powerful and integrated search tool in a user
   friendly interface.  With the ability to find similar projects and
   publications, Principal Investigators can more quickly and efficiently:
     * find out new ideas for research based on what NIH has awarded in
       the past;
     * see what NIH is doing in his or her area of interest;
     * use the information as a decision tool to determine if they need to
       come up with a fresh research idea; and
     * figure out in which study section his or her application should be
       reviewed.

   It is important to note that the searches take place in a secure
   environment, since the PI has to log in to eRA Commons to access
   LikeThis.

Who can use the LikeThis search tool?

   The LikeThis tool is available to Principal Investigators registered in
   eRA Commons.
