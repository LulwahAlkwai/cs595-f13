Are Wearables The Enterprise Future?

   [16]Leave a Comment Posted by [17]C. Silva on June 17, 2013

Glass Exploring, Badge Unlocked

   I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase my Google Glass Explorer
   Edition (XE) shortly before the Google I/O event this past month in San
   Francisco. No expense seemed to be spared in the on-boarding process. I
   arrived at San Francisco's swank Intercontinental Hotel at the
   appointed time and was whisked to the presidential suite by of the
   Google's Glass Guides - members of the Google team brought on for the
   express task of welcoming new Glass users and acquainting them with
   their new hardware.

   The scene was nerd-vana, studded with Google execs, tech luminaries and
   Valley big shots. The pomp and circumstance aside, the 45 minute, 1:1
   session I had with my Glass Guide was one of the most well-planned
   technology demos I'd ever taken part in, and I do these sorts of things
   quite often. That said, this sort of bespoke sales process won't scale,
   and the question on many peoples' minds is, "who's gonna buy this
   thing," and beyond that, "is this the future of computing?"

What It Is, My Man?

   After getting my Glass, I made an effort to wear them as often as
   possible and to expose as many people as possible to the experience
   when attending an event and speaking. Those who wore the device had
   comments that coalesced into four categories, here's what they said:
     * "I thought it did more." The Glass interface is a series of cards,
       not unlike Google's [19]Now service on Android smartphones and via
       the Google search app on iOS. While the device can gather data over
       an available WiFi connection you configure via your browser or the
       mobile app (forget about any network that requires a click through
       page or login, though) most of its functions need to be configured
       and customized via the same browser or a mobile application and
       things like GPS and calling are not native to the device, they come
       from your device - and do so better if it's Android device. Glass,
       on its own, is a very complex and costly peripheral for your phone
       or tablet, relatively useless as a standalone device.
     * "It costs how much?!" Yes, this is a beta device, yes Google had to
       underwrite the development of a hardware product from scratch and
       in doing both, it asked Explorers to pay a hefty sum ($1,500) to
       get on board early. When demoing the unit, I found zero users whose
       opinion of Glass didn't change when they heard the price. Their
       enthusiasm almost always faded to, "well, it's kinda cool," once
       they'd digested the investment needed to get their own contrast
       with what they were able to - or not able to do with it. This is a
       device that will thrive at a $200-$300 price point, no more.
     * Is there an X app for it? Everyone was most interested in what
       Glass could do, their wish list eclipsing its current capabilities.
       This isn't surprising for a new product, imagination is almost
       always more enthralling than the real thing. However the first crop
       of "apps" that was released shortly after I picked up my XE left me
       wanting more, a lot more. The Twitter app was something I was
       really looking forward to. When it arrived, though, what I ended up
       with was a flurry of information "cards" for some of the more
       prolific Twitter accounts I follow and a confusing process to send
       a tweet. In my experience, users have to create a Twitter contact
       and use the "send a message" command  to share a tweet.
       Confusingly, you can't use the "share" command which is reserved
       for Google+.
     * Can I take a picture? Wait, how do I take a picture... OH! It's
       hard to explain the intuitive nature of doing some things with
       Glass. One of them is taking pictures and capturing photos and
       video. It's a bit confusing the first time, as we're not used to
       using a wide-angle lens that captures what we're already looking
       at. There's no framing and no focusing something foreign to many of
       us who are used to thinking in viewfinder mode when shooting a
       picture. That causes a bit of dissonance for many users but once
       you get it you get it. The unobtrusiveness of Glass is its best
       asset and shows a lot of potential for how i might be used in the
       future, unfortunately this early in the game many parts of the
       Glass OS and commands get in the way of what should be
       a natural experience.

   creepy than with a smartphone. I think. Taken at Zoholics 2013

Should A CIO Buy 1,000 Of These now? No. Buy 10

   I think it's quite early to call this the dawning of the era of
   wearable tech. I firmly believe that we'll see more, better (in the
   battery department, hopefully) and cheaper tools come out in the next
   two years. I also think that the biggest promise for this sort of
   technology is in industrial settings. I was asked by my Altimeter
   peers, "what does this mean for CIOs; should they buy 500? 1,000?
   10,000?" My response, "they should wait until price comes down,
   function goes up and these get more rugged, then buy 10 and relegate
   their testing to process areas where a great deal of multi-tasking
   takes place."

   I can see huge implications for an ambient, unobtrusive data feed in
   medical applications, pick and pack workers using these for order and
   route information and first responders taking these into unknown
   locales to guide them amidst rapidly changing terrain. Do we need
   Glass? No. Fact is many of us carry smartphones but likely don't need
   them, either. With the advent of Blackberrys and Treos, we gained email
   and  some basic apps in our pocket and our expectations of productivity
   shifted. We'd all functioned fine prior, but our expectations of what
   work got done where re-calibrated. Quantifying the benefit, well,
   that's a bit more tricky and I've not seen too many widely applicable
   metrics. As more immersive devices like iOS and Android phones came to
   prominence, expectations shifted again. With app-rich devices and
   tablets, many of us work exclusively from a mobile device; it's become
   a device that can do x and y, not a device that makes us as do I want
   x or y. So let's give wearables a chance to come to prominence, the
   market will determine how much of a success these devices are for
   general users - I tend to think it's limited and the real story is in
   industrial apps - and not rush to calculate the need for wearables;
   that argument is a bit of a slippery slope, after all.
