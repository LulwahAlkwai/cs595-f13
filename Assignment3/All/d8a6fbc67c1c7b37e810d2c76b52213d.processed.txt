[17]Six finalists for the IBM SmartCamp Regional finals in Silicon
Valley announced

   Posted on [18]September 12, 2013 by [19]IBM Global Entrepreneur

   The IBM SmartCamp North America Regional in Silicon Valley was Sept.
   19th. Six smart startup finalists were selected to compete at the event
   in hopes of moving on to the IBM SmartCamp Global Finals in San
   Francisco next February.

   Here are the six startups that competed:

   [20]connectem-logo2 [21]Connectem has developed the first packet core
   platform designed to run in commercial grade servers. The packet core
   is the computer that processes mobile data traffic moving between
   mobile handsets, dongles and the Internet. This IBM PureFlex based
   packet core from Connectem can be delivered to carriers for 1/10th the
   cost. Connectem and IBM delivered the first ever production network
   pilot at a tier 1 carrier.

   Connectem has engineered their solution in such a way that the IBM
   PureFlex based core can be deployed in the carrier network without
   impacting the current operations. Using Connectem's software packet
   core, carriers can start implementing new business models and services
   on their operating radio network without putting at risk their current
   business. The company believes its technology is unique and to date has
   filed five patents related to its VCM packet core and functionality.
   Additional patents will be filed in the near future.

   [22]coriell-life-logo [23]Coriell Life Sciences (CLS) is building the
   technology infrastructure needed to bring the era of genome informed
   medicine to the clinic.  CLS offers three core products that create an
   ecosystem connecting sequence vendors, data interpretation experts and
   physicians in an "App Store" marketplace.  Combining safe storage of
   the more than 3 billion data points in a whole genome, secure and
   private data exchange and expert scientific interpretation, CLS is
   poised to usher in a revolutionary change in clinical decision support.

   Built upon 7 years of research and patented intellectual property from
   its launch at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, CLS is now
   market-ready with its first product - GeneDose.  With a single test,
   physicians will be provided with a simple report of a panel of drug
   results telling them which medications will work, which will be
   dangerous and in many cases what dosage would be most appropriate for a
   given patient based on their individual genetics.

   [24]Logo of Mindful Science [25]Mindful Scientific, a medical device
   company focused on brain health, is building diagnostic, monitoring and
   management solutions for concussion & neurologic / neurodegenerative
   disorders.

   There are nearly 5 million reported victims of brain injury each year
   in the US, with an associated $48B in healthcare costs. There is a
   critical unmet need for an accurate and objective solution that can
   rapidly assess brain status for patient and treatment management.  This
   is a high-impact area where few tools are available. The proprietary
   technology, the Halifax Consciousness Scanner (HCS), utilizes
   innovative methods in neuroscience to quickly & accurately measure
   brain status by passively measuring & internally analyzing brainwaves.
   The HCS is non-invasive, portable, and easy-to-use.  It is a
   revolutionary device designed to provide clinically relevant
   information at all stages of brain injury for potential use in
   treatment decisions to improve patient care & quality-of-life.

   [26]onfarm-logo [27]OnFarm is the first company to integrate disparate
   hardware, cloud, and spatial data into a single SaaS farm management
   system.  The unique technology integrates nearly any type of data from
   any provider; from real-time soil moisture data to weather data, to
   image data. Users access information through a cloud-based dashboard
   with advanced analytics and guidance that enables the entire farming
   organization to make better, more informed decisions resulting in
   immediate impact on farm inputs, productivity, and profitability.
   OnFarm allows farmers to have a single solution to monitor, plan, and
   make decisions to help reduce the friction of adopting and maximizing
   technology.

   [28]Logo of rifiniti [29]Rifiniti provides business intelligence for
   companies that want to optimize their office space and reduce costs by
   up to 50% while increasing occupant productivity. Most offices around
   the world are 50% empty at all times as employees are increasingly
   mobile. This inefficiency costs US companies alone up to $180B/yr.

   Their software-as-a service (SaaS) product, Optimo(TM), measures the
   effective utilization of offices while also tracking workflow and cost
   of occupancy. They use low-cost, off-the-shelf technologies and
   multiple data sets that is processed through their proprietary,
   patentable algorithms. Actionable information is provided to customers
   through an executive dashboard. The solution includes benchmarking and
   scenario planning, and makes recommendations for improvement that
   enables customers to continuously optimize to achieve significant
   savings.

   [30]toopher-logo [31]Toopher solves the password problem. The solution
   eliminates online fraud and identity theft by providing invisible
   two-factor authentication to internal and external users-- offering
   better security without the hassle entrenched in existing two-factor
   solutions. They use the location awareness of your smartphone to add
   another layer of security to passwords-- all without leaving your
   pocket. The security tool is one that users will want to use-- the
   future of mobility and security.

   Toopher breaks the security mold by going beyond simply
   authenticating-only logins, and adds authentication to every critical
   action. The solution can log users out when they walk away from their
   computers and lock down accounts when they are asleep.

     * What is SmartCamp?
       SmartCamp is an exclusive global program bringing together
       entrepreneurs, investors and experienced mentors who want to build
       a Smarter Planet. SmartCamp provides access to world-class advisors
       plus a direct route to seed and venture capital.
     * What is Smarter Planet?
       We are now moving into a world where we're getting to an Internet
       of things and devices and increasing instrumentation. We have an
       overwhelming amount of data that companies have to deal with. And
       that's another reality in a smart world - the need for new insight,
       new analytics, new intelligence to deal with this explosion of
       data. That's another angle in a smart world where IBM can help
       companies.
