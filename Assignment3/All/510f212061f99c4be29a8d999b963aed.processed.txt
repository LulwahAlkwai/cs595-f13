[120]Pigeons outperform humans at the Monty Hall Dilemma

   by Ed Yong

   Monty_hall_dilemma Imagine that you're in a game show and your host
   shows you three doors. Behind one of them is a shiny car and behind the
   others are far less lustrous goats. You pick one of the doors and get
   whatever lies within. After making your choice, your host opens one of
   the other two doors, which inevitably reveals a goat. He then asks you
   if you want to stick with your original pick, or swap to the other
   remaining door. What do you do?

   Most people think that it doesn't make a difference and they tend to
   stick with their first pick. With two doors left, you should have even
   odds of selecting the one with the car. If you agree with this
   reasoning, then you have just fallen foul of one of the most infamous
   of mathematical problems - [121]the Monty Hall Dilemma. In reality, you
   should actually swap every time - doing so means double the odds of
   getting the car. I will explain why shortly but if you're currently
   confused, you are not alone. Over the years, the problem has ensnared
   countless people, including professional mathematicians. But not, it
   seems, pigeons.

   Walter Hebranson and Julia Schroder showed that, after some training,
   the humble pigeon can learn the best tactic for the Monty Hall Problem,
   switching from their initial choice almost every time. Amazingly,
   humans who get similar extensive practice never develop the optimal
   strategies that the pigeons pick up. This doesn't mean that pigeons are
   "smarter than humans" as some news stories have claimed, but it does
   mean that the two species approach probability problems in different
   ways. We suffer because we overthink the problem.

   The Monty Hall Dilemma takes its name from Monty Hall, the presenter of
   a show called Let's Make a Deal, which involved similar choices. The
   dilemma became truly legendary when it featured in a column called Ask
   Marilyn in Parade magazine. When columnist Marilyn vos Savant, the then
   holder of the Guinness World Record for highest IQ, wrote the correct
   solution, she was inundated with complaints.

   [122]Around 10,000 readers disagreed with her, and wrote in to say as
   much (these were the days when trolls had to actually pay for postage;
   read the last letter in particular). Many of them had PhDs and many
   were mathematicians. Even [123]Paul Erdos, the most prolific
   mathematician in history, refused to believe this explanation until
   computer simulations proved beyond all doubt that always switching was
   the best strategy.

   The problem is that most people assume that with two doors left, the
   odds of a car lying behind each one are 50/50. But that's not the case
   - the actions of the host beforehand have shifted the odds, and
   engineered it so that the chosen door is half as likely to hide the
   car.

   At the very start, the contestant has a one in three chance of picking
   the right door. If that's the case, they should stick. They also have a
   two in three chance of picking a goat door. In these situations, the
   host, not wanting to reveal the car, will always pick the other goat
   door. The final door hides the car, so the contestant should swap. This
   means that there are two trials when the contestant should swap for
   every one trial when they should stick. The best strategy is to always
   swap - that way they have a two in three chance of driving off, happy
   and goatless.

   All over the world, people are spectacularly bad at this. We almost
   always stick or, at best, show indifference. Hebranson and Schroder
   wanted to see if other species would be similarly vexed. They worked
   with six Silver King pigeons and altered the game show format to suit
   their beaks.

   Each pigeon was faced with three lit keys, one of which could be pecked
   for food. At the first peck, all three keys switched off and after a
   second, two came back on including the bird's first choice. The
   computer, playing the part of Monty Hall, had selected one of the
   unpecked keys to deactivate. If the pigeon pecked the right key of the
   remaining two, it earned some grain. On the first day of testing, the
   pigeons switched on just a third of the trials. But after a month, all
   six birds switched almost every time, earning virtually the maximum
   grainy reward.

   Monty_pigeon Every tasty reward would reinforce the pigeon's behaviour,
   so if it got a meal twice as often when it switched, you'd expect it to
   soon learn to switch. Hebranson and Schroder demonstrated this with a
   cunning variant of the Monty Hall Dilemma, where the best strategy
   would be to stick every time. With these altered probabilities, the
   pigeons eventually learned the topsy-turvy tactic.

   It may seem obvious that one should choose the strategy that would
   yield the most frequent rewards and even the dimmest pigeon should pick
   up the right tactic after a month of training. But try telling that to
   students. Hebranson and Schroder presented 13 students with a similar
   set-up to the pigeons. There were limited instructions and no framing
   storyline - just three lit keys and a goal to earn as many points as
   possible. They had to work out what was going on through trial and
   error and they had 200 goes at guessing the right key over the course
   of a month.

   At first, they were equally likely to switch or stay. By the final
   trial, they were still only switching on two thirds of the trials. They
   had edged towards the right strategy but they were a long way from the
   ideal approach of the pigeons. And by the end of the study, they were
   showing no signs of further improvement.

   Monty_human Why is the Monty Hall Dilemma so perplexing to humans, when
   mere pigeons seem to cope with it? Hebranson and Schroder think this is
   a case of our own vaunted intelligence working against us. When faced
   with a problem like this, we try to think it through, working out the
   best solution before we do anything. This would be fine, except we're
   really quite bad at problems involving conditional probability (such as
   "if this happens, what are the odds of that happening?"). Despite our
   best attempts at reasoning, most of us arrive at the wrong answer.

   Pigeons, on the other hand, rely on experience to work out
   probabilities. They have a go, and they choose the strategy that seems
   to be paying off best. They also seem immune to a quirk of ours called
   "probability matching". If the odds of winning by switching are two in
   three, we'll switch on two out of three occasions, even though that's a
   worse strategy than always switching. This is, of course, exactly what
   the students in Hebranson and Schroder's experiments did. The pigeons,
   on the other hand, always switched - no probability matching for them.

   In short, pigeons succeed because they don't over-think the problem.
   It's telling that among humans, it's the youngest students who do best
   at this puzzle. Eighth graders are actually more likely to work out the
   benefits of switching than older and supposedly wiser university
   students. Education, it seems, actually worsens our performance at the
   Monty Hall Dilemma.

       It's not really a problem in logic, nor in conditional
       probabilities. It is a problem in mathematical modelling, as you
       say here: "The problem is that most people assume that with two
       doors left, the odds of a car lying behind each one are 50/50. But
       that's not the case - the actions of the host beforehand have
       shifted the odds, and engineered it so that the chosen door is half
       as likely to hide the car." One either models the actions of the
       host correctly, or one does not. The logic in each case is then a
       short and easy argument. As so often in life, it's getting your
       axioms accurate enough that matters.

       @1: au contraire, it's pure, simple logic. 1/3 of the time, you
       have picked a winner. 2/3 of the time, you have picked a loser, and
       the game show host then shows you which of the doors is the winner.
       You can either stick, and win 1/3 of the time, or switch, and win
       2/3 of the time. Mathematical modelling is not required.

       I read this paper a little while back, and I think it is a great
       example to add to the growing literature on non-human animal
       intelligence. Unfortunately, it's a bit of an unfair comparison.
       The pigeons ran the task something like 300 times per day,
       everyday, for the full 30 days. The college students only ran the
       simulation 200 times total over the 30 day period. Seems a bit of
       an unfair comparison to say that pigeons are more capable of
       figuring this problem out when they have had 9000 attempts to solve
       it. After that much repetition, I wonder if the college students
       wouldn't have gotten the idea as well. Maybe they still wouldn't
       have. Who knows.

       April 2, 2010
       @davem: you miss the point; you are taking too narrow a view of
       what a mathematical model is. The assumption you make about the
       host's motive, and therefore action, is the key. That's your model.
       The rest then is trivial. If you assume something different about
       his motive and therefore action, you'll come to a different
       conclusion.

       I think such a study shows the futility of trying to give a
       universal definition of `intelligence'

       I aced statistics...except for the probability section. I've never
       gotten it and I still don't, not even after reading this. However,
       as I remember this type of show, the options aren't 2 equal goats
       and a car. There are the equivalent of a live goat, a dead goat and
       a car. So sure you'd much rather get the car, and you have a 2 out
       of 3 (I take your word for it) chance of getting the car. But if
       you look at what you have, a live goat, vs the downside of
       switching, a dead goat, it makes sense to stick. At least you've
       got a goat. And you don't get to go on the show more than once.
       It's like that in life too. All those real life choices don't occur
       exactly the same way many times a day. A bird in the hand is worth
       two in the bush so to speak. It creates a blind spot in human
       choice making, but wisdom in the grand scheme.

       [...] computer simulations proved beyond all doubt that always
       switching was the best strategy.
       Excuse me for nitpicking, but I'm not sure the term "proof" is
       appropriate here, since this a mathematical, not a science problem.
       You prove a mathematical statement by deriving the statement from
       known theorems (and ultimately from the basic axioms). Examples -
       because that's what we're really talking about here - may serve as
       a hint towards the truth value (and of course counterexamples can
       demolish any universal claim), but don't constitute proof
       themselves. Here in particular a computer simulation necessarily
       runs only through a finite number of examples. You could modify the
       problem so that the best strategy is to switch only in x% of all
       cases (where x is sufficiently large), and computer simulations
       would likely mislead you.
       Admittedly, the last scenario may seem disconnected from reality,
       but that's the difference between science and math. ;-)
       I'm curious as to how the students "overthought" their task. Did
       they keep track of which buttons they pressed, which lit up and so
       on? I don't know how many iterations you'd need - now that's a
       problem where computer simulations would come in real handy - but
       at some point I'd think just looking at your previous successes and
       failures you should be able to figure out that switching is the
       better strategy (although I don't know if 200 runs are enough for
       that). Did they formulate a theory on how to best play the game?
       Basically I'm wondering if they actually approached the game from a
       thinking, analytical perspective or whether they relied on their
       intuition.
       Also, I thought Monty Hall was a topic in school math. So, had the
       student never learned (or forgotten) about the Monty Hall problem?
       Or did they know it, but didn't recognise it in the button pressing
       variant?
       Did Hebranson and Schroder ask the students about any of this?

       Just imagine there are two candidates, A and B. A and B both choose
       the same door. After the moderator picked one door A always stays
       with his first choice, B always changes his choice to the remaining
       third door. Now imagine you run this experiment 999 times. What
       will happen? Because A always stays with his initial choice, he
       will win 333 cars. But where are the remaining 666 cars? Of course
       B won them!
       Another illustration:
       Let us conduct the experiment with 100 doors! Now let's say the
       candidate picks door 8. By rule of the game the moderator now has
       to open 98 of the remaining 99 doors behind which there is no car.
       Afterwards there is only one door left besides door 8 that the
       candidate has chosen. Obviously you would change your decision now!
       The same should be the case with only 3 doors!

       Brad - At the end of the experiment, the students weren't showing
       any further signs of improvement though. I think their performance
       had hit a plateau.

       For those interested, Jason Rosenhouse has written a book about
       this, *The Monty Hall Problem* (Oxford University Press, 2009).
       Here's the Amazon page for it:

       In regards to `overthinking'. The idea here is that the humans had
       come to the conclusion that the choice did not matter. They had
       convinced themselves that there was a 50/50 chance of getting the
       grain, and therefore stopped really looking at new data. Or, (in
       regards to probability matching) they had come up with a better
       feel, but were trying to game a random situation. That is, they
       maybe thought that if they choose the less optimal strategy 33% of
       the time, it would somehow make them more likely to succeed.
       Lastly: You can prove monty hall using binary logic (Brute force
       all possible outcomes of the binary choices the contestant makes)
       and you can determine a strategy to win 2 in 3. The reason why a
       computer model is used to `prove' this to mathematicians, is
       because they were no doubt a little leery of accepting the proof
       that contradicted their intuition so strongly. But having a
       simulation repeat the test millions of times becomes increasingly
       hard to deny.

       Most decriptions of the Monty Hall Dilemma I have seen rely on an
       unstated assumption. That assumption is that Monty either will
       always show you the goat, or at least Monty showing you the goat is
       random and not related to whether you selected the door with the
       car. But what if that isn't the case. After all the original
       premise is pick the door you think has the car, not pick the door
       you think has the car, then I'll show you one of the goats and give
       you chance to switch.
       So, what if Monty is short on cash and wants to avoid giving away
       cars. If you pick a goat, he declares the game over, and you've got
       a goat, or maybe he'll give you a chance to trade your door for a
       curtain that has a sheep behind it. But if you pick a car, then
       Monty will show you a goat and try to get you to switch. In this
       scenario, switching is a guaranteed loss, and not switching a
       guaranteed win.
       In statistics terms the 2 variables, whether you picked the car,
       and whether you get to make a second choice are assumed to be
       independent, while that is never never stated in the scenario. If
       they are not independent then the statistical reasoning behind it
       is incorrect.

       It's funny: for me, the Monty Hall problem is like one of those
       figure/ground illusions, like the two faces and the vase, where
       sometimes I totally understand the solution, and other times I
       completely lose the insight. Maybe it's because I've had a few
       drinks.
   14. Michael Burkley

       Just a point of possible confusion if one is not familiar with the
       show. You wrote: "You pick one of the doors and get whatever lies
       within." To me that sounds like you get - immediately - what was
       behind that door. That leaves two doors unopened. The host opens
       one of them and, behold! a goat. If you don't see a car behind the
       door you've chosen then of course, you switch.
       That's not how the game works, of course, but that's how it seems
       to be described in the article (at least to me).
       BTW, I would have stayed put...Oh well! Now I know better. It took
       me some time to work out the reasons, but now I understand. Thanks!

       In other words, pigeons are frequentists, humans are Bayesians (and
       bad Bayesians at that).

       @Jerry: "Most decriptions .. rely on an unstated assumption. That
       assumption is that Monty either will always show you the goat, or
       at least Monty showing you the goat is random and not related to
       whether you selected the door with the car." That's exactly what I
       meant by saying it all depends on your model of the host's
       intentions and therefore action. When I first tried to explain that
       point to a mathematician, he missed it entirely, cried "No, it's
       just mathematics", and damned near tried to hit me.
       @Lilian: "I aced statistics...except for the probability section."
       My memory of being taught introductory probability was that it was
       littered with unstated assumptions of the sort Jerry mentioned.
       That, and illogical use of English, managed to make the
       intellectually trivial contents needlessly demanding - but with the
       demand being placed on your ability to guess what your teacher had
       in mind, rather than on the theory.

       I suspect the difficulty arises from faulty questions. The car
       never moves. I think that the chances were always 50/50. There are
       not really three choices in the beginning because Monty knows where
       the car is and manipulates the outcome. Each of the two goat doors
       is equivalent and so can really only be considered flip sides of
       the same choice- the non-car choice. So from the outset the
       contestant only has two possibilities: to pick the car or the
       non-car flip side choice of a goat. 50/50. It reminds me a little
       of the "missing dollar riddle' where the wrong question is being
       asked, resulting in great confusion.
       What if we ask the correct question? "What are the chances of
       something there is never going to happen, happening?" One in three?
       Or zero? It will never occur that the contestant picks one door and
       then learns the result of that choice. It never really is a one in
       three probability because the choosing is prolonged through another
       step where the appearance of 50/50 is more obvious. But it was
       50/50 from the start.
       If Monty was in the dark, as well, and could not manipulate things
       we would see a very different outcome, were he to blindly open one
       of the three original doors and then ask if the contestant wanted
       to switch.

       Actually the pigeons learned to switch because their first pick
       never garnered any reward!!!

       What would happen if the pideons actually won a reward one third of
       their first choices as they should?

       To write a whole book about it. That's where they lost me... I'm
       with what XiXiDu says, as I am with what Charles is saying. It's
       not that complicated. It's logic. The car stays in the race,
       always. Pigeons aren't that complicated and apparently solely
       interested in the food (reward). Students might be not that
       interested in the `reward' at all. Comparing totally different
       factors and non-competing interests isn't great science /
       mathematics /o.w.n.

       The Monty Hall Problem is never explicit enough: is the prize moved
       (to the un-chosen door) when a booby-prize is revealed or is
       nothing is moved and the choice is still truly random?
       The remaining door should (if nothing is switcheroo-ed behind the
       scenes) be just as likely as the initial choice to have the prize
       behind it.
   23. Eva
       April 4, 2010
       It sounds to me like they did not offer the students enough trials
       or a good enough reward. If they are really there because it gets
       them bonus points in their psych class (my default assumption), why
       would they give a crap about how well they perform? I don't get the
       feeling that they were being offered something that was inherently
       valuable to them the way that food is valuable to a pigeon.
       Possibly if they run this test again with money or chocolate bars
       for the people I'll be less skeptical.

       Flip the point of view:
       First pick:
       your odds are 1 in 3 for the car, so host's odds are 1 in 3 for 2
       goats;
       your odds are 2 out of 3 for a goat, so host's odds are 2 out of 3
       for 1 car, 1 goat(!).
       Thus, 2 out of 3 times the host will choose the goat over the car
       and leave the car behind the remaining unchosen door.
       (Note, that if the host gives you a second chance only 2 out of 3
       times, then all bets are off.)
       (also, note tc @ 18.)
   25. XiXiDu
       April 6, 2010
       There really is no problem here. There is nothing to doubt either.
       It's logic. You don't need to simulate this, it's a self-contained
       truth. Your chance of picking the car first time is 1/3 but your
       chance of choosing a door with a goat behind it, at the beginning,
       is 2/3. Thus on average, 2/3 of times that you are playing this
       game you'll pick a goat at first go. That also means that 2/3 of
       times that you are playing this game, and by definition pick a
       goat, the moderator will have to pick the only remaining goat.
       Because given the laws of the game the moderator knows where the
       car is and is only allowed to open a door with a goat in it. What
       does that mean? That on average, at first go, you pick a goat 2/3
       of the time and hence the moderator is forced to pick the remaining
       goat 2/3 of the time. That means 2/3 of the time there is no goat
       left, only the car is left behind the remaining door. Therefore 2/3
       of the time the remaining door has the car.
   26. bargarhar
       May 9, 2010
       Preposterous. Unless the car is being switched, it is one door and
       one door only that has the car behind it. You either pick it or you
       don't, odds and chances are constructs of an imperfect species.
   27. JSR

       I think the family guy graph is labeled wrong (or the text
       describing it is wrong). The text says:
       By the final trial, they were still only switching on two thirds of
       the trials.
       But the graph shows switching at only about 1/3.
   28. Rob
       April 2, 2011
       Just came across this and noticed that the second graph you've
       shown is incorrect - it is incorrectly labelled as the human
       response, but actually shows data from the pigeons response on a
       second trial (where `staying' was optimal). The real results for
       humans show a shift toward the optimal strategy but only switching
       2/3rds of the time, as you describe in the text.
   29. Tony
       May 26, 2012
       In simple terms, you have a one in three chance of picking the car.
       No matter what happens afterwards, doors opened, not opened, offers
       made, not made, sky falls down, monkeys fly out of your butt,
       whatever...those odds NEVER change. They were 1 in 3 when you
       chose, and whatever else happens to the rest of the doors, your
       odds CAN NOT magically change to 1 in 2. Imagine if there were 18
       trillion doors, you have a one in 18 trillion chance of getting it
       right. Whatever someone does to the other doors, your odds are
       still 1 in 18 trillion if you stick. Don't we all wish we could buy
       a lottery ticket and instantly magically reduce our odds to 50-50
       that we would win a million dollars!

       Jerry nailed it above. When they asked Monty Hall himself about
       this, he laughed. He said he could get people to choose whatever
       door he wanted them to. He was under no obligation to open any
       doors.
