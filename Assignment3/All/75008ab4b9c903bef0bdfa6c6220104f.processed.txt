How to Cook up Your Own Social Priming Article

    1.  Come up with an idea for a study. Don't sweat it. It's not as hard
       as it looks. All you need to do is take an idiomatic expression and
       run with it. Here we go: the glass is half-full or the glass is
       half-empty.
       2.     Create a theoretical background. Surely there is some
       philosopher (preferably a Greek one) who has said something
       remotely relevant about optimists and pessimists while staring at a
       wine glass. Include him. For extra flavor you might want to add an
       anthropologist or a sociologist into the mix; Google is your friend
       here. Top it off with a few social psychology references. There,
       you have your theoretical framework. That wasn't so hard, was it?
       3.     Think of a manipulation. Again, this is nothing to get
       nervous about. All you need to do is take the expression literally.
       Imagine this scenario. The subject is in a room. In the glass-full
       condition, a confederate comes in with an empty glass and a bottle
       of water. She then pours the glass half full and leaves the room.
       In the glass-half-empty condition, she comes in with a full glass
       and a bottle. She then pours half the glass back into the bottle
       and leaves.
       4.     Think of a dependent measure. This is where the fun begins.
       As you may know, the dependent measure of choice in social priming
       research is candy. You simply cannot go wrong with candy! So let's
       say the subjects get to choose ten pieces of differently colored
       pieces of candy from a container that has equal numbers of orange
       and brown M&Ms. Your prediction here is that people in the
       half-full condition will be more likely to pick the cheery orange
       M&Ms than those in the half-empty condition, who will tend to
       prefer the gloomy brown ones.
       5.     Get a sample. You don't want to overdo it here. About 30
       students from a nondescript university will do nicely. Only 30 in a
       between-subjects design?, you worry. Worry no more. This is how we
       roll in social priming.
       6.     Run Experiment 1. Don't fuss about issues like the age and
       gender of the subjects and details of the procedure; you won't be
       reporting them anyway.
       7.     Analyze the results. Normally, you'd worry that you might
       not find an effect. But this is social priming remember? You are
       guaranteed to find an effect. In fact, your effect size will be
       around .8. That's social priming for you!
       8.     Now on to Experiment 2. Come up with a new manipulation.
       What's wrong with the glass and bottle from Experiment 1?, you
       might wonder. Are you kidding? This is social priming research. You
       need a new dependent measure. Just let your imagination run wild.
       How about balloons? In the half-full condition, the confederate
       walks in with an inflated balloon and lets half the air out in
       front of the subject. In the half empty condition, she
       half-inflates a balloon. And bingo! You're done (careful with the
       word bingo, by the way; it makes people walk real slow).
       9.     Think of a new dependent measure. Why not have the subjects
       list their favorite TV shows? Your prediction here is that the
       half-full condition will list more sitcoms like Seinfeld and Big
       Bang Theory than the half-empty condition, which will list more
       crime shows like CSI and Law & Order (or maybe one of those stupid
       vampire shows). You could also include a second dependent measure.
       How about having subjects indicate how much they identify with
       Winnie de Pooh characters? Your prediction here is obvious: the
       half full condition will identify with Tigger the most while the
       half empty condition will prefer Eeyore by a landslide.
       10. Repeat steps 5-7.
       11. Now you are ready to write your General Discussion. You want to
       discuss the implications of your research. Don't be shy here. Talk
       about the major implications for business, health, education, and
       politics this research so evidently has.
       12. For garnish, add a quirky celebrity quote. Don't work yourself
       into a lather. Just go to [6]www.goodreads.com to find a quote.
       Here, I already did the work for you: "Some people see the glass
       half full. Others see it half empty. I see a glass that's twice as
       big as it needs to be." - [7]George Carlin. Just say something
       clever like: Unless you are like George Carlin, it does make a
       difference whether the glass is half empty or half full.
       13. The next thing you need is an amusing title. And here your
       preparatory work really pays off. Just use the expression from Step
       1 as your main title, describe your (huge) effect in the subtitle
       and your done: Is the Glass Half Empty or Half Full? The Effect of
       Perspective on Mood.
       14. Submit to a journal that regularly publishes social priming
       research. They'll eat it up.
       15. Wax poetically about your research in the public media. If it
       wasn't a good idea to be modest in the general discussion, you
       really need to let loose here. Like all social priming research,
       your work has profound consequences for all aspects of society.
       Make sure the taxpayer (and your Dean, haha) knows about it.
       16. If bloggers are critical about your work, just ignore them.
       They're usually cognitive psychologists with nothing better to do.
       17. Once you've worked through this example, you might try your
       hand at more advanced topics like coming out of the closet. Imagine
       all the fun you'll have with that one!
       18. Good luck!

       I've been wanting to write an article like this for ages. I was
       thinking of researching whether people believe that something will
       happen "when pigs can fly", and submitting it to the Journal of
       Porcine Aviation Potential.

       Sounds like fun, Rolf, I'd like to try it. But I have a couple of
       questions:
       Why should I call this social priming? There's nobody else there to
       make it social, and it's all about processes that are happening in
       someone's mind, so shouldn't it be cognitive priming?
       Also, I have a limited research budget and I've been following your
       advice about only running 30 subjects. It finally worked, but it
       took me 17 tries. Does that mean that my first 16 attempts were
       wrong and I finally got it right? Does that mean I don't need to
       report the first 16 attempts? In any case, it turned out to be
       pretty expensive and time consuming because I had to run over 500
       subjects to get one study to work. I feel slightly cheated -- you
       made it seem so easy. Are there any shortcuts?
       p.s. I meta-analyzed the 17 studies and found no effect, is that
       bad, or did I just see so many half-empty glasses that I'm being a
       pessimist?

            You have a point there, Dave. The same goes for a lot of other
            studies labeled as "social priming." Maybe they should be
            called "environmental priming"?
            17 tries? Hmm, I based my recipe on the literature and there
            is no mention of multiple tries anywhere. So you cannot be
            right. Are you sure you did everything correctly?
            Depends on how those glasses got empty. Did you drink the
            contents?

            What is considered priming in this case? Apart from it being a
            stimulus providing semantic/embodied information I'm not sure
            what it means when you call it social priming.
            Since we can distinguish between subliminal, supraliminal and
            overt priming, priming simply equals providing information. It
            seems that social priming is often seen as unconscious (Bargh
            style) priming directly affecting behavioral outcomes. This is
            very much different from the embodiment-methapor example above
            in which often the outcome rather than the prime is social. If
            I would come up with a version for this I would defintely
            follow your guideline :)

            I always mess up recipes, it's probably my fault. I most
            likely used the wrong kind of candy in Step 4. Also, I
            probably should have pre-heated the oven, but the subjects
            kept complaining. I give up -- I think I'm going to switch to
            neuroscience.

            make pasta alle vongole only to find out that I should have
            ordered the vongole in advance in order to get fresh ones. So
            I made Thai chicken instead.
            Ah, neuroscience! The Walhalla of researcher degrees of

       Great article Rolf! I think you forgot a few intermediate steps
       though that go something like...
       - Realize that your results are not significant with 10+ different
       dependent measures.
       - Find significance in 2 out of 20 experiments.
       - Report on those 2 and disregard the others as if they never
       happened.

            literature of its own accord.

            Oh yes, you need some good yeast to get those effect sizes.
            I did once have a colleague in a seminar who said that "some
            manipulations worked and some didn't." When asked by the
            professor if his social priming experiments worked about "1
            out of 20" manipulations, he replied "yes" without any
            realization of the irony or why we all started laughing and
            staring aghast. *facepalm*

            Rolf,
            Ironically, your half-empty/half-full manipulation (3) has
            been used in what I consider to be one of the best, and most
            solid papers in Cognitive Psychology. See Experiment 1, 2, and
            3 here:
            http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/Sher&McKenzie2006Cognition.pdf
            My point here is that whether a specific manipulation or a
            dependent measure 'means' something, or seems 'smart' or
            'silly', depends on its role in larger theoretical frameworks.
            For me, the above 2006 paper is all the better because it
            makes a profoundly interesting and novel theoretical point
            using such simple and ingenious methods.

            Piotr, that's interesting. I agree with your point that the
            interestingness of a study depends on the context.
            Nevertheless, Step 1 seems to be an accurate description of
            many studies. As I've indicated in other fora, the main point
            is Step 7. These effect sizes are just unbelievable given the
            designs of these studies.

       Rolf, of course I understand that your main point is the
       implausibility of a large effect size given a tenuous, indirect and
       fragile relation between an IV and DV in many of these studies
       (hence social psychologists often use massive amount of statistical
       control). But, again, somewhat ironically, the effect size in Sher
       and McKenzie glass-half-full/half-empty Study 1, is over .8. If
       you'd like, I can give you many cognitive priming studies with
       similar effect sizes -- a feat often accomplished by controlling
       the heck out of the stimuli, presentation times, distance, etc. In
       short, the effect size itself is not grounds for suspicions, only
       in the context of theoretically vague and implausible connection. I
       think there is no disagreement there. But I wanted to chime in
       since I am getting tired of people 'reflexively' criticizing a
       study if it reports a large effect.

       Your own colleague Hal Pashler has a nice review on this, showing
       cognitive priming effects to be much smaller:
       http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.
       0042510. As he correctly points out, it is odd that social priming
       effects, which are much more indirect, should be so much bigger
       than cognitive effects. There is also this meta-analysis, which
       shows semantic priming effects to be between .10 and .30:
       http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11206202.
       Quite funny that I tried to make a parody and actually came up with
       something that makes more sense than the studies I was targeting.
