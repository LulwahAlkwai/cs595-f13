Program

   Sessions take place in room 308 of the CUNY Graduate School of
   Journalism, 219 West 40th Street.
   8:30 a.m. Continental Breakfast and Registration

   9 a.m. Keynote: Why Bioethics Matters
   Daniel Callahan, Co-founder, Senior Research Scholar, President
   Emeritus, The Hastings Center
   Thomas H. Murray, Senior Research Scholar, President, CEO, The Hastings
   Center
   Moderator: Mildred Solomon, president-elect, The Hastings Center;
   Senior Director for Implementation Science, Association of American
   Medical Colleges; Associate Clinical Professor of Medical Ethics,
   Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical
   School, and the Department of Anesthesia at Children's Hospital Boston

   From Shiavo to stem cells to synthetic biology, the public has been
   paying increased attention to issues in bioethics--both what happens at
   the bedside and what happens in policy. Each year, The Hastings Center
   receives hundreds of phone calls from writers covering science,
   medicine, health policy, and business, seeking answers to a wide range
   of questions about ethical issues. In the opening session, one of the
   founders of bioethics, Dan Callahan, will talk about its history and
   relevance. And Hastings Center president Tom Murray will talk about the
   interest in and need for a national conversation about the issues
   bioethicists tackle--and the critical role journalists play. The
   keynote program will help writers delineate a perspective: how
   bioethics is part of your story, and how to enrich a story by weaving
   in related bioethical considerations.
   10:15 Conflicts of Interest: Research and Clinical Ethics
   Doug Levy, Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs,
   Columbia University Medical Center
   Karen Maschke, Research Scholar, The Hastings Center; Editor, IRB
   Ethics & Human Research
   Ivan Oransky, Executive Editor, Reuters Health
   Moderator: Charles Ornstein, Senior Reporter, ProPublica

   Whether in research funding, physician prescribing, or scientific
   publication, conflict of interest is front-page news, and a core
   bioethics issue. Representative stories and cases will be discussed by
   attendees and panelists, and a framework for finding what counts as a
   conflict, and writing about it, discussed. One potential attendee, a
   medical writer, has already posed the hypothetical question, "Does your
   dermatologist have skin in the game?"

   11:15 a.m. Coffee Break
   11:30 a.m. Concurrent Sessions
   These presentations group together a range of bioethics issues around a
   particular theme. What do advances in medicine and technology mean for
   patients in the doctor's office, or in the hospital? What kind of new
   decisions do people face across their lifespans? These sessions will
   provide insights and story angles for journalists.
    1. Bioethics at the Bedside: Genetic Testing, Personalized Medicine,
       Organ Transplantation and More
       Alan Fleischman, Clinical Professor of Pediatrics and Clinical
       Professor of Epidemiology and Population Health, Albert Einstein
       College of Medicine
       Robert Klitzman, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Director,
       Master's of Bioethics Program, Columbia University
       Claudia, Kalb, Freelance journalist and former senior science and
       medical writer, Newsweek
       Moderator: Emily Laber-Warren, Director of the Health & Science
       Reporting Program, CUNY Graduate School of Journalism
       What are the bioethics issues patients and their physicians
       confront in the doctor's office or the hospital? This topic
       encompasses new developments in organ transplantation, the impact
       of genetic testing and personalized medicine, neuroscience and
       determination of death, and case studies from the field. Additional
       panel members will be announced.
    2. From Assisted Reproduction to Advanced Illness: The Circle of Life
       Michael Gusmano, Research Scholar, The Hastings Center
       Josephine Johnston, Research Scholar, The Hastings Center
       Robin Marantz Henig, Contributing Writer, The New York Times
       Magazine
       Moderator: Randi Epstein, medical writer, adjunct professor of
       journalism at The Graduate School of Journalism, Columbia
       University, and managing editor, Yale Journal for Humanities in
       Medicine
       This panel of two bioethicists and a veteran journalist will
       explore assisted reproduction, surrogacy, end-of-life care, and
       related concerns.

   1  to 2 p.m. Lunch [not included in Bioethics Bootcamp registration]
   Nearby dining options feature a range of cuisines and price ranges.
   Attendees will have an opportunity to consider practical ethical
   situations such as tipping and check-splitting.
   2:15 p.m. Emerging Biotechnology: Enhancement, Microbiomes, Synthetic
   Biology and More
   Gregory E. Kaebnick, Research Scholar and Editorial Director, The
   Hastings Center; Editor, The Hastings Center Report
   Andrew Revkin, Former New York Times environmental reporter and
   founder, DotEarth blog; Senior Fellow for Environmental Understanding,
   Pace University
   Rosamond Rhodes, Professor of Medical Education, Mount Sinai School of
   Medicine
   Moderator: Beth Schachter, Science Communications Consultant

   Moving beyond medicine, this session will cover emerging scientific and
   environmental issues. Topics range from synthetic biology to
   nanotechnology to new ways to grow food to robotic surgery. Two
   bioethicists and an environmental reporter will identify and explore
   relevant bioethical considerations.

   3:15 p.m. Coffee Break
   3:30 p.m. The Editors' Panel
   Jeff Kluger, Senior Editor, TIME Magazine
   Brendan Maher, Features Editor, Nature
   Jennifer Rainey Marquez, Senior Editor, Parade Magazine
   Ron Winslow, Deputy Bureau Chief, Health and Science, The Wall Street
   Journal
   Moderator: Susan Gilbert, Public Affairs Editor and Editor of Bioethics
   Forum, The Hastings Center

   TIME Magazine managing editor Nancy Gibbs wrote in the [16]Hastings
   Center Bioethics Briefing Book for Journalists and Policymakers, "A
   national discussion about what should and should not be permissible
   when it comes to making babies or curing disease or growing food
   requires a common language and honest brokers to guide the discussion.
   This is where bioethicists play a fateful role." In this panel, editors
   will reveal what bioethics stories grab them. How much do they want a
   bioethics angle in a science story? A policy story? Which topics do
   they see too rarely, or too often? By highlighting the range of media
   that care about bioethics, this panel can broaden your perspective on
   potential markets for your science stories. The panel concludes with a
   question-and-answer segment.

   4:45 p.m. Wine and Cheese Reception
   Following the formal program, panelists and participants are invited to
   socialize at a networking reception at the CUNY Journalism school. This
   concluding activity provides an informal opportunity for attendees to
   talk with editors and bioethicists who choose to stay, have more time
   with colleagues, and process the day's information. Wine and cheese
   will be provided.
