   By Lance Ulanoff2013-09-16 19:33:47 UTC
   Mashable Op-Ed

   This post reflects the opinions of the author and not necessarily those
   of Mashable as a publication.

   I messed up, big time. My own laziness resulted in the loss of well
   over one hundred drawings on my [48]iPad -- artwork I now must close my
   eyes and search my biological memory to see again. I could say it's all
   my fault, but I don't believe that's entirely true.

   You may be surprised to learn that I still own and use a
   first-generation iPad. It is my favorite piece of technology and while
   the fourth-generation iPad has surpassed it in speed, functionality and
   design, my iPad works perfectly and is in -- if I do say so myself --
   mint condition.

   It's not as though I've never tried another iPad. Sure, I've cheated
   with [50]Retina display test units and have traveled with the smaller,
   lighter and lovely [51]iPad mini. This does not make me an iPad lech.
   I'm simply a tech writer who wants to stay current. But I'm hesitant to
   give up my first iPad.

   In addition to browsing the web, accessing email, using social media
   and playing games, I use it to draw. I have a couple of go-to drawing
   apps: Autodesk's powerful [52]Sketchbook Pro and the social media
   platform-cum-doodling app [53]Doodle.ly. It's not unusual to find me on
   my couch watching TV while sketching something on my iPad.

Not a Perfect Existence

   A few years ago, I wrote about Apple's [54]crashing problem. You know
   the one, when you're in Safari trying to load a page or simply running
   an app and you get dumped to the home screen. While I think [55]Apple
   blames app developers for this, I'm not so sure. In any case,
   subsequent OS updates ameliorated the issue.

   Lately, though, my iPad had been slowing down. When I typed, the device
   struggled to keep up. Though my home network and Wi-Fi were faster than
   ever, web page loading was unbearably slow. Crashes had started to ramp
   up again, too. I started to think that I should back this baby up, wipe
   her and start over again.

   I used to regularly plug the iPad into my Windows 7 PC, but the PC had
   gone through a couple of significant issues and finally died earlier
   this year. When I bought a new Windows 8 system, I didn't even bother
   to install iTunes. What was the point? All of our [56]iPhones and iPads
   could update over the air. Since this was a camera-free
   first-generation iPad, I had no pictures to worry about. I didn't have
   any critical contacts or documents on my iPad. Any app I bought could
   be downloaded again. While I did not use iCloud to backup my iPad,
   cloud-based, far-flung servers still hosted my music, email and most
   documents (Google Drive, SkyDrive). What I created was in the cloud --
   at least some of it.

Broke My Own Rule

   You know where this is going. I didn't bother to back up my iPad, which
   shouldn't have mattered --until it did.

   One day, I was drawing in Doodle.ly. I love this app because you can
   quickly sketch a drawing or cartoon and then share it with the
   service's growing social network. People can then like and even reshare
   your doodle. When you complete a drawing, you can simultaneously
   publish to the network and share on your favorite social network (I
   chose [57]Twitter). The only problem: It didn't work. The app kept
   telling me the share failed. After a half dozen attempts, I gave up,
   sort of.

   First, I checked to see whether Doodle.ly was still authorized to share
   through Twitter (this is under Twitter's settings on the iPad). It was.
   It occurred to me, though, that the authorization might still be
   broken.

   Some weeks ago, as part of a sweeping security measure, I de-authorized
   a bunch of apps. Even after reauthorizing critical ones, they were not
   all properly posting to Twitter. The go-to fix was uninstalling and
   reinstalling Twitter. As I'm sure you know, removing an app, even
   Twitter, from any iOS device is easy. Just hold down on the icon until
   the black "x" appears and then select that "x" to delete. You'll get a
   warning about all the lost data, but nothing of importance is stored
   locally in Twitter.

   Next, I tried to reinstall Twitter. I found the permanent Twitter icon
   under iOS's General settings, selected it and then hit the Install
   button. The Twitter icon instantly appeared on my iPad screen and the
   installation began.

   It got three-quarters of the way through and then stalled for 10
   minutes.

Second Big Mistake

   Staring at the frozen blue installation bar, I tried to discern if it
   was moving at all. Nope; it seemed stuck. Nearly 20 minutes in, I gave
   up and held down the sleep/power button. In my defense, I have done
   this before -- and I usually end up where I started. I assumed I'd be
   able to try and install Twitter again.

   No such luck.

   Regardless of how many times I restarted the iPad or how long I held
   down sleep/power and the home buttons (a good way to force a proper
   reboot), the iPad was stuck in an infinite loop of reboots to the
   glowing Apple logo.

   Online, I found instructions that matched my method of reboot and
   finally an Apple article that recommended a restore. To do so, you
   connect the iPad to a computer with iTunes installed and then hold down
   the restore/power button and home.

What Restore Means

   Restore doesn't mean what you think it means. It's not a restoration of
   your product to its previous state; it's a factory reset. So it should
   be called Reset. It's not, of course.

   I connected my barely breathing iPad to my Windows 8 computer, which
   now had the latest version of iTunes installed, and did the hard
   reboot. On the iPad, I saw the "Plug In your iPad to the computer"
   graphic and instruction. On my computer, I saw instructions warning me
   that a Restore would delete all my data.

   I felt a cold chill run down my spine. While I had blithely dismissed
   the need for backing up my data, I realized that I had neglected to
   consider the hundreds of Sketchbook Pro drawings that resided not in
   the cloud or even a photo library backed up in Photostream, but in the
   app's own proprietary Gallery: portraits, cartoons, greeting cards,
   illustrations. All of it was gone.

   My predicament was untenable, yet also largely of my own making. If I
   had ever backed up the iPad or that app (or even exported all of them
   to the photo library), they might not all be lost. Granted, I had
   published some of the best on [58]Flickr, in print (as gifts) and even
   on [59]Mashable. Still, all the originals would be gone -- forever.

   Yet, I saw no other way. The iPad was not coming back on its own. So I
   restored.

From Scratch

   When the restore was done, my iPad was as fresh as a newborn baby, and
   about as dumb: No apps, no memory of any settings and certainly not a
   single file (app-related or otherwise) was left. The devastation was
   complete.

   As I tried to digest that fact that all my art work was gone, I began
   the task of rebuilding my iPad to its previous state. This proved
   somewhat more difficult than I expected.

   Setting up my Wi-Fi, adding my Twitter account and entering my email
   account(s) information went smoothly. Apps were another story.

   To reinstall my apps, I visited "purchased" in the App Store and began
   the rather laborious process of searching for and reinstalling my go-to
   apps . Sketchbook, my favorite app, installed without an issue (I was
   somewhat surprised that there wasn't an angry message on screen,
   waiting for me, when I opened it).

   However, I came across a surprising number of apps that I could no
   longer install: Google Drive, [60]Google Maps, Google Chrome (sensing a
   theme here) and Doodle.ly. Each one reported that it required [61]iOS
   6.0. No matter what I did, I could not find a way to install versions
   that would work with [62]iOS 5.1.1.

   When exactly did the iOS system fork so sharply that app vendors cannot
   provide one-version back of compatibility? If I really want to use
   these and other incompatible apps, I have one choice: Buy a new iPad
   running iOS 6 (soon-to-be [63]iOS 7).

   The reset didn't even help my old iPad's performance. It's about as
   buggy (or buggier) as ever. Safari crashes repeatedly and the
   performance is pokey at best.

   And when I look back, I have to wonder: Was I right about why Doodle.ly
   lost its Twitter connection and why wouldn't Twitter simply install?
   That's not all on me, is it? Is it?

   I can wonder, but like Walter White in [64]Breaking Bad, I set the
   wheels in motion. All that's followed since is, to be honest, mostly my
   fault.

   Pay heed to my tale of iPad hubris and woe, my friends. Even when you
   don't think you have to back up. You do. You really do.

10 Must-Have Apps for the New iPad Owner

    1. Air%2520video

[65]1. Air Video
       The iPad is a great media player. The size of the screen coupled
       with the quality of the display really makes it a great way to
       catch up on lots of content. Although you can use iTunes to
       transfer movie and music files to your iPad, converting and
       transferring can be a complicated and tedious process. This is why
       Air Video is so great -- it makes it extremely simple to stream
       video from your Mac or PC to your iPad.
       Just install the free Air Video server client on your PC, tell it
       what folders to watch or include and then fire up the app. Now
       select your computer and feel free to go through your lists of
       available content and watch it in great quality on the iPad! Air
       Video does a really terrific job of "live conversion," meaning your
       video is converted as it plays, which saves time and makes it
       really easy to enjoy your video collection on the couch.
    2. Real%2520racing

[66]2. Real Racing HD
       Real Racing for the iPhone was a great racing game. Real Racing HD
       is even better. The use of the accelerometer for turning and
       maneuvering might make you look a little weird to your friends, but
       the graphics, sound, controls and gameplay are all top-notch.
       Seriously, this is a great racing game and its a great game to
       really show off the power of the iPad!
    3. D98f1bb7

[67]3. GoodReader for iPad
       [68]We've written about our affinity for GoodReader both on the
       iPhone and the iPad in the past, but it bears a repeated mention.
       Simply put, GoodReader is one of the best document readers/file
       managers out there. Period. You can connect to Dropbox, Box.net,
       Google Docs, FTP servers, and local computers, and download files
       directly off the web.
       More than just a PDF viewer (though it is a great PDF viewer), the
       app can read a variety of different file types and can even let you
       open documents inside other apps to make editing a breeze.
    4. Double%2520discard

[69]4. Mondo Solitaire
       Mondo Solitaire was one of the apps we highlighted in our early
       [70]roundup of iPad video previews. In practice, the app is
       extremely addictive and extremely entertaining.
       Mondo Solitaire comes in two varieties, a pack of the most popular
       games or the whole shebang. If you like card games, we recommend
       getting the full package and then having a blast playing through
       tons of variations of Solitaire and Freecell.
       I have personally spent many hours playing Mondo Solitaire that
       otherwise could have been spent sleeping or being productive.
    5. 611577d0

[71]5. Wired Magazine
       Released earlier this week, Wired for the iPad has already [72]sold
       over 24,000 copies. For good reason too: Wired for the iPad is a
       great example of what publishers and content creators can do when
       they really fire on all cylinders.
       While we aren't sure if we would buy Wired every month without some
       sort of better subscription plan, the first issue, which includes a
       look at the making of Toy Story 3, is really worth checking out.
    6. 7b610069

[73]6. Kindle for iPad
       Apple's iBooks application is fantastic, but when it comes to
       content selection, Amazon still has the lead. Kindle for the iPad
       is a really good e-reader app, and makes it easy to browse through
       books. It seamlessly launches the web-based book store to make
       purchasing a snap.
       We think Apple has the edge in overall presentation, but you can't
       beat Kindle in price or selection. Also, while not as utterly
       beautiful as iBooks, Kindle for the iPad is still great to look at.
    7. 35354114

[74]7. Epicurious
       Even if you're like me and cooking consists of re-heating take-out
       and making reservations, there is something to love about the
       Epicurious app. There are so many recipes and ideas, not to mention
       gorgeous pictures, that this is a great app to have on hand before
       hitting the market or just to gaze at while waiting for the pizza
       delivery guy.
    8. Baf6e65b

[75]8. Dropbox
       If you are a Dropbox user, you owe it to yourself to get the Drobox
       app for the iPad. It brings all of what makes the iPhone app great
       and makes it even better. You can save content directly to your
       device, you can upload content off your device and you can view and
       playback media content all in the app.
       Dropbox is a great way to stay connected to the documents on your
       computer no matter where you are.
    9. Guardian%2520eyewitness

[76]9. The Guardian Eyewitness
       UK publication The Guardian released a really terrific iPad app
       that features its stunning photography. Visually, this app is one
       of our favorites. The form factor of the iPad makes it perfect for
       really enjoying and studying the art that accompanies news stories.
   10. 861e5753

[77]10. NewsRack
       NewsRack is our current pick as the best newsreader available for
       the iPad. It syncs with Google Reader seamlessly, so if you add a
       feed, it is added to Google Reader -- if you remove it, it's
       removed there too. However, you can selectively sync only certain
       feeds or categories, which can make news reading on the iPad more
       manageable.
       The iPad is a terrific way to browse the web, and that includes RSS
       feeds. NewsRack is a top-notch app that also works on the iPhone,
       if you want to keep everything in sync across devices.
