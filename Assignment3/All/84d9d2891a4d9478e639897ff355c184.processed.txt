   NIH Promises to Improve Biomedical Research Training
   7 December 2012 1:30 pm
   [71]Comments
   [si-sally_rockey.jpg]

   NIH

   Sally Rockey, NIH deputy director for extramural research

   Reacting to a steep rise in the number of young biomedical scientists
   seeking scarce academic jobs, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
   plans to launch programs to prepare scientists for nonacademic careers,
   move students through their Ph.D.s faster, and bolster the pay of
   postdocs.

   NIH officials announced these plans yesterday at a meeting of NIH's
   Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD). It is a response to a
   [72]report in June on the U.S. biomedical workforce co-chaired by
   Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman, who believes NIH is
   training too many young scientists in a system that she calls
   "dysfunctional." The report itself did not recommend imposing any
   ceiling on graduate training, however, and report co-chair Sally
   Rockey, NIH deputy director for extramural research, said yesterday
   that "we did not say we should reduce the numbers" of scientists being
   trained because that would require a modeling study. But NIH agrees
   that training needs to be improved, she noted.

   Toward that end, Rockey said NIH is planning to [73]take the following
   steps:
     * Launch a grants program for institutions to develop "innovative
       approaches" to complement traditional research training, for
       example, by preparing young scientists for careers in industry or
       science policy. NIH expects to fund up to 50 grants over the next 2
       years in what Rockey called the "centerpiece" of NIH's efforts.

     * Require that every graduate student and postdoc supported by NIH
       work with their adviser on setting career goals through what is
       known as an Individual Development Plan. "We have to change the
       culture" so that investigators "are invested in the positive
       outcomes of their trainees," Rockey said.
     * "Encourage" institutions to limit NIH support for graduate students
       to 5 years, with exceptions for family leave or if a mentor dies.
     * Raise the starting postdoc stipend from $39,000 to $42,000 as soon
       as next year, and examine whether NIH needs a policy to improve
       postdoc benefits.
     * Increase funding for two types of grants aimed at giving young
       investigators independent labs quickly: "kangaroo" (K99/R00) grants
       that combine postdoctoral support with a research grant; and Early
       Independence Awards, which allow newly minted Ph.D.s to skip the
       postdoc and start their own lab.
     * Create a system to track the careers of all trainees, not just
       those on training grants. Graduate students will receive a unique
       NIH identification number now assigned only to investigators and
       postdocs. NIH will also "encourage" institutions to post online
       reports on the career outcomes of their trainees.

   The one recommendation from June that NIH is not following is to shift
   some graduate and postdocs from research grants to training and
   fellowship grants, which offer a higher-quality experience. That would
   have been "extraordinarily complicated to do," Rockey said, partly
   because training and research are separate lines in NIH's budget and
   also because almost seven times as many postdocs are on research
   grants. However, Rockey says the steps that NIH is taking will
   accomplish the same goals.

   Tilghman, who chaired a 1998 report that said the United States is
   training too many biomedical scientists, praised NIH's response to the
   June report: "This is the most attention manpower issues have received
   at NIH in my career," she told ScienceInsider. But she also told the
   advisory committee about her "cynicism" that institutions will fail to
   post the career outcomes of trainees on the Web and limit NIH support
   to 5 years because NIH is not requiring those steps. "Without the
   financial pressure to get people through in an expeditious length of
   time, I think we will be looking at data that looks just like this 10
   years from now," she told the ACD panel.

   NIH Director Francis Collins acknowledged Tilghman's concern that the
   plan lacks "real teeth." He and Rockey suggested that it may not be
   legally possible for the agency to force institutions to track down
   past graduate students. But it may be possible to make that a
   requirement for new trainees, he and Rockey said.
