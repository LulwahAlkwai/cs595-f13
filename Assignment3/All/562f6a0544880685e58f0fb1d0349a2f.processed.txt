   [48]Yahoo launched a video-viewing iOS app, Yahoo Screen, on Monday,
   the first major app launch from the company's 10-month-old mobile
   engineering office in New York City.

   The [49]app is a portal to content from Yahoo's video partners, which
   include ABC News and Martha Stewart, and to its growing portfolio of
   original content. In conjunction with the app launch Monday, Yahoo is
   releasing episodes from eight new comedy series, featuring the likes of
   Jack Black, John Stamos, Ed Helms and Cheryl Hines.

   They will be joined by a variety of licensed content, including 5,000
   clips from the last 38 years of SNL, which Yahoo [51]secured streaming
   rights for in late April.

   Yahoo is also announcing on Monday that it has signed a licensing
   agreement with Viacom, bringing clips from Comedy Central shows The
   Daily Show With Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report to Yahoo Screen. In
   October, clips from South Park will join the service as well.

   Though Yahoo specializes in short videos and clips, which are ideal for
   web consumption, its Screen app is designed to "feel like a lean-back
   TV experience," said Robby Stein, a former [52]Stamped co-founder who
   now heads up Yahoo's mobile engineering office in New York, in an
   interview with Mashable last week. Streaming video plays the second the
   app opens, as if you'd just hit the power button on your TV set.

   Content is organized into horizontal "channels," including rows for
   comedy, celebrity and sports. You can access content from each channel
   without leaving the home screen: Just swipe to the right to explore
   more videos.

   In addition to topical browsing, you can also search across videos. A
   search for "Obama" yields a screen full of clips from the AP, Reuters,
   ABC News -- and the list goes on. All videos can be shared through
   Facebook, Twitter and e-mail.

   Yahoo Screen will launch without ads. Bart Stein, another Stamped
   co-founder who now serves as product manager of emerging products and
   technologies at Yahoo, said the company is still "looking at the most
   engaging ad format[s] for Yahoo and our users over time."

   Several other features are also missing. Videos can't be saved for
   viewing offline, and unlike many of Yahoo's recently revamped products,
   no personalization capabilities are available. But Robby said content
   will eventually be more personalized based on past viewing behavior. An
   Android version of the app is also on the way, Bart said.

   In addition to the mobile app launch, Yahoo Screen has been
   [54]redesigned for the desktop in a format that closely resembles its
   mobile counterpart. Where a user would swipe or tap on the iOS app, a
   desktop user navigates with the mouse.

   "Yahoo is a mobile-first company now," Robby said. "We think about how
   products work on mobile devices first, and how they work on desktop
   second."

   The app is fast, elegant and easy to use, and seems primed for a much
   larger catalog of content. (We suddenly find ourselves wishing Yahoo
   [55]acquired Hulu after all.) Given the string of licensing deals Yahoo
   has signed over the past few months, it seems fair to expect more,
   though the company would have to overtake the likes of [56]YouTube and
   [57]Netflix if it wants to become the ultimate portal for video.

Top 10 Free Photo Apps for Android

    1. 01-pudding-camera

1. [59]Pudding Camera
       Pudding Camera has a wonderful visual interface. Scroll through
       little thumbnails and camera icons (rather than text lists) to find
       the filters and effects you're looking for.
       This visual UI is helpful, since the app itself is not entirely in
       English. The output resolution is full, so you'll be downloading
       and sharing nice big images after you're done snapping and
       filtering.
    2. 02-fxcamera

2. [60]FxCamera
       FxCamera has been my go-to Android photo app for a while now. The
       filter options get very granular, which is great if you're a
       control freak - not so much if you're hoping to whip out your phone
       and capture a fleeting moment. Still, the array of choices is
       impressive for a freebie.
    3. 03-vignette

3. [61]Vignette Demo
       Vignette's framing options and clean UI make it a standout app. You
       can combine the filter and frame choices for a variety of
       permutations. The downside is that the output resolution is small,
       at least with the settings we tried. That's convenient for sharing
       online, but you may not want to [62]document your entire life with
       these tiny pics.
    4. 04-little-photo

4. [63]Little Photo
       Little Photo packs a surprising UI punch. Take a pic and you start
       with the raw image. A translucent menu then floats over the snap,
       and you can scroll through your effect choices and preview them on
       the fly. Mix your effects, hit apply, and share at will. The image
       processing and output are impressive.
    5. 05-retro-camera

5. [64]Retro Camera
       Retro Camera is fun, slick, and has a very "[65]Hipstamatic" feel.
       You're not scrolling through lists of effects, but selecting the
       vintage film camera you'd like to shoot with. The UI then becomes
       the camera (with various additional options appearing as buttons
       and switches), and you look down into the view finder as you snap
       away. Photos are then "developed" in the preview gallery where you
       can scroll through your attempts in a handheld dark room and share
       them out via [66]Twitter, [67]Facebook, and "Electronic Mail" -
       whatever that is.
       In our testing, we had a few crashes, but not enough to detract
       from the fun value.
       There's also a [68]paid version with more cameras and features to
       choose from.
    6. 06-action-snap

6. [69]Action Snap
       Action Snap is a bit different from the others on our list. It has
       a handful of filters, but the selling point here is the ability to
       grab a sequence of images and stitch them together automagically.
       This is great for objects or people in motion.
       Set the automatic shutter interval anywhere between .01 and 5
       seconds (or a custom speed that you can control manually) and start
       snapping your moving target. The app arranges the photos
       sequentially into panels or a grid. The dead-simple interface and
       lack of bells and whistles means you can focus on your subject in
       motion.
    7. 07-world-of-photo

7. [70]A World of Photo (Free)
       A World of Photo is not your traditional box of digital filters.
       It's a social photo game with the potential to be a lot of fun
       and/or super creepy. Think of it as a mobile, photo-centric version
       of [71]Chatroulette.
       You can jump right in as a guest user or sign up for an account if
       you plan to play often. Wait to be "located" by another user (who
       will appear on the map in relation to you). Then it's up to you to
       snap a photo of anything (within the terms of use and common
       decency) and send it off to that user. The nice thing is that when
       you're ready to take a photo, it allows you to use Android's
       camera, or other photo apps you've already installed. I used
       Vignette to snap a photo of my coffee cup and send it out to "Guest
       8244." I assume he or she enjoyed it immensely.
       The recipient can comment or send feedback. When the exchange is
       done, the app locates someone else, and tasks them to send a pic to
       you. I received a horrifying photo of a giant insect crawling on
       someone's foot. Fun!
       The interface is still a little rough. I attempted to email the
       bug-foot photo to myself, but the message came through without an
       attachment, and the horror was lost to the aether. Still, it's easy
       to see how a little time spent playing with this app could lead to
       a lot of time spent playing with this app.
    8. 08-photo-illusion

8. [72]Photo Illusion
       This app doesn't actually take photos on its own - you'll need to
       access snaps from your gallery. Once you load them in, there are
       multitudes of effects you can apply. Some of them are a little
       goofy, but there's entertainment to be had with fisheyes and fun
       house-type mirrors. The above example uses a lomo filter and a
       mosaic pattern.
    9. 09-roidizer

9. [73]Roidizer
       Want Polaroid-style pics without fuss? Grab this free app. The user
       experience could not be simpler, and the results are impressive.
       Take your photo through the Polaroid viewfinder, watch it develop,
       and write the caption at the bottom in a variety of fonts. You can
       change the "film type" before or after you shoot, but the
       variations are simple and clean. Your pics are easy to save and
       share. The final resolution is decent, but not huge.
   10. 10-camera360

10. [74]Camera360 Free
       Last but certainly not least, Camera360 Free has a full buffet of
       effects, filters and styles to choose from, including a great
       tilt-shift option that is often lacking in other Android offerings.
       The UI has nice big buttons, and once you get into picture-taking
       mode, there are even more granular options to play with.
       Sharing is a little buggy, but if you're looking for a wealth of
       photo options to experiment with, Camera360 (or its [75]paid
       version) is a great choice.
