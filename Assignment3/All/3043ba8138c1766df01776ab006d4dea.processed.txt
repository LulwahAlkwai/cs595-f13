Genetically modified foods: asking the right questions

Problems with GM foods lie not in genetics, but in the structure of
industrial farming.

   A while ago, I read an article in Mother Jones: [23]GM Crops Are
   Killing Monarch Butterflies, After All. Given the current concerns
   about genetically modified foods, it was predictable -- and wrong, in a
   way that's important. If you read the article rather than the headline,
   you'll find out what was really going on. Farmers planted
   [24]Monsanto's Roundup Ready corn and soybeans. These plants have been
   genetically modified so that they're not damaged by the weed killer
   Roundup. Then the farmers doused their fields with heavy applications
   of Roundup, killing the milkweed on which Monarch caterpillars live. As
   a result: fewer butterflies.

   But that's really not what the headline said. The GM crops didn't kill
   the butterflies -- abuse of a herbicide did. It's very important to
   distinguish between first order and second order effects. The milkweed
   would be just as dead if the farmers applied the Roundup directly to
   the milkweed. And, assuming that the farmers are trying to kill weeds
   other than milkweed (which only grows at the edges of the field), the
   caterpillars would survive if farmers applied Roundup more precisely,
   just to the crops they were trying to protect. Is it safe to eat corn
   that's been genetically modified so that it's Roundup resistant? I have
   no problem with the genetics; but you might think twice about eating
   corn that has been doused with a potent herbicide. Do you wash your
   food carefully? Good.

   The article goes on to talk about corn that has been modified with the
   [25]Bt gene, which causes it to produce its own insecticide. [26]Bt
   insecticides are commonly used, [27]frequently by organic farmers, to
   control caterpillars. With genetic modification, the corn plant
   produces the insecticide itself: it no longer needs to be applied
   externally. But the world is full of plants that produce their own
   insecticide; we call them "poisonous," and we don't eat them, though
   they're just as natural as the plants we do eat. Milkweed is a prime
   example, as is tobacco (nicotine is a common insecticide). As a
   consequence of eating milkweed while they are caterpillars, Monarch
   butterflies are poisonous to birds, which have learned to avoid them.
   In the constantly shifting balances of evolution, insects are evolving
   resistance to Bt. The important question here, then, is whether Bt
   produced by modified corn and spread by pollen [28]is safer for Monarch
   caterpillars than more intensive applications of Bt. The answer isn't
   clear, though I'd be willing to go with the modified corn.

   There is nothing new about genetically modified foods. Plants have
   genetically modified themselves for billions of years, and humans have
   grafted and cross-bred plants for thousands of years. I have no doubt
   that it would be possible to breed Roundup resistant corn the
   "traditional" way. It would take longer, but it can certainly be done,
   just as surely as we breed antibiotic-resistant bacteria by
   indiscriminate use of antibiotics. There's nothing magical about what's
   happening. We could probably do the same to create corn that makes its
   own pesticide. Genetic modification is faster and more precise than
   cross-breeding, but that's really the only difference. Labelling GM
   foods is probably a good thing, but I'd be more interested in labelling
   all foods with the pesticides and herbicides that have been applied, by
   whatever means, genetic or otherwise.

   So, the story really isn't about genetically modified organisms; it's
   about industrial farming practices and second-order effects. (There's
   an all-too-brief nod in that direction at the end of the article.)
   Second- and third-order effects are certainly important: they're the
   consequences of our actions. But that's different from blaming the GMOs
   themselves. As Thomas Pynchon wrote, [30]"If they can get you asking
   the wrong questions, they don't have to worry about the answers." There
   is so much wrong with industrial farming practices that I suspect it's
   even in Monsanto's interest to focus attention on the genetics, rather
   than on the industry itself.

   Synthetic biology is an extremely important technique that will affect
   our lives in ways as diverse as our food supply, lighting (the
   [31]Glowing Plant), and medicine (can we create [32]bacteria that live
   in a diabetic's gut and deliver insulin as needed?). I am not so naive
   as to believe that all applications of synthetic biology are "good."
   It's easy to imagine unethical applications of biology: say, food that
   makes your slave labor energetic but docile and easily controlled. But
   that's no different from any other technology. As [33]Drew Endy said
   (and as I've quoted [34]elsewhere), we need to keep synthetic biology
   weird and creative. It's already in the hands of big corporations, but
   if all that comes from it is what big corporations want, we have
   failed. Likewise, if agribusiness can keep the public distracted with
   fears about Frankenveggies while ignoring the real issues in our food
   supply, we have lost.

   We have to be aware of the biology we create and the consequences of
   that creation. Every action has consequences, and not all consequences
   are bad. Weed killer itself is not a bad thing (I've used a variety of
   Roundup to get rid of a Poison Ivy infestation), nor are GMOs. But I
   find it hard to imagine any circumstances under which the
   over-application of weed killer is a good thing. It's clear and
   unfortunate that Roundup Ready corn creates the incentive to use weed
   killer indiscriminately, leading to abuse that the makers of that
   herbicide would like to encourage. But let's understand where the
   problem lies: it's not in genetics, but in the structure of industrial
   farming. If we don't, we're in danger of asking the wrong question. And
   then, the answer really doesn't matter.

     * Mylo_Abacus
       Yeah, GMO foods would now put everyone who uses Bt at risk by
       establishing an evolutionary pool of Bt that all creatures can now
       relate to as one associable mind. Shame on GMO; if these creatures
       develop the resistance then gardeners could lose their organic
       anti-caterpillar effectiveness.
          + mem_somerville
            Resistance was found first in conventional use, in 1994,
            before GMOs.
            [39]http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.en.39
            .010194.000403?journalCode=ento
               o Mylo_Abacus
                 Confirmed on that, yes, the article dates to 1994 and
                 makes mention of some insects already "resistant." More
                 distinctive would be if those creatures had been known
                 previously to be non-resistant. However, you would have
                 to pay $5.00 for the full report, although the price
                 seems right.
     * Rick Mason
       Actually the herbicides that Roundup replaced were much more toxic
       to the environment. Even more so in the case of the insecticides
       that were replaced with Bt corns.
     * RB
       There is also the issue that GMO seeds are patented and under the
       control of Monsanto or other corporations. Farmer must buy all
       their seed from Monsanto. Monsanto has enormous control over our
       food supply. Is this good?
          + Mike Loukides
            No, that isn't good. That's one reason I'm excited by genetic
            engineering projects (like Glowing Plant) that are outside the
            bounds of industrial agriculture. And, while the recent court
            decision about patenting human genes gives me some hope, I am
            not excited by the probability that gene patents will lead to
            the same insanity that characterizes software patents.
            However, appropriate use of patents is a different issue from
            the use of GMOs themselves.
          + RobertWager
            There are 60,000 different seed options in NA. Farmers
            continue to by GM seeds because they see (quote from National
            Academy of Sciences 2010 report: Impact of GE crops on farm
            Sustainablity in the US)
            "significant economic and environmental benefits"
     * mem_somerville
       The claims are full of misinformation in this arena. Another
       misconception: that you only use herbicides with GMOs. There are
       plenty of conventional resistant plants. So even if you banished
       GMOs tomorrow you might have conventional HR corn (or wheat,
       potato, or whatever) in the very same place the following day.
       Some people are also under the impression that only GMOs have
       patents and license agreements. Also not true.
       So you are quite right-the drama that's aimed at the wrong target
       (teh evil GMOz) is such an unfortunate "squirrel" for activists.
       I do resent the idea that farmers are just eager to overuse
       chemicals. Every spray costs them time and money as well as fuel.
       It's an oversimplification to say they are using it
       indiscriminately.
          + Mylo_Abacus
            ...
     * http://pdiff.weebly.com/ Pdiff
       While I'd agree with your general premise, you should clarify some
       factual errors:
       1) RR crops are created and sold by multiple companies, not just
       Monsanto. Yes, they are a big player, but they are by no means the
       sole operators here.
       2) Saying crops are doused with anything, particularly glyphosate,
       is misleading. Yes, they are sprayed, but products are expensive to
       buy and apply. Waste is not an option.
       3) The spraying also occurs well before tasseling or ear formation,
       so washing off the produce is not any issue for this type of
       herbicide use (there also is no RR sweetcorn that I'm aware of and
       I doubt you would find field corn, RR or not, appetizing).
       4) Milkweed also occurs within the field and it is the loss of
       these plants that is inferred to be detrimental to Monarchs.
       Preliminary research has shown the Monarchs may actually do better
       reproductively on milkweeds within the field, not field edges.
       Large increases in corn and soy acreage, in conjunction with better
       in field control, is the surmised problem.
       5) Lack of precision is not an problem. Herbicides are actually
       applied in many cases with great precision as most applicators use
       high resolution GPS to guide sprayers, control spray volume, and
       turn spray equipment on and off. See #2.
       6) The debate over whether Bt (plants or pollen toxins) are safe
       for Monarchs has been settled for a long time (it is safe).
       Comparisons with whole Bt, as used in organic production, are
       irrelevant as those Bt applications are unlikely to be used on
       Monarch habitat (milkweeds) and Monarchs are unlikely to come in
       contact with Bt in an organic corn field. Commercial organic Bt
       application, for example, is often done by hand to silking corn,
       ear by ear, with mineral oil.
     * Bob
       Do you know if the Bt in the corn gets into your body, or the body
       of the meat animals who eat it? If so, what does it do there?
       Those seem like some interesting questions...
          + RobertWager
            Hi Bob
            Here is the UN-OECD Consensus document answer
            The acute oral toxicity data on Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry9C, Cry3A,
            Cry1F, Cry2Ab2, Cry3Bb1,
            Cry34Ab1, and Cry35Ab1 supports the prediction that the Cry
            proteins would be non-toxic to humans.
            When proteins are toxic, they are known to act via acute
            mechanisms and at very low dose level (Sjoblad
            et al., 1992). Therefore, since no effects were seen in the
            acute tests, even at relatively high dose levels,
            these d-endotoxin proteins are not considered toxic to humans.
            Both the long history of safe use of B.
            thuringiensis and the acute oral toxicity data allow for a
            conclusion that these and other d-endotoxins pose
            negligible toxicity risk to humans.

          + Tomás Hluska
            To work as a toxin it requires three things - basic pH (human
            stomach has acidic pH), specific protease and specific
            receptor to bind to (human lack both). That's why it is so
            specific to only some insect. Thus it will act as any other
            protein, i.e. be degraded in the stomach.
     * Steph
       Here's a data visualization on the recent changes in the corn
       industry>> [41]http://flapjackmedia.com/2013/09/04/corn/ It
       includes graphs on GE implementation rates, corn yields, corn
       prices, corn uses, etc.
     * wial
       I think this article is a near miss. The problem is not the second
       order effects per se, but the fact all alterations in ecological
       fitness landscapes *always* have second order effects, because
       fitness landscapes are rubber sheets, and the more drastic the
       alteration, the more potentially violent to the whole landscape.
       Think of a stick poking that rubber sheet -- and if it happens fast
       enough it even creates ripples as the rest of the landscape works
       to adapt -- all of which can go very very wrong. And it affects
       human culture and economics too. The second order industrial
       practices are *part* of the fitness landscape and just serve to
       illustrate the point, and can't be considered separately except on
       a case by case basis. If not misapplication of roundup, some other
       thing will be harmful, nearly every time.
       GMO is basically bad math.
     * Tomás Hluska
       _It's clear and unfortunate that Roundup Ready corn creates the
       incentive to use weed killer indiscriminately, leading to abuse
       that the
       makers of that herbicide would like to encourage. *But let's
       understand
       where the problem lies: it's not in genetics, but in the structure
       of

       _I have no doubt that it would be possible
       to breed Roundup resistant corn the "traditional" way. It would
       take
       longer, but it can certainly be done, just as surely as we breed
       antibiotic-resistant bacteria by indiscriminate use of
       antibiotics._
       Exactly,
       all we need to do is apply small amounts of herbicide and the plant
       will evolve the resistance. Just as we see it with the weeds.
       _Labelling
       GM foods is probably a good thing, but I'd be more interested in
       *labelling all foods with the pesticides and herbicides* that have
       been
       applied, by whatever means, genetic or otherwise._
       Exactly my words! Otherwise will the labelling work only to scare
       customers.
     * Fran Murrell
       The question should be: Why are we using GM crops when the science
       shows that agroecology can double food production in needy areas in
       10 years, cool the climate and reduce rural poverty?

     * Obbie Z
       I'm surprised no one has discussed the bait-and-switch that's
       happened with GMOs. We were told they were needed to "feed the
       world" and advocates keep trotting out the example of golden rice
       (to supply more vitamin A or some such).
       But what we're getting in GMOs are not enhanced food quality, but
       "enhanced" ability to shower the landscape with pesticides (which,
       incidentally, are marketed by the same company making the GMO
       seeds).
       This actually contradicts another mantra of the GMO industry: that
       they would lead to "reduced pesticide use". Yet the most widely
       planted GMOs are specifically designed to tolerate INCREASED
       pesticide use.
