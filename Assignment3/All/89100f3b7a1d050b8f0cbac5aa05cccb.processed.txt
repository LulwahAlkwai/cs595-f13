iPhone 5S vs. iPhone 5C: Which Should You Buy?

   What's This?
   Apple-iphone-5c-vs-5s
   [47]Samanthamurphy
   By Samantha Murphy Kelly2013-09-11 20:44:14 UTC

   If you're looking to upgrade your [48]iPhone, it's the first time you
   have to decide between two brand new models: the [49]iPhone 5S or the
   lower-priced [50]iPhone 5C.

   We don't have the right answer to which you should choose -- it's all
   about picking what's best for your preferences, whether you're an app
   power user and crave more security features (iPhone 5S specialties) or
   want a cheaper option (the iPhone 5C would win here). The good news is
   both options are pretty solid.

   SEE ALSO: [51]iPhone 5S vs. the Competition

   Still, major differences exist between the two. The iPhone 5S and
   iPhone 5C are similar in size, but the casing on the budget 5C is soft
   silicon rubber rather than anodized aluminum. Plus, the 5C comes in
   brighter colors -- blue, green, yellow, pink and white -- while the 5S
   is more subtle in gray, silver and gold.

   But perhaps the biggest difference is the 64-bit mobile processor on
   the 5S, which has twice the performance of the iPhone 5C. If you're an
   avid gamer or app user, the 5S is your go-to. But then again, apps that
   take advantage of the full power likely won't hit the App Store for a
   while.

   The iPhone 5S also has a lot of incentive for mobile photographers. The
   [52]camera upgrades are significant, including a five-element lens, a
   larger sensor and more sophisticated image processing.

   Another neat feature is the [53]fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5S
   called Touch ID, which can replace the lock screen code. With the touch
   of a finger, you can bypass the log-in screen and even purchase items
   in iTunes. The sensor lives at the top of the touch home button. The
   iPhone 5S also touts a new CoreMotion API, which could lead to smarter
   health and fitness apps. If you live by those, the 5S sounds like a
   better option.

   However, the iPhone 5C is nothing to scoff at -- in fact, it's
   basically an iPhone 5 disguised in a fluorescent body. Sure, it comes
   with only a few upgrades -- including improved FaceTime and support for
   more LTE networks -- but it features virtually everything its
   predecessor had at a lower price.

   For a full look at how the devices compare, check out the chart below.
   Which do you think is the better iPhone for you? Let us know in the
   comments.
