US Energy Infrastructure Vulnerable to Cyber Attacks

   energy

   How insecure is our energy infrastructure? This Wednesday at the Black
   Hat conference in Las Vegas, security researchers are set to show off
   an exploit of a newly discovered vulnerability in a wireless sensor
   widely used in [21]oil, gas and water processing plants:

     The new research on wireless sensors found flaws in the way they
     handle encryption, Lucas Apa and Carlos Mario Penagos of security
     consulting firm IOActive Inc told Reuters.

     They said they could contact some of the sensors with radio
     transmissions from as far as 40 miles (64 km) away and alter
     pressure, volume and other readings. If the overall control systems
     act on those readings without a failsafe, the researchers said, they
     could permanently disable a pipeline or plant.

     The sensors typically cost $1,000 or $2,000 and are deployed in the
     hundreds or thousands at a single oil, gas or water processor. The
     researchers said the flaws were found in devices supplied by three
     of the largest vendors in the field, but declined to identify them.

   Cyber warfare is a real. Just because America hasn't been hit yet
   doesn't mean that it can't or won't be. Reasonable people can disagree
   about whether the NSA's data collection programs adequately protect
   Americans' rights, but they are only a part of the picture.
   Intelligence can give our government some insight on threats just over
   the horizon; it can also reveal weaknesses in adversaries' networks.
   Exploits like Stuxnet, also rumored to have been developed by the NSA,
   serve to strengthen our offensive capabilities. But defensively
   hardening our infrastructure is at least as important as the rest of
   our efforts.

   No time like the present to get started!

     * Thirdsyphon
       Before I got to the end of the article, I was already thinking that
       this exploit sounded remarkably similar to Stuxnet, which did a
       world of damage by subverting a humble (and theretofore
       little-known) Industrial Control System component manufactured by
       Siemens.
       I've always kind of hoped that the United States was secretly a
       dozen steps ahead of everyone else in this field, since software is
       one of our national specialties. . . and for all I know we are. But
       articles like this still make me nervous.
     * cubanbob
       One would hope but I rather doubt it. If the NSA could be
       compromised by a Snowden why would anyone assume infrastructure is
       more secure?
     * Corlyss
       I'm probably wrong to think this, but I'm a lot more worried about
       the bombing and strafing of cheap energy assets by the moronic
       Obama and his little green minions than I am about cyber attacks
       from outsiders equally unfriendly to American prosperity.
     * Thirdsyphon
       You are, indeed, wrong to think that. . . but the sheer amount of
       wrongness that you were able to compress into that single sentence
       displays a certain perverse virtuosity that one can fairly describe
       as being, in some purely technical sense, *right*.
     * crocodilechuck
       Contrary to the spin of the writer, the USA is the biggest
       cyberwarfare threat on Earth.
       Set a better example.
     * Corlyss
       Thanks . . . I think. I strive for economy and vividness of
       expression even when being wrong.
     * Corlyss
       Better us than the bad guys. We're the good guys, remember?
     * crocodilechuck
       Bad guys: that's YOU

From the September/October 2013 issue

[91]Beyond COIN

   Isaiah Wilson III: The ongoing debate about counterinsurgency tactics
   is beside the point: American military efforts will continue to founder
   so long as political goals and military tactics are mismatched.

[92]Missionary Creep in Egypt

   Adam Garfinkle: New adventures in America's faith-based foreign policy.

[93]Family and Faith

   Noelle Daly: We've long assumed that fraying families are a natural
   consequence of secularization. What if it's the other way around?

[94]On Decadence

   Charles Hill: Decadence may be an inevitable outgrowth of modernity,
   but it doesn't necessarily presage decline and fall. Liberty, properly
   understood as based on self-discipline, is the best bulwark against
   social and moral decay.
