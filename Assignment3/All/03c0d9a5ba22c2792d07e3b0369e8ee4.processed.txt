At Data Transparency 2013, Issa Confronts SEC's Stalled Progess on Open Data

   Last Tuesday at [6]Data Transparency 2013, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA),
   chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,
   announced a new investigation aimed at persuading the U.S. Securities
   and Exchange Commission to restart the [7]stalled transformation of its
   corporate disclosure filings from documents into open data.

   Rep. Issa at Data Transparency 2013.
   Issa's criticisms are an opportunity for the SEC to clarify its
   commitment to the principles of President Obama's [9]Open [10]D[11]ata
   Policy. It's also a lesson in the challenges of converting any complex
   area of government reporting from static PDFs with page breaks into
   open data--standardized, structured, and accessible to all.
   In 2009 the SEC began phasing in a [12]requirement for public companies
   to submit their financial statements (and related footnotes) in the
   [13]eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) structured data
   format, alongside the old-fashioned plain-text document versions of
   those financial statements. The SEC publishes the XBRL files on its
   [14]EDGAR website. The SEC's attempts at standardization and
   publication--the two fundamental steps of open data --should, by now,
   have brought benefits to the agency, investors, and public company
   filers.
     * Since structured data--with each element electronically
       identified--can be analyzed automatically, the XBRL requirement
       should allow the SEC to review corporate financial statements
       faster and use Big Data analytics to find errors and fraud.
     * Since structured data can be downloaded readily into databases and
       spreadsheets, the XBRL requirement should allow investors to make
       faster, better decisions.
     * Since structured data, as long as each element has an agreed
       definition, can be produced automatically by software, the XBRL
       requirement should allow filers' internal accounting software to
       create their financial statements automatically and submit them
       more easily.

   These three benefits exemplify the three promises of open data in
   government: better management, better public transparency, and
   automated compliance. Other federal agencies choosing to standardize
   and publish their reports--notably the [15]Recovery Accountability and
   Transparency Board in 2009 and the [16]FDIC in 2006--have achieved all
   three.
   But so far the SEC has missed all three opportunities, to the detriment
   of its own mission, investors' interests, and the compliance burden of
   the companies it regulates. On Tuesday Rep. Issa announced he had sent
   a [17]letter to SEC chairman Mary Jo White requesting answers and
   documents in each of these three areas. Here's Issa's letter:
   [18]Issa to White re SEC open data

   IFRAME:
   [19]//www.scribd.com/embeds/168830597/content?start_page=1&view_mode=sc
   roll&show_recommendations=true


   Rep. Issa is not alone in his criticisms. [20]Congressional
   appropriators, the SEC's own [21]Investor Advisory Committee, the
   [22]American Institute of CPAs, [23]Columbia Business School, and our
   [24]coalition of tech companies have all made the same points. But his
   letter provides the most detailed explanation to date of exactly why
   the SEC's attempt at open data has so far missed the benefits that the
   Recovery Board, the FDIC, and others have realized.
   [25][100534641-president-obama.jpg]
   Disagree with Issa? Ask the President.
   Moreover, on open data, the Republican Chairman of the House Oversight
   Committee is aligned with the Democratic President of the United
   States. On May 9, President Obama released his [26]Open Data Policy,
   which requires agencies to open all data they collect and generate. The
   SEC's corporate disclosure regime, taken as a whole, flunks all seven
   parts of President Obama's seven-part definition ([27]page 5) of open
   data.
   1. The SEC Spent $11 Million Double-Checking Financial Statements with
   Calculators.
   First, the SEC has missed its opportunity to use structured data to
   find and correct errors (primarily the responsibility of its Division
   of Corporation Finance, or "CorpFin") and accounting fraud (primary the
   Division of Enforcement's job) in the financial statements. Why?
   Because the agency has not tried to incorporate the electronic
   structure of XBRL into CorpFin's reviews of corporate disclosures. Nor
   has it (yet) deployed Big Data analytics to help Enforcement sift
   through financial statements for fraud.
   I'm accustomed to writing our Coalition's blog in the third person, but
   I must shift to the first person to explain a relevant backstory. In
   2009 I was an attorney in the SEC's [28]office of interactive
   disclosure. I interviewed lawyers and accountants working for CorpFin
   to learn how they review incoming corporate disclosures, particularly
   the financial statements, to find errors and confirm that accounting
   rules and the SEC's regulations are followed.
   As might be expected, CorpFin's reviewers need to verify that all the
   required items are present in the financial statements that the SEC
   receives. They must check the math of financial statements to see if
   any calculations are wrong. They also apply accounting rules. For
   instance, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S.
   GAAP), no "miscellaneous" line item should be greater than ten percent
   of the larger category it's in. If, say, "Miscellaneous Revenue" is
   more than ten percent of "Total Revenue," CorpFin contacts the company
   to request that it revise the financial statement and further break
   down "Miscellaneous Revenue."
   I was shocked to find that CorpFin's attorneys and accountants do all
   of this work manually.
   In CorpFin, the attorneys and accountants print each financial
   statement as a document, pile the paper documents on their desks, fill
   them with underlines, and tap away on plastic Texas Instruments
   calculators. They eyeball whether or not each required disclosure item
   is present, make a handwritten note, and then turn to their desktop
   computer and check a box (or leave it unchecked) in a Microsoft Word
   document. They use a calculator to add up the line items in balance
   sheets and income statements. They check mechanical GAAP principles,
   like that ten-percent rule, the same way--with a calculator. As they
   confirm that the math is correct and accounting rules are followed,
   they note each confirmation by hand and in the Word document. The Word
   document later becomes a review memo that goes to supervisors, who
   summarize all the review memos for their higher-ups.
   [29][calculator1.jpg]
   Our most sophisticated Enron detection device.
   It's easy to understand why this practice is wasteful. With financial
   statements now available as data, not documents, software could
   highlight missing disclosure items, the math mistakes, or any disregard
   of accounting rules automatically--in real time, as the financial
   statements are received by the SEC and CorpFin. The agency could even
   adjust its submission system to automatically reject financial
   statements with such shortcomings.
   Of course, not everything that CorpFin's reviewers do could be
   automated. They also carefully read each submission as a whole, and
   their experience helps them notice when some aspect doesn't match its
   context. They compare narrative portions of each disclosure form, like
   the Management Discussion and Analysis, with numeric portions, like the
   financial statements. Humans, for now, are better than computers at
   figuring out whether descriptive text and numeric facts are consistent
   with one another.
   But, five years ago, I estimated that about half of the reviewers' time
   was spent verifying and checking aspects of the filings that structured
   data could, and should, automate.
   CorpFin reports 448 full-time equivalents (FTE) in fiscal year 2012 and
   471 in 2013 (page 80 of SEC [30]fiscal 2014 budget justification).
   Judging from the division's total salary and benefit costs ([31]page
   [32]78) of nearly $91 million in 2012 and just over $103 million in
   2013, compensating these staffers cost CorpFin about $205,000 each in
   2012 and $219,000 each in 2013. Let's assume, very conservatively, that
   about one-quarter of CorpFin staffers' time is spent reviewing existing
   companies' disclosures, and three-quarters is spent handling new IPOs,
   confidential treatment requests, and rulemaking. (Anecdotally, the real
   proportion of CorpFin time spent on existing company reviews is much
   higher, especially as new IPOs have cratered since the 1990s.) Half of
   that review time, or one-eighth CorpFin's total FTE--56 FTE in 2012 and
   58.9 FTE in 2013--could be automated using structured data.
   The bottom line? The SEC spent $11.5 million last year and $12.9
   million this year on manual pencil-and-calculator labor that could, and
   should, be instant and automatic.
   Chairman Issa has asked Chairman White to explain why, "[r]ather than
   using the wealth of structured financial data it is already collecting
   to automate any level of review, the SEC continues to ask Congress for
   more money to pay for increased staff" ([33]p[34]age 3, emphasis
   added). Backed by the House Oversight Committee's power to request
   documents and information from federal agencies, Issa asks the SEC to
   brief his staff on how--and whether--the agency intends to "incorporate
   XBRL-formatted financial disclosures into its review process"
   ([35]page[36] 4, question 4).
   (The picture at the Division of Enforcement is not as bleak as at
   CorpFin. This year the SEC [37]announced that it will use structured
   data to spot anomalies in financial statements that might indicate
   fraud. But that project is in its early stages. No Enrons have yet been
   found. And it will not have an impact on the day-to-day reviews of
   corporate disclosures.)
   2. The SEC Has Never Tried to Enforce the Quality of Financial
   Statement Data, so Investors Don't Use it.
   Second, structured data hasn't made life any easier for investors. Last
   year, Columbia Business School [38]asked inve[39]stors whether they
   were using the XBRL versions of corporate financial statements. Fewer
   than ten percent were ([40]page[41] 61). The overwhelming reason? Data
   quality ([42]p[43]age 28). Investors are not certain that the data in
   the XBRL files matches the numbers they see in the old-fashioned
   documents that are submitted at the same time.
   (Remember, the SEC has not completely adopted structured data.
   Companies must file the old-fashioned form as a PDF or HTML document,
   and submit an XBRL file alongside it. The XBRL file contains a
   structured-data version of the financial statements and notes, but not
   the rest of what's in the old-fashioned form.)
   Investors' concerns are understandable. XBRL US has tracked over
   [44]1.4 million error[45]s in the structured data filings since the
   XBRL reporting requirement began.
   It's not surprising that a new reporting requirement--particularly in
   an unfamiliar format like XBRL--might have been hard, at first, for
   companies to figure out. What's surprising is that the SEC has never
   asked for a single correction, not even for errors that would have
   earned an instant reproof if they appeared in the old-fashioned
   document version. For instance, companies have flipped positive and
   negative signs on accounting line items--a very simple error, easily
   spotted and easily corrected--over 400,000 times ([46]t[47]able) since
   XBRL filing began in 2009. The SEC, in all its correspondence with the
   companies about other aspects of their filings, never asked for any
   corrections. Small wonder that investors distrust the data.
   Investors are calling on the SEC to finally start enforcing the quality
   of the structured financial data it has been receiving for four years.
   In July, the agency's official Investor Advisory Committee
   [48]recommended "active monitoring" of structured data ([49]page 3).
   The agency hasn't yet responded to the recommendations, though it is
   [50]required by the Dodd-[51]Frank [52]Act to do so.
   Chairman Issa asked Chairman White to explain why the SEC "has not
   issued even one comment letter [from the Division of Corporation
   Finance] on any of the more than 1.4 million errors identified"
   ([53]page 3). A bit of enforcement, even as a symbolic signal, would
   give investors more confidence that the SEC is serious about the
   quality of structured data submitted to it and encourage them to start
   using the data to make better, faster investment decisions.
   3. Unless the SEC Clarifies its Plans for Open Data, Investors and
   Companies Can't Plan for the Future.

   Issa's third criticism is perhaps the most important. The SEC has
   stopped moving toward open data in corporate disclosures. It has
   adopted the XBRL format for financial statements and notes, but it
   still requires the old-fashioned document version to be submitted too.
   Of all the securities regulators around the world adopting XBRL
   (a [54]partial list includes the UK, the European Union, China, India,
   Japan, South Africa, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates), not one
   has adopted the SEC's half measure. When a jurisdiction chooses to open
   up its corporate securities disclosures by applying the XBRL format, it
   switches all the way from documents to data. The only jurisdiction,
   anywhere, that requires filers to submit two versions of the same
   information is the SEC.
   Moreover, the SEC has given no indication whether it intends to
   transform other aspects of corporate disclosure--executive
   compensation, proxy statements, prospectuses, corporate structure,
   stock ownership--from documents into open data. That means companies
   don't know how their reporting requirements will change in the future.
   They don't know whether to invest in software that could automate their
   SEC reporting, because they don't know whether those reports will be
   structured data or still be documents and paper.
   Investors are demanding open data. The Investor Advisory Committee,
   when it asked the SEC to fully enforce the quality of existing XBRL
   filings, also called on the agency to "integrate data tagging into all
   future rulemaking and rule revision efforts that involve the collection
   of data by the SEC" ([55]page 3, emphasis added) and to prioritize
   certain forms for the transformation, including portions of the proxy
   statement, mutual fund voting disclosures, and corporate current
   reports on Form 8-K ([56]page 5). The SEC has yet to respond.
   Chairman Issa has asked the agency to produce "all documents relating
   to current use and planned future use" of structured data formats like
   XBRL ([57]page 5, emphasis added). But he probably would be happy with
   just one document: the SEC's plan for the future transformation from
   documents into open data--if such a plan exists exists.
   Issa's conclusion ([58]page 4) is worth repeating. It applies not only
   to the SEC but to all attempts to adopt open data in regulatory
   reporting:

     Structured data in financial regulatory reporting has the potential
     to create profound, positive changes: better enforcement through
     analytics, more efficient and more accurate reviews, improved market
     efficiency, cheaper capital costs, and the open data investors are
     demanding. These revolutionary improvements will only occur as the
     SEC integrates structured data into its existing review processes,
     enforces the quality of data submitted under the Interactive Data
     Rule, and articulates a vision for the transformation of its whole
     disclosure system from inaccessible documents into structured data.

       Darrell Issa, to put it kindly, is a hack. Having him on the side
       of any argument is defeatist, to say the least.
