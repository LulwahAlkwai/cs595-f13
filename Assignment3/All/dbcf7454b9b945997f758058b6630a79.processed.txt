Making electricity from burning wood is bad for the economy and the
environment

   My column in [16]the Times on 20 June 2013:


   In the Energy Bill going through Parliament there is allowance for
   generous subsidy for a huge push towards burning wood to produce
   electricity. It's already happening. Drax power station in Yorkshire
   has converted one of its boilers to burn wood pellets instead of coal;
   soon three of its six boilers will be doing this and the power station
   will then be receiving north of half a billion pounds a year in
   subsidy. By 2020, the Government estimates, up to 11 per cent of our
   generating capacity will be from burning wood.

   This is a really bad idea. It will cost a fortune, worsen air
   pollution, exacerbate dependency on foreign energy and increase
   greenhouse gas emissions compared with burning gas and maybe even with
   burning coal. All these are in direct contradiction of the Energy
   Bill's ostensible purpose. Yet "biomass" is trumpeted as a key part of
   the Government's strategy to keep the lights on and combat climate
   change.

   It is also a retrograde step, taking us back towards the days when we
   relied on plant growth for most of our energy. According to Tony
   Wrigley's recent book, [17]Energy and the English Industrial
   Revolution, firewood provided a third of Britain's energy under
   Elizabeth I, more than draught animals, human muscle-power, wind, water
   or coal. By the time of Queen Victoria, firewood's contribution had
   fallen to 0.1 per cent.

   This astonishing change was key to the industrial revolution. To
   sustain an industrial economy requires far more energy than can be
   obtained from even the fastest-growing trees, crops or from horses.
   Britain would have stagnated in the early 1800s if it had not tapped
   almost inexhaustible supplies of coal to replace the need to fell trees
   and grow oats for horses. By 1850 England was each year burning coal
   equivalent in energy terms to the maximum output of a forest one and a
   half times the country's land area. Thanks to coal, that deforestation
   could begin to be reversed. By 2000, Britain's forest cover had trebled
   since its low point in 1900.

   Under the Government's plan, biomass power stations will soon be
   burning much more wood than the country can possibly produce. There is
   a comforting myth out there that biomass imports are mainly waste that
   would otherwise decompose: peanut husks, olive pips, bark trimmings and
   the like. Actually, the bulk of the imports are already and will
   continue to be of wood pellets.

   It is instructive to trace these back to their origin. Reporters
   for The Wall Street Journal recently [18]found that the two pelleting
   plants established in the southern US specifically to supply Drax are
   not just taking waste or logs from thinned forest, but also taking logs
   from cleared forest, including swamp woodlands in North Carolina
   cleared by "shovel-logging" with giant bulldozers (running on diesel).
   Local environmentalists are up in arms.

   The logs are taken to the pelleting plants where they are dried,
   chopped and pelleted, in an industrial process that emits lots of
   carbon dioxide and pollutants. They are then trucked (more diesel) to
   ports, loaded on ships (diesel again), offloaded at the Humber on to
   (yet more diesel) trains, 40 of which arrive at Drax each day.

   Yet until recently the Government was in denial about all this diesel.
   "No net emissions during production are assumed," it said in its
   2007 Biomass Strategy. More recently, [19]it has admitted that the
   energy costs of transporting biomass can be up to "46 per cent of the
   energy generated by combustion at the power station" if shipped from
   afar.

   Storing the pellets is not easy. If too dry, they spontaneously burst
   into flames, as happened at Tilbury last year. The Health and Safety
   Executive warns that stored wood pellets also produce carbon monoxide,
   which can suffocate in a confined space.

   Burn the pellets and you produce smoke. The Committee on the Medical
   Effects of Air Pollutants says airborne particulates kill more people
   than road traffic accidents. It is no accident that the Renewable Heat
   Incentive, designed to subsidise us replacing gas boilers with wood
   burners for central heating, is not available in cities because it
   could break air-quality limits. To put it more bluntly, your Government
   has decided that there is not enough pollution in the countryside.

   Moreover, soot -- or "black carbon" as scientists now call it -- has
   recently been shown to have a much bigger impact on climate than
   previously thought. "Global atmospheric absorption attributable to
   black carbon is too low in many models and should be increased by a
   factor of almost 3," [20]reads the key paper published this month.
   Because burning gas does not produce soot, this is another black mark
   against wood.

   As for carbon dioxide, clear-felling a forest is like raiding the
   carbon bank. Wood is the most carbon-rich fuel of all -- more so than
   coal and much more so than oil or gas. The biomass industry and the
   Government respond that trees regrow, so reabsorbing from the
   atmosphere the CO2 emitted when they were burnt. The Government's
   2012 UK Bioenergy Strategy says that wood burning "results in lower
   total GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions than leaving the wood
   unharvested".

   But it only achieves this result by measuring the effect over 100
   years. That's how long it takes on average for the forest to regrow.
   And this assumes that you do not then cut it down again, or you are
   back to square one.

   Over 20 or 40 years, study after study shows that wood burning is far
   worse than gas, and worse even than coal, in terms of its greenhouse
   gas emissions. The effect on forest soil, especially if it is peaty,
   only exacerbates the disparity. The peat dries out and oxidises.

   Yet the Government persists in regarding biomass burning as zero-carbon
   and therefore deserving of subsidy. It does so by the Orwellian feat of
   defining sustainability as a 60 per cent reduction in emissions from
   fossil fuels. As Calor Gas puts it: "This is a logical somersault too
   far, conveniently -- for the sake of cherry-picking the technology --
   equating 40 per cent to 0 per cent." (Calor Gas supplies rural gas and
   is understandably miffed at being punitively treated while a higher-
   carbon rival industry is subsidised. See [21]here, [22]here and
   [23]here) Moreover, unlike gas or coal, you are pinching nature's lunch
   when you cut down trees. Unfelled, the trees would feed beetles,
   woodpeckers, fungi and all sorts of other wildlife when they died, let
   alone when they lived. Nothing eats coal.

   So, compared with gas, the biomass dash is bad for the climate, bad for
   energy security and dependence on imports, bad for human health, bad
   for wildlife and very bad for the economy. Apart from that, what's not
   to like?


   Postscript: For those who objected to my comment that wood produces
   more carbon dioxide than coal, please see the following short note from
   the Partnership for Policy Integrity
   (http://www.pfpi.net/carbon-emissions):


   "Burning biomass emits more CO2 than fossil fuels per megawatt energy
   generated:

   1. Wood inherently emits more carbon per Btu than other fuels
     * [24]Natural gas: 117.8 lb CO2/mmbtu
     * [25]Bituminous coal: 205.3 lb CO2/mmbtu
     * [26]Wood: 213 lb CO2/mmbtu (bone dry)

   2.  Wood is often wet and dirty, which degrades heating value Typical
   moisture content of wood is 45 - 50%, which means its btu content per
   pound is about half that of bone dry wood. Before "useful" energy can
   be derived from burning wood, some of the wood's btu's are required to
   evaporate all that water.

   3.  Biomass boilers operate less efficiently than fossil fuel boilers
   (data from air plant permit reviews and the Energy Information
   Administration)
     * Utility-scale biomass boiler: 24%
     * Average efficiency US coal fleet: 33%
     * Average gas plant: 43%"
