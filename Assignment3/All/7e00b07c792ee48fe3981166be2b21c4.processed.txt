   Why Self-Driving cars will need ejection seats.
   Interesting article in Huffington Post this week. Well timed because it
   points to a problem the FAA has also discovered with autopilots that is
   when the technology runs into a problem and says to itself "screw this
   bring in the human" the human isn't at all ready and the result is
   often a catastrophe. Imagine you are riding along in your self-driving
   car, reading a book, doing email, watching a movie and suddenly your
   car alarms and the computer hides under your dashboard giving all
   control back over to you. You have to instantly become aware of
   whatever freaked the computer out (and this is a technology that can do
   a 100 things before you can think the words "oh shit" and save the car.
   Personally I think this suggests we'll need ejection seats in
   self-driving cars. Full article in the Huffington Post:
