   What's This?

   By Lance Ulanoff2013-09-17 15:30:15 -0400

   How do you book your online travel? On a site like [48]Travelocity,
   [49]Expedia or [50]Orbitz? If you live in the United States, you most
   likely don't use Skyscanner, a global travel booking company with roots
   in Europe. Only now is the site expanding its footprint into the U.S.

   The 300-person company recently acquired Fogg, a Barcelona-based hotel
   search company, poising it to make a bigger splash in the online travel
   space.

   "Our users are going to love hotel search as a result of this
   acquisition," said Skyscanner CEO and co-founder Gareth Williams in a
   press release. "We built the best flight search product anywhere in the
   world. We then expanded that offering into car rental. And today we've
   taken a big step towards completing the picture in the space of hotel
   search."

   I sat down with Williams just as his company announced the Fogg deal.
   Skyscanner, which boasts direct connections to 300 airlines and 400
   online travel agencies, hopes to provide the same kind of direct
   connections in the hotel space. The goal here is growth -- especially,
   it seems, in the U.S.

How Big is the Pie?

   Travel is a hot space and a multi-billion-dollar industry. According to
   the research firm [52]eMarketer, digital travel sales will top $136
   billion by the end of this year and are projected to grow at least
   another 20% over the next five years.

   Spotting this opportunity, major internet players like [53]Google and
   [54]Microsoft have purchased search technology companies like
   [55]Farecast (Bing) and [56]ITA (Google) to shore up travel-related
   search results. Companies like [57]Priceline, Orbitz, [58]Cheapoair and
   Travelocity spend millions on television advertising and marketing.

   Skyscanner runs no TV ads and is not a household name, but has found
   some success. According to Williams, Skyscanner has 24 million unique
   monthly visitors and 25 million installed apps. It generates roughly
   one-third of its traffic through mobile (not counting mobile web
   searches) and expects to post $100 million in revenues this year. It
   also has 50% repeat business, which is good news as long as the service
   grows month over month with new customers.

   One reason Skyscanner execs believe they draw in so many repeat
   customers is price. Customers get the travel price set by the airlines,
   so they don't have to pay an extra percentage to Skyscanner. Williams
   says his company makes money through referrals and, sometimes, a
   percentage of the booking fee (though that cost is not added on and
   charged to the customer).

   When I noted that travel searches on Skyscanner did not result in
   significantly lower fares than my findings on comparable services like
   Kayak, Skyscanner representatives acknowledged that the greatest
   savings usually come from international travel. (Even there, though,
   the differences were not great.) A Skyscanner representative explained
   in an email, "It's also about more than price -- inspirational and
   functional travel both require a balance of price, convenience of time
   and preferred airline. The comprehensive coverage we offer is really
   important in that it gives customers greater choice in all of these
   areas."

   For Williams, there is no magic to finding the best travel fares. The
   tips people offer -- only book on Tuesdays, wait until midnight -- are
   mostly myths, according to Williams.

   "People think it's like book search," he said, referring to an index
   search using keywords and numbers. The reality is that travel search is
   hard, real-time, distributed, live-data-centric work. One query can
   yield 1,000 results. Travel startups have a tough time and a much
   higher failure rate than other startups because the data is so hard to
   reach, parse and deliver, Williams said. "Our job is to make it appear
   simple."

Plenty of Challenges

   Simplifying travel search is only part of Skyscanner's challenge as it
   tries to break into the lucrative U.S. travel market. Unlike some other
   mega travel sites, Skyscanner doesn't let you book directly.

   According to Rafat Ali, CEO and founder of travel intelligence startup
   [59]Skift, that makes Skyscanner more akin to the better-known travel
   metasearch engine Kayak. Metasearch engines are defined as sites that
   do not handle transactions; those that do, like Priceline, are known as
   online travel agencies or OTAs.

   Now, though, some crucial differences exist.

   "Now that Kayak is owned by Priceline and many times bigger than
   Skyscanner, [Skyscanner] will have a tough time competing against the
   giants," Ali wrote in an email. "Chances of global domination are tiny,
   but there are profitable niches in online travel booking, mostly
   regional ... Skyscanner would be smart to focus on its traditional
   stronghold of Europe."

   Marcello Gasdia, consumer behavior analyst with the market research
   firm [60]PhoCusWright, was also skeptical.

   "There's a reason why Skyscanner performs well in Europe and why
   they'll have a really tough time in U.S.," Gasdia told me.

   Metasearch services like Skyscanner are thriving right now in Europe's
   challenging economic conditions, Gasdia explained. Additionally, an
   incredibly fragmented online travel market like Europe's demands a
   simple solution like Skyscanner. In the U.S., where the economy is
   bouncing back and the market is dominated by big travel companies and
   hotel chains, OTAs and metasearch engines like Kayak -- which partner
   with or are owned by huge OTA parents -- rule. Even the airline
   industry is seeing more consolidation (for example, take American
   Airlines and U.S. Airways).

   Gasdia acknowledges that, at least for consumers, the line between OTAs
   and metasearch services is blurring. But he still thinks Skyscanner
   will have its work cut out in the U.S., where "Priceline and Expedia
   own a very large part of the online travel space."

   To win in the U.S., Skyscanner must deliver travel results as good (or
   better) than the competition and overcome the significant market
   hurdles outlined by Gasdia and Ali -- or someone could simply buy them.

   When I asked about the possibility of an acquisution-hungry company
   like [61]Yahoo snapping it up, Williams laughed.

   "[Skyscanner has] at least a times-10 to achieve before that would
   happen," he said, meaning he wants to scale the business by a factor of
   10. Surprisingly, Williams says that at its current rate of growth,
   Skyscanner could achieve that goal in three years. The person
   responsible for helping Skyscanner make this goal a reality is Chief
   Marketing Officer Andrew Cocker, who worked at [62]Yahoo
   pre-[63]Marissa Mayer.

   During our meeting, Cocker noted that Skyscanner is particularly good
   at finding travel destinations during a certain period that fit within
   your budget.

   Skyscanner is not on the market and Williams would rather run
   independently and serve as the "most trusted online travel company in
   the world." The Fogg acquisition is one step, but it sounds like the
   stairway to global (and more importantly) U.S.-based online travel
   success is quite high and steep.
