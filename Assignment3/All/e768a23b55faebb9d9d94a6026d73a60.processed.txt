Facebook Launches Redesigned Mobile App for iOS 7

   [48]Facebook announced a new version of its iOS app on Wednesday to
   correspond with the launch of [49]iOS 7. The new version of the
   Facebook app, which will be available in the App Store later on
   Wednesday, has been completely redesigned to fit within the new
   operating system, says Michael Sharon, Facebook's product manager for
   iOS.

   The most noticeable design change is that the app's main navigation bar
   has been moved to the bottom of the screen, replacing the old
   navigation bar at the top of screen. The new design also eliminates the
   tool bar that slid out from the left-hand side of the app in the old
   version.

   The new navigation bar across the bottom of the screen features tabs
   for [51]News Feed, Friend Requests, Notifications, Messages, and a
   "More" tab that serves a similar purpose to the old left-hand tool bar.
   Sharon refers to the "More" tab as a "bonus tab," allowing users to
   open up other areas of Facebook like Events or Photos without losing
   their place in other tabs. For example, a user could begin to comment
   on an item from his or her News Feed, then check her Events without
   losing her half-finished comment. In the old version, leaving the
   comment to check another area of the app would have resulted in the
   comment disappearing.

   Users can also swipe across the new navigation bar to move from one tab
   to another, says Sharon.

                             Facebook-iOS7-web-2

   The new iOS 7 Facebook app also has new aesthetic features to go along
   with the operating system's new functionality, says Sharon. The app's
   search and navigation bar across the top is translucent, and icons like
   the "paperclip" (used to denote an attachment) and the lettering in
   messages have been visually updated to "make the app feel at home"
   within iOS 7, says Sharon.

   Facebook has been testing different versions of the navigation bar
   since March, and at any given time over the past six months there have
   been 1 to 2 million users unknowingly utilizing versions of the
   redesigned navigation bar, says Sharon. Through feedback from users,
   Facebook made changes to the tab in preparation for Wednesday's launch,
   including removing Timeline as a widget. At one point, Facebook took
   the an early version of the navigation bar away from its test users
   only to receive negative app reviews and feedback from people asking
   for it back, says Sharon.

                             Facebook-iOS-web-3

   The new iOS app is also available to users with iOS 5 or iOS 6, says
   Sharon, although there are small stylistic differences between the
   versions, including the color of the navigation bar. Facebook's new iOS
   app is available for mobile phones only -- iPad users will still see
   the old design. Facebook has no plans to bring the new design to iPad,
   says Sharon, who added that the old design is a better fit for how
   users navigate Facebook on tablets.

   Facebook will continue to test the iOS app and plans to update it
   regularly moving forward based on user feedback, says Sharon. The new
   design will not affect Facebook's Android app, which it will continue
   to test independently, he adds.

   comments below.

Hands On With iOS 7

    1. Ios7-1

Starting Up
       From the moment iOS 7 loads, its clear this is different. The linen
       that infused iOS 5 and iOS 6 is gone, replaced with white and thin
       sans serif typography.
    2. Ios7-2

A Splash of Color
       While white is a predominant theme in iOS 7, this is not a
       monochrome OS. Color accents are almost always visible.
    3. Ios7-3

The New Home Screen
       For the first time since the original iPhone, the overall look and
       icon structure of iOS is now new and fresh.
       The wallpaper can now be dynamic or static. Dynamic wallpaper is
       similar to the animated wallpaper in Android, except it doesn't
       interact with your finger. The default wallpaper is static.
    4. Ios7-4

A Cleaner Inbox
       Mail has received a full revamp to both its main view and the
       compose screen.
    5. Ios7-5

New Integrated Services
       Flickr and Vimeo join Facebook and Twitter as built-in services.
    6. Ios7-6

Folders and Control Center
       Swiping up from the bottom brings up the Control Center. This is an
       easy way to access your most used settings, including WiFi, audio,
       brightness and quick access to alarm, a calculator, camera and
       flashlight.
       Meanwhile, photos can now store more items and span pages.
    7. Ios7-7

Camera Options
       The new camera interface has a number of options built-in. Swiping
       across the bottom brings up options for the standard camera or the
       video camera.
    8. Ios7-8

Instagram Friendly
       There is a new square mode on the camera, perfect for Instagram.
       The panorama mode is still here too.
    9. Ios7-9

Houston We Have Filters
       Apple also has its own filters built-into iOS 7. Rather than simply
       applying a filter in post, these filters are actually real-time and
       you can look through the viewfinder in that filter before taking a
       shot.
   10. Ios7-10

Stocks and Notes
       The Stocks app looks totally fresh. Notes also has a new coat of
       paint. The texture is still there but the yellow lined paper and
       Marker Felt are a thing of the past.
   11. Ios7-11

iTunes and Wish Lists
       iTunes and the App Store both have new designs. Additionally, Apple
       has introduced a new Wish List feature on mobile, making it easy
       for users to save an app to buy later.
   12. Ios7-12

App Store
       The App Store structure is still the same but the look is more
       fresh. In addition to the general charts, users can also check to
       see what apps are popular in their area.
   13. Ios7-13

Sharing Or Adding to a Wishlist
       A new share button shows off what you can do with an app which
       includes AirDrop and adding it to a wishlist.
   14. Ios7-14

Passbook and News Stand
       Both look fresh.
   15. Ios7-15

Lock Screen
       The Lock screen no longer has anything to slide to unlock, just
       swipe to the right.
       You can choose to make Control Center available at the lock screen
       or not.
   16. Ios7-32

Notifications and Weather
       Pulling down from the top still brings up notifications, only now
       without linen and with a history.
       The weather app is beautiful and animated.
   17. Ios7-16

Reminders
       Reminders is now more robust in its appearance. There are different
       groups of reminders, not just lists.
       The new reminder screen also has a refined look. It still has
       texture, but the lines are less bold.
   18. Ios7-17

Compass
       The compass looks totally new and totally great.
   19. Ios7-18

Switching Apps
       Double tapping home brings up full screen previews of various apps.
       Scroll back and forth and see previews of your apps in real-time.
       Some might say this is copying Window Phone, but really, this look
       was pioneered by Palm with the late, great, webOS.
   20. Ios7-19

Dialer and Messages
       The dialer and the iMessage interface follow the new trends of
       being bright and with lots fo color.
   21. Ios7-20

Notifications
       Notifications pop-up in dark now, not white.
   22. Ios7-30

Calendar
       The calendar is de-leathered and has a very Google+ look.
   23. Ios7-31

Calendar Inbox
       The calendar gets a proper inbox for incoming invitations.
   24. Ios7-21

Maps
       Apple Maps has toned down some of its textures but the basic app
       looks very similar.
   25. Ios7-22

Directions
       The directions page in Maps has been rebuilt and it looks much more
       sleek.
   26. Ios7-23

Calculator and Clock
       The calculator still pays homage to the great HP calculators of the
       70s, but with fewer bevels.
       As for the clock, gone is that patent-infringing world clock look.
   27. Ios7-24

Alarms and Stopwatch
       Check out the 3D effect when picking a time.
   28. Ios7-25

Timer and Settings
       The timer is totally new too. This is what one of the standard
       settings pages looks like.
   29. Ios7-26

Safari
       The bookmarks section for Safari is texture free but full of color.
       The search and URL omnibox makes a glorious return (it was
       separated with iOS 3 back in 2009).
       The whole look of this browser would look equally at home at
       Mountain View as it does in Cupertino.
   30. Ios7-27

Searching and Loading a Page
       Typing in a URL or string of text offers up real-time suggestions
       for an address or search query.
       The thin bar at the top of the screen indicates page load progress.
   31. Ios7-28

Tabs
       It's like Cover Flow, but vertical!
   32. Ios7-29

FaceTime Audio
       FaceTime can now do audio calls!
