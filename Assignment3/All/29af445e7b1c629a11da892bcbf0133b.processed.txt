How Do You Think We Should Manage Science in Fiscally Challenging Times?

   Posted on [15]October 17, 2011 by [16]Sally Rockey

   This is a tough budget time for all federal organizations. NIH is among
   them, having experienced a relatively flat budget for the past seven
   years and facing a continuation of this pattern or perhaps even
   declining budgets for 2012 and beyond. As we consider how to continue
   to fund outstanding biomedical research during austere times, we are
   weighing various options, including looking closely at the way we
   manage NIH resources. As part of the deliberation process, we have put
   together information on some funding scenarios, such as limiting the
   number of research program grant awards per investigator, the total
   amount of awards per investigator, the size of awards, or the amount of
   salary support paid by NIH.

   The biomedical research enterprise is a partnership between NIH and the
   extramural community, and we don't expect to make any changes to our
   processes without an in-depth discussion with you. We are interested in
   your ideas about how best to manage in complex budgetary times. We have
   posted the information we gathered about the various options on the
   [17]OER website. I encourage you to take a look at the data. There are
   even some interactive graphs where you can visualize the effect of the
   various options. Then let us know what you think. As always, you are
   welcome to comment here on the blog, and we've also set up an email box
   specifically to receive feedback on these issues,
   [18]NIHResourceManagement@nih.gov.

   Your feedback is going to be vital as we move forward on what could be
   a bumpy terrain.  Hopefully, we can have smooth sailing with your
   creative ideas providing the wind!

       I don't know the answer to this aside from the obvious - one
       possibility is to cut the size of the awards, but not the number of
       people receiving them. Another is to renegotiate indirect costs
       with institutions. I don't understand how so much money goes into
       indirect costs, and how there can be so much variation in these
       costs between institutions even within the same city. Is there a
       way for the NIH to pressure institutions to cut back on
       administrative costs that is not at the expense of research?
       Provided that indirect cost negotiation is not possible, another
       thought is to award funding to academic DEPARTMENTS instead of
       individuals. This would substantially reduce time spent writing
       grants, reduce the number of grants, and decisions would be left to
       department chairs to allocate funding among members of their
       department.

            Many faculty get upset about indirect costs and believe it
            goes to support administration. The fact is the administrative
            portion of indirect costs is already capped at 26%. The
            majority of your indirect costs support space, heat , light
            and power. The Institution I work at supports research with
            millions of its own monies in addition to Federal monies. If
            indirects were to be taken away- that support would be reduced
            because the bills still need to be paid. Cutting indirects
            from grants in the long run would hurt Science and is not a
            realistic way to manage the budget in challenging times.
            Without the support for the infrastructure there will be very
            few institutions that will perform research in the future.
            Limiting the number of awards per PI seems unfair. So we limit
            a good scientist and award dollars to what could be less
            promising science just to manage the budget and say we gave
            out more awards?

                 I understand the value of F&A to research and that it is
                 necessary. However, for some institutions, it seems
                 absurdly high (as much as 70%) and much more so than
                 other institutions within the same metropolitan area
                 (where cost of living, building expense, etc are presumed
                 to be the same). What accounts for this disparity, and
                 should the NIH be responsible for paying for it?

                      It depends on what is negotiated as a separate
                      research rate and the composition of its base and
                      pool costs. Normally, what I see are new buildings
                      and the associated debt costs over a relatively
                      lower research base = higher rate. For example, you
                      build a research facility that gets its own rate,
                      but the volume of research done there is quite less
                      than the main campus rate. So you could have a main
                      campus rate of 50%, but a new research rate of 70%
                      for the other facility. Over time, the two will get
                      closer as the volume goes up at the other campus.
                      However, it is important for the institution to
                      recoup some of its investment in the new facility
                      especially if part of the higher F&A income will be
                      used for debt service.

                           Well, if this is how disparate F&A is
                           calculated, it is no surprise that biomedical
                           research funding is in a non-sustainable
                           situation. Basically, this system is rewarding
                           universities for making fiscally irresponsible
                           decisions to build major research buildings
                           that they can not afford. This is also
                           penalizing universities that are fiscally
                           responsible since they do not have debt service
                           on their research infrastructure.
                           I have always wondered how so many universities
                           whose faculty are completely soft money are
                           putting up so many new research buildings while
                           we work in a sardine can at my university in
                           regard to research space. Now I know. If
                           biomedical research in the USA is going to
                           survive the coming fiscal crisis, NIH has to
                           stop rewarding unsustainable behavior by
                           universities and research institutions.

                           Even before the "irrational exuberance" of the
                           NIH doubling period, some institutions (e.g.,
                           some in Boston come to mind) gamed this process
                           to have buildings or institutes with F&A rates
                           in the 80 - 120% range. Imagine a non-modular
                           application from a place with a 120% F&A rate:
                           award of that grant could often fund TWO
                           10-module R01's rated at a level that is not
                           statistically significant in its difference
                           and, I daresay most study section members would
                           say, not meaningfully different (i.e., how
                           strong is the predictive power of the panel
                           really to select for "the highest likelihood of

                      If you think F&A are run away costs, then one
                      strategy is to use Total Costs more in funding
                      decisions. When a $1.5M application with a great
                      review gets skipped, at some point the applicant
                      institution will get the picture.

                 no indirects on govt funded grants and about 8 percent on
                 industry supported grants. I think this will free up a
                 lot of money.
                 I know my grants go through 4 people (administrative)
                 before it gets submitted to NIH. Does it require that
                 many people? I could do with 1 person doing it.

            Since the federal government awards the institutions that the
            applicants are associated with, the concept proposed
            (individuals vs. departments) is not valid. Regarding recovery
            of Facilities and Administrative (indirect cost) costs,
            institutions renegotiate continually with the understanding
            that the agreements will remain in place for several years.
            The negotiating process takes into account the size of the
            operation rather than the location. Small campuses should not
            require as high a rate as a large campus that has many
            buildings to maintain and administrative costs appropriate to
            the size of the organization. In one city there may be
            hundreds of universities, hospitals, colleges, etc., all
            different from each other in its size and offerings. Some will
            have medical schools, others will have only limited schools
            and research opportunities. Some will be private, others
            support by state/county/city funds.
            There is no easy answer to controlling and distributing
            funding, but reducing recovery of indirect costs is not the
            best way because it undercuts the ability of the applicant
            organization to support its research activity.

       Thank you very much for posting these slides. These provide real
       data for a debate that has been raging in the community for a
       number of years (often without data). Clearly, from the data, the
       thing to do is to limit the total money available to an individual
       PI. Limiting this number to $1M would provide 2000 additional
       grants? Those are serious numbers.
       Earlier, data was posted that the average impact factor and average
       number of papers peaked at about a funding level of about $750k.
       (Nature 468, 356-357 (2010))
       As has been stated by many people over the years, there is a "death
       wall" at zero grants. If you have four grants and lose one, then
       there will likely be job losses and pain, but the lab won't shut
       down. On the other hand, if you have one grant and lose one, you
       will likely lose your lab (particularly if this happens before
       tenure, but often even after tenure). Extinction is forever.
       Therefore, I don't want to see the number of grants limited.
       However, limiting the largest labs in favor of more grants to
       smaller labs would seem a clear advantage to the system.
       However, what we *really* need is a more stable system, in which a
       small lab can plan for a long term scientific career. It's the
       instability that causes stress and the wasted time applying for all
       those grants. The instability creates a feedback loop where one has
       to apply for many grants to keep a stable lab. This lowers the
       funding rate, creates more work for CSR (and the reviewers on study
       sections), and wastes scientists' time writing grants that will
       never be funded.

       I think it is a very good idea to make these data and the
       interactive slides available to the scientific community. However,
       some key points deserve clarification. On slide 2, it is stated
       that the current way of managing is to "bottom out success rates
       (doing nothing but letting the system correct itself)". I do not
       think that this correctly represents the situation. As Director of
       NIGMS for 7 1/2 years, we used a number of the degrees of freedom
       shown in the slides to manage success rates. For example, awards
       sizes were often reduced below the requested amount to increase the
       number of new and competing awards that could be made. We realized
       that these reductions had implications for the funded
       investigators, but in periods of constrained appropriations, these
       were deemed to be less problematic than further decreases in the
       number of awards that could be made. In addition, NIGMS has had a
       long-standing policy of scrutinizing potential awards to
       well-funded laboratories (see
       [92]http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/Application/NAGMSCouncilGuide
       lines.htm), defined as laboratories have annual direct costs from
       all sources of over $750,000. Note that this is not a cap, but
       rather a process involving program staff and the advisory council
       to ensure that such potential awards are carefully considered with
       respect to alternative awards to less well-funded laboratories.
       Thus, some of the approaches described have already been utilized.
       Furthermore, we have attempted to analyze scientific output in the
       context of these policies (see
       [93]https://loop.nigms.nih.gov/index.php/2010/09/27/measuring-the-s
       cientific-output-and-impact-of-nigms-grants/). Some trends are
       indicated but there are, of course, many challenges to measuring
       scientific output in a meaningful way. Furthermore, as one might
       aniticipate, there are large variations at any given level of
       support. NIH and the scientific community need to work together to
       use the available data to develop policies that can best sustain
       the biomedical research enterprise in the long run.

            with general praise) to Jeremy Berg's apt comment. The first
            thing to say is that I think comments I believe were in, of
            all places, report language from a Congressional
            Appropriations committee were spot-on: (from memory, and
            paraphrasing): `further continuation of whittling away at
            awards or allowing pay lines and success rates to keep on
            falling is not a viable strategy'. In broad terms, the point
            has a lot of validity that NIGMS - within the "universe" of
            grant types that go to its portfolio - has been able to do
            some good things by whittling and whittling has some truth to
            it, but at the same time the NIGMS strategy being noted has
            the downside that it condemns many awards from the outset by
            providing less funding than is needed to meet the stated Aims
            or objective, cuts length of award, etc. While providing some
            mitigation - especially for less expensive forms of research -
            the quoted strategy falls squarely within what Congress -
            correctly I think - points out as an inadequate approach for a
            future in which Congress may not increase nominal dollar
            appropriations for NIH (let alone appropriating what would be
            needed, i.e., at least increases that match BRDPI / biomedical
            research inflation rates). If memory serves, Congress is
            essentially warning NIH that rethinking certain fundamental
            assumptions is going to be needed. Looking at the comment
            below brings one matter to mind where NIH and the research
            community need to get real about the TP influence: why pay way
            more for equivalent priority (i.e., no meaningful difference
            in percentile) science simply because the institutions are in
            high-cost regions and some institutions went on a gold-plated
            building splurge to put booster rockets on the depreciation
            component of their F&A costs?

       A younger colleague and I just attended both the most recent NIH
       regional grants conference and the NSF regional grants conference
       this week, and he had an interesting observation about the
       difference. He noted that there was much less sense of desperation
       at the NSF meeting. Why did more of the attendees seem desperate at
       the NIH meeting? I think the answer is germane to this discussion.
       The research models are very different. Most NSF faculty applicants
       are on 9 month appointments, and NSF only allows 2 months of summer
       salary for such PIs, over all of their NSF funding (iirc). There
       are not very many soft money positions in the NSF-type arena, and
       certainly nowhere near the number in biomedicine. The expectations
       in other science, technology, and engineering parts of the
       university are completely different from the medical school
       culture, where research may be the primary, if not only activity
       expected of a faculty member.
       In some ways, it's an argument for limiting the total salary a PI
       can put across his/her portfolio of NIH grants. But if the
       university is expected to cover the rest, then either researchers
       fall out of the system when the soft-money positions disappear, or
       university administrators will rightly want return for the
       salaries, with faculty expected to take up teaching duties, etc.
       Faculty salaries vary quite a bit, too, and medical school salaries
       are generally much higher than Arts & Sciences or Engineering. The
       argument made for the disparity often points to the increased
       "value" of the medical school faculty to the university, based on
       their aggregate ability to bring in NIH grants. Except they're
       expected to cover their own salaries on grants. It's at Catch 22
       all around.Most of the changes up for discussion do not challenge
       this model. The question then becomes, is the medical school
       research model necessary for advancement in biomedical science?

       Sounds like I might be voicing an unpopular view here, but I would
       support letting the system correct itself by continuing the current
       approach to funding applications (i.e., success rates fall). If
       anything, the size and duration of awards should be increased so
       that PIs can spend more time guiding and doing research and less
       time on applications and reporting. Yes, this means some
       laboratories will lose grant funding altogether - it is painful but
       the alternatives are not only painful, they also reduce the quality
       of U.S. biomedical research.
       Many of the proposed options explicitly reduce the extent to which
       NIH funding is merit-based. The assumption seems to be that society
       owes every existing faculty member / PI funding to continue
       research, even if that research does not compete well with its
       peers. I think this is a mistake. Don't get me wrong, I'm not
       saying that the existing review process yields perfectly
       merit-based awards but at least that is the goal, rather than the
       goal being to preserve all existing laboratories. This would only
       make sense if we want to preserve labs through a short period of
       austerity; for the long-term it jeopardizes the health of the whole
       enterprise. If the NIH funding were divided evenly among all PhD
       scientists, the resulting amounts would be too small for anyone to
       accomplish anything useful.
       Some notes on the specific options proposed by NIH via the OER
       website link in the blog post...
       - Reducing or limiting size (or length) of awards:
       Please, please, no. This increases the number of grants a lab must
       write to support the same, good science, and many believe that the
       current sizes/time periods of grants are already too small to
       support the amount of application/reporting involved. Cutting large
       projects simply because they are expensive is arbitrary. If a
       particular large project is believed to be unproductive and not
       worth the money, then it should be reviewed accordingly and its
       score should reflect this. Making a blanket decision that large
       projects should all be eliminated in favor of many small projects
       will specifically target some of our most technologically advanced
       and multi-disciplinary projects and negatively impact U.S. science.
       - Limiting number of awards held by an PI or the amount of funds an
       PI can hold:
       The idea here is to re-direct money from successful scientists to
       less successful scientists. How does this help research quality?
       - Limiting % effort of PIs supported by NIH funding
       As far as I can tell, this makes the assumption PIs in soft-money
       positions are less productive than those who split their time with
       teaching responsibilities. I know of no evidence to support this
       and do not understand how pure-research institutions would survive
       (would their excess effort need to come from institution F&A?). The
       review process includes assessing the quality of research produced
       by the PI. Making a blanket decision to dictate how much of a PI's
       effort should be devoted to research vs. teaching or other
       responsibilities seems irrelevant.
       An option not proposed in the NIH's materials would be to shift
       from a project-based merit system to a PI-based merit system. This
       would provide some long-term stability for labs (which seems to be
       the motivation for many commenters) without reducing the quality of
       research funded.

            The point of most of the proposals is NOT to move funding from
            productive investigators to the non-productive. As anyone who
            does a lot of grant review knows, there is no meaningful
            difference in quality between the grant scored 20% and 10%,
            these differences in scores often ride on small differences
            that are probably not related to whether the science should be
            done. Further, the most recent reductions in paylines have
            even grants scoring at the 10% not getting paid. In this case
            the system is completely broken, peer review can not
            distinguish between an 8% grant and a 14% grant. In my
            experience, the top 1/4 of grants that I see should be paid
            and the projects allowed to go forward. The writing on the
            wall says that money will continue to get tighter, and "bang
            for buck" needs to be considered. As a reviewer, I see grants
            all of the time with 400K budgets that are essentially paying
            a PI 180K, a postdoc 50K and a senior tech 75K that produce
            1-2 papers per year. Yes, that is reasonable for the amount of
            staff, but it is WAY over priced in relationship to grants
            with 250K per year budgets that have a PI paid 25% of salary,
            a tech and some grad students that publish 2-3 papers per
            year. Further, the grad students end up paying back the US
            economy greatly since they then go to high paying jobs in
            industry, increase the tax base, and provide skilled workers
            for the biotech industry. Thus, the grant's impact is greatly
            multiplied, great science is done and skilled workers are
            produced.
            The current system does not allow decisions to be made on any
            sort of cost benefit basis and is thus broken. Since the
            status quo is not sustainable, please realize that major
            changes are necessary and they need to not break the pipeline
            of skilled workers to our scientific industrial base.

                 Several very important suggestions have appeared,
                 including setting uniform indirect cost rates at least
                 geographically and limiting the total grant dollars an
                 investigator can acquire (taking into account not the
                 total face value of a grant but the actual amount
                 attributed to a specific PI). Another factor to consider
                 is that many state institutions ask their faculty to
                 request salary reimbursement from Federal grants even
                 though the state budget includes their salaries at 100%.
                 Such state institutions then feed the excess money back
                 to the investigators, in effect as unreviewed grant
                 supplements. This practice should be stopped. I also
                 agree that the NIH is currently enforcing non-existent
                 distinctions among grants in the top 25%. Anyone who has
                 ever served on study section knows that the top scores go
                 to people who have friends or at least champions as
                 reviewers. Having reviewers who are strongly supportive
                 of the science isn't good enough. The score is the score,
                 however, and NIH has no other information to go on. So I
                 would advocate a sliding scale system of paying. The
                 grants in the top 5% would be paid at 100% (see comment
                 on budgets below) and others paid at lower levels until
                 the 25th percentile. That would allow highly meritorious
                 projects to receive at least enough money to keep their
                 projects alive. The current system of budgeting of NIH
                 grants is deeply flawed. Investigators ask for whatever
                 they think they can get away with and study sections are
                 reluctant to make significant changes, especially in
                 modular grants. A better system would empower study
                 sections to decide on a budget without input from the
                 applicant. The basis for assigning a budget would be the
                 nature of the work (e.g., how many animals or expensive
                 reagents are needed), its potential impact and the
                 urgency of answering the question posed. All budgets
                 would be modular in such a system. I would add that NIH
                 spends far too much money on ideas generated by their
                 program officers rather than by investigators and far too
                 much on buildings that turn out to be white elephants
                 (NIAID is particularly guilty in this respect). Also, the
                 amount of money spent on intramural research has been
                 never been seriously evaluated. Scientists from academic
                 institutions who are asked to review intramural research
                 programs are consistently appalled at the >$1 million
                 budgets many NIH investigators enjoy. I disagree with the
                 suggestion that universities should be obliged to pay a
                 certain fraction of faculty salaries. Doing so would
                 eliminate research track positions.

            wildly optimistic (in my opinion) about the fairness of the

            university affiliation, etc. can count for more than the
            actual science being proposed. In other words there is not
            necessarily a level playing field here. What you are proposing
            is basically a "free market" approach but the game is somewhat

            validity of assuming you can tell the difference in any
            meaningful way between a 12%, 16%, or 18% grant application.
            The overall point is that there is a lot of good science that
            is not being funded due to simple lack of funds.

            The solutions by Anne C. seem to represent the current
            problems and not new useful approaches that are required for
            these very different and difficult times. The self-correcting
            mentality is the ease solution and primary philosophy of many
            of our new representatives in congress. Instead, lets do the
            hard work (which, fortunately, is ingrained in most
            scientists) and solve some of the key problems instead of this
            idea that the strongest (our luckiest) will survive, which
            doesn't mean the best scientists. Anne states that "The
            assumption seems to be that society owes every existing
            faculty member / PI funding to continue research". I haven't
            read anyone making this assumption. This and other
            generalizations (exaggerations) are what diminish
            constructive/productive discussions, as people then need to
            correct such falsehoods vs. providing reasonable solutions.
            Funding certainly should be extended to those in the, for
            example, 9-13 percentile ranking (i.e., for those funded by
            NIAID), as the impact of this work is mostly indistinguishable
            from that in the 6-9 percentile. The sliding scale funding
            model (similar to the NHLBI model) is one of the obvious
            approaches that should be used by all Institutes. Bridge
            funding (R56) can be a life saver but is too short, lets put
            those funds into extending a sliding scale.

            The key problem is the assumption that if you do any kind of
            `adjustments' to the system (like capping the number of grants
            by a PI), the system is no longer merit based. You are
            shifting funds from good science to bad science. Nothing can
            be farther from truth. The reason is that there are extremely
            good proposals being not funded right now. The top layer of
            unfunded proposals are indistinguishable from the funded ones.
            By funding those grants, you are not funding bad since, nor
            funding "unsuccessful" people. You are funding more great
            science.
            I agree with the last point that the way forward is to shift
            from a project-based to PI-based merit model. As long as you
            continue to do good science and are productive, chances of
            renewal should be very high. It cannot be a free ride once you
            get into the club. But some level of stability and assurance
            is essential if you want people to be career scientist. The
            current system is brutal and devastating to many senior,
            mid-level, and junior scientists alike.

       Considering the appalling number of labs that are on the verge of
       extinction and the incredibly shrinking level of NIH funding, the
       only feasible solutions are: A) limit the number of R01 grants per
       investigator to a maximum of two, and B) mandatorily limit the
       total RPG support (including non-R01 grants, NIH postdoctoral
       fellowships, etc.) to $800,000. The immediate implementation of
       these measures would free up enough funds to keep numerous
       creative, productive and deserving labs alive. Big labs would
       continue to do very well, even with "only" 15 people instead of 20!
       Let's not forget that such labs also receive substantial funding
       from private foundations and from post-doctoral fellowships. Too
       many labs have been/are being shut down and too many valid,
       creative scientists are being forced to leave academia in their
       mid-forties for an uncertain future. Let's not replicate the

       I think that NIH has to re-examine the assumption behind the
       establishment of current system. I remember that, only when the
       payline is higher than certain number (30%?), the current system is
       able to identify the meritorious grant and fund it. I am talking
       about payline, but not the so-called "successful rate", which is
       artificially inflated. Now, the payline is much much lower than the
       one that was based to establish the current system. Since we are
       all professional scientists, would it be shameful that we are even
       debating whether or not the current system needs to be changed,
       considering that the very foundation of the current system had been
       long gone? Once we understand this problem, the solution is
       actually very simple: Making every effort to restore the targeted
       payline!

       One suggestion is to use tiered system. For major grants, take R01
       for example. For an individual investigator, the payline of 1st R01
       or equivalent may set as 30%; 2nd as 20%; 3rd as 10%. etc. The
       logic behind is self-evident. A lab with 2 R01 has much more
       advantage to compete for 3nd grant than the lab with 0 or 1 R01.
       Another suggestion is to use reduced Ro1 to fund the grants outside
       the payline but having sufficient merit. For example, a 2-year R01,
       or 4 year R01 with $150,000 each year should be used to support
       these grants. There are many good reasons. For example, reviewers
       sometime criticize the validity of the 3rd aim, but have high
       enthusiasm for the first and second aim. If all three aims are
       independent, why can't the NIH just fund the first two? In another
       scenario, the proposal may be too risky; but if proven true, it may
       have very high impact. Thus, giving an award for a short period of
       time is justified to further develop such ideas. The current
       bridging mechanism needs to be expanded and incorporated into the
       grant review system.

            I think that the tiered system would be a good compromise
            between a hard limit on grant#/investigator (perhaps
            compromising quality) and trying to spreading out NIH funds,
            not just to support everyone, but to make sure that there is a
            large and diverse portfolio of research. An addition to the
            idea of the tiered system that has been proposed elsewhere is
            to decrease indirect costs awarded for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th
            grant, etc.

       I agree with several posts on this blog and thank Dr. Rockey for
       providing the research community with such a forum.
       In addition to the numerous suggestions to cap lab funding as the
       benefits above 750K are minimal; an approach that would make grant
       renewal in subsequent years less arduous should benefit the entire
       system and provide stability. For example providing some type of
       quinquennial review similar to the intramural system that will not
       be focused on preparing extremely long grant applications, but
       basing it more on past success and a strong yet succinct 5-year
       plan could be a better and more stable approach (taking an approach
       to invest in the people similar to HHMI and Welcome Trust).
       The benefits from such an approach are numerous, but in particular
       this will allow the PIs to be in the lab performing experiments,
       training PhD students and post-docs in a hands-on manner. The PIs
       can assist in the development of projects that should result in
       greater output, instead of spending months on end in an office
       preparing grants. In addition, putting in place a system that
       essentially allows young investigators to have 1 tech, 2 postdocs,
       and 2 grad students and tenured individuals to have 1 more of each
       generates lab units that are stable and costs associated with the
       labs less variable. I feel this approach used by the NIH
       (intramural), EMBL, CR-UK and now the Francis Crick Institute in
       London are highly efficient and result in greater scientific output
       as well as exceptional mentoring by the PIs who are at the bench
       and able to help train the next generation of scientists.
       One last downside to the mega-labs (besides postdoc and grad
       students never really receive any mentoring from the PI as they are
       locked up in an office writing grants and papers) is that it
       reduces diversity in the scientific community. Big name PIs with
       large labs have a lot of influence to get papers published in
       certain journals and then postdocs from these labs often go on to
       get the better faculty position, but in many instances are just
       clones of the mentor and their approaches to address scientific
       problems and develop hypotheses is very similar to the PI. However
       if there are many smaller lab units with different styles and
       approaches to developing novel hypotheses this should in theory
       increase the innovation, creativity, and in general scientific
       approach to tackle a problem.

                      lack of understanding of what the CTSA program is
                      all about. These are infrastructure grants to enable
                      clinical and translational research, so the "output"
                      is actually that of the sum total of everyone who
                      was supported by that infrastructure, and that is
                      certainly not "minimal." For example, the "Clinical
                      Service Cores" that many CTSA's have are hospital
                      beds or outpatient sites for testing clinical
                      research subjects. The number of high-profile
                      clinical studies that have depended on these units
                      and that have changed the way medicine is practiced
                      is huge, and in fact these units alone have saved
                      the Institutes and Centers tens to hundreds of
                      millions of dollars that would otherwise need to be
                      budgeted in grants for hospital beds and rooms.
                      Don't get me wrong, I fully agree that the pipeline
                      that fuels many or most clinical advances is basic
                      science, and it needs continued high level support.
                      At the same time, however, we also need to remember
                      that the pipeline that takes those discoveries to
                      the clinic is equally important and is greatly
                      dependent on the CTSA's. The latter is, after all,

       It seems to me that a combination of the suggested options will
       work best to keep science alive.
       First, cap indirect costs on grants to no more than 40% with a
       better justification for even that. It is time for universities to
       stop milking the cash cow. It is remarkable how little return the
       actual science gets from this money.
       Second, reduce the salary cap as suggested and start to phase out
       NIH support of pure soft money positions. Two hundred thousand
       dollars a year salaries are not sustainable with the current budget
       climate and are extremely hard to justify to congress critters. It
       is interesting to watch faculty recruiting these days where
       universities will "offer" salaries in this range to soft money
       faculty while a median full professor salary for someone on hard
       money is probably in the range of 130k or so. This has little to do
       with the physician-scientist scenario, in that case most of the
       salary is coming from clinical work anyway.
       Third, by all means cap the yearly support from grants to 1,000,000
       or even 900,000 per year. While one can argue that these most
       productive investigators should be supported (and they should),
       anyone who has ever worked in such a large lab will tell you that
       the large amount of available resources leads to their waste. While
       there is still alot of productively, the "cost per unit science" is
       often much higher than the most productive smaller labs.
       Fourth, allow grant reviewers to incorporate "bang for the buck"
       into the final assignment of priority score. I recently reviewed a
       800,000 per year proposal that would really cost that to complete
       due to the expense of the technique. However, the information
       obtained was probably only really worth 200,000 per year. However,
       I was told that I had to give my priority score without
       consideration to the budget. NIH is the only organization I can
       think of that makes funding decisions without regard to cost
       benefit analysis. It is not that surprising that the funding rate
       for large grants is higher since if a grant has twice the budget,
       of course the PI can get more done.
       Same thing for competing renewals, the reviewers should be told
       what the amount of the prior award was up front and part of the
       priority score of the renewal should explicitly be driven in part
       by a cost/benefit analysis of the prior award instead of a nebulous
       review of "productivity". Grants in the 200K range should not be
       directly compared to 800K behemoths, the expected productivity
       should be scaled.

            I don't want to derail the conversation, and you make a lot of
            interesting and thoughtful points, but I have to take issue
            with this comment on F&A.
            It is remarkable how little return the actual science gets
            from this money.
            Most of what supports the actual science isn't obvious,
            including the need to deal with federal mandates around
            receipt of federal funds, in addition to the usual arguments
            of F&A "keeping the lights on and the floors swept". And
            regardless of what kind of research administrators you have
            (help or hurdle), they're necessary for keeping the university
            (and you) within the federal rules. I've counseled smaller
            companies not to apply for federal grants because they don't
            have the infrastructure to deal with the "cost of ownership".
            When they don't already have it, they can't pre-negotiate
            sufficient overhead to pay for it should the grant be funded.
            Most researchers don't think about the fact that when the
            federal rules aren't satisfied, the grant isn't paid. You the
            researcher don't have to take the time and effort to deal with
            all the "OMB circular #123'' issues when the research
            administrators and OSP accountants, all part of F&A, do their
            jobs.
            For another example, my PhD lab was in an urban, high crime
            setting, and campus security systems and police made a big
            difference in my daily life and ability to do "actual
            science". This kind of thing becomes invisible to us, but F&A
            pays for it. Oh, and when I helped set up a lab for a
            start-up, we had to figure out how to safely dispose of the
            ethidium bromide, and then I really appreciated what F&A paid
            for.

                 This does not explain why NIH pays two different indirect
                 cost rates (32% versus 50%) to two different colleges at
                 my comprehensive university which makes it a big pain to
                 submit a dual PI proposal with PIs appointed in the
                 separate colleges. The campuses abut each other (and the
                 campus centers are less than 1 mile apart). The NIH
                 funded science at the two colleges is similar in scope
                 and there is no apparent difference in costs of doing
                 business (all of the research infrastructure such as
                 safety, research administration and core facilities are
                 shared throughout the university and it is not like one
                 needs more police than the other). I am not arguing that
                 indirect costs are necessary for support infrastructure,
                 what I am arguing is that the mechanism by which rates
                 are calculated is arbitrary. I would propose an equal
                 indirect cost rate across the board, or at least a
                 standard one for urban versus rural institutions if the
                 need for difference is cost of land and policing. One
                 university should not be getting 70%+ in indirect costs
                 while another gets 30% or so.

                 While these comments seem closest to the mark in many
                 ways, I think at least two points of nuance are needed.
                 (1) An F&A rate of 40% is probably unrealistically low;
                 26% is the admin cost component for educational
                 institutions* and has long been known to be below actual
                 costs. (2) The assertion that the physician-scientist
                 scenario is not a concern because "in that case most of
                 the [$$$] are coming from clinical work anyway" is
                 between dubious and ludicrous. I tend to agree that NIH /
                 Congress need in thoughtful ways to reduce the salary cap
                 for non-clinical projects but there would have to be some
                 nuancing or tiering based on clinical activity unless
                 someone wants to amplify an already dangerous trend (the
                 declining pool of research-intensive clinicians for the
                 portion of the NIH mission that involves clinical
                 research, trials, etc.) [aside - I'm not among those
                 blessed with salary cap issues or clinical duties, and
                 yes, I think institutions are going to have to cost-share
                 the salary component better but, realistically, the idea
                 that it will help sustain public support for NIH & its
                 funding of basic science to chase even more clinician
                 researchers off does not strike me as a good one).
                 * I heard once, and have not tracked down clear evidence
                 that the assertion is correct, that free-standing
                 research institutes (non-educational institutions) are
                 NOT subject to the OMB-imposed 26% cap on administrative
                 component of F&A (indirect) costs.
                 If true, one 'small' item (probably worth dozens of extra
                 R01 per year) would be to extend this cap to ALL NIH
                 funding / F&A, not just that for educational
                 institutions. That should be near the top of the
                 "must-do" list [despite the firestorm of push-back from
                 influential / powerful institutes].

       There is no single answer to managing NIH resources to promote a
       broader distribution of funds among investigators. It is the
       responsibility of each institute to manage their portfolio in a
       responsible manner that targets a proportion of the portfolio to
       predetermined areas of interest or of perceived need (by congress
       and/or the research community), while setting aside proportions to
       foster new and young investigators and for work that will continue
       to move a field forward by building on the previous work of others.
       In some cases the work will be of high risk, others will be less
       so, and finally there will be cases of more plodding studies (i.e.,
       work that is more descriptive).
       The institutes have progressively been placed in the position of
       taking a less active role in directly managing their portfolios to
       these ends, instead relying on an inept review system. Reviews
       composed of nothing but terse bullet points offer little
       constructive feedback to the institute (let alone to the PI) to
       judge both the value of the application or of the quality of the
       review. Hence, funding decisions are based almost totally on scores
       with little information to help NIH staff and council members more
       clearly assess what is presented to them by study sections. They
       are thus handcuffed into taking less of an active role in the
       funding process.
       In the distant past, study sections were composed of actively
       funded investigators, a significant proportion of which were either
       deans or department heads. The Chair of study sections actually
       helped to guide the discussions to promote a fair review that
       focused on the importance of the proposed work and/or the unique
       attributes an investigator brings to the table. Due to the combined
       expertise and experience of the panel, reviewers were much less
       likely to get away with biased and unfounded comments that can sway
       the opinions of those members of the panel with less expertise in a
       specific research area. Scientific review officers were also more
       knowledgeable of the areas of research under discussion and played
       an active role in seeing that reviewers actively discussed an
       application leading to as much consensus as possible as to its
       strong and weak points. Yes, critiques were lengthy, requiring
       substantial efforts by reviewers, but they provided a much clearer
       framework for evaluation of the application by the PI, and just as
       importantly, by the institute. The system wasn't perfect, but it
       was certainly more fair, constructive and informative than today's
       system in which the Chair and Review Officer do little more than
       introduce each application and the reviewers produce little
       discussion or reasoning for their scores.
       As I mentioned above, there is no one answer or magic bullet to
       managing the NIH budget to better distribute funds among
       investigators. It will take at least two major steps. These steps
       make the assumption that there are many meritorious applications
       that are currently unfunded.
       First, all of the options listed in the pdf file are viable and
       should be used by each institute to achieve its targeted goal of
       the number of applications to fund. Although, the concept of
       increased limitations on PI salaries will likely incur too much
       resistance and is probably not worth the fight, especially if all
       of the other options come into play. Towards this end the
       institutes will likely need to reassess their administrative
       structure, consider increasing input from the extramural community
       as well as taking a closer and more thorough look at investigator
       progress in non-continuing renewals. Also, each institute must
       increase the expertise of its staff so that it can better evaluate
       submitted applications to actively manage their portfolio to target
       a set number of applications to fund. Such changes will likely
       result in higher administrative costs to NIH, but is a small price
       to pay to increase the number of funded investigators and for
       better grant oversight. A more active role by members of council or
       ad hoc input from the extramural community in combination with NIH
       staff will be needed to help ensure that funds are distributed
       appropriately and fairly.
       Second, the review process has to be improved to better ensure more
       fair, thorough and informative reviews of applications. This will
       require more knowledgable Review Officers that play a more active
       role in the review process. Chairs should not only be experienced
       investigators but also have training in how to guide discussions to
       provide all members of the panel with the basic information needed
       to make a fair decision regarding a proposal, to help reviewers
       come to a consensus, and to stimulate discussion. Review panels
       must be comprised of experienced and active or recently active
       investigators. NIH already recognizes this need as evidenced by the
       carrot of an additional year of funding. But more needs to be done.
       Obtaining an NIH award is not a given right, but should instead be
       considered a passport to joining a community. As such, each member
       of the community has an obligation to ensure the community remains
       strong by contributing to the review process. In other words, if
       you receive an award you are obligated to sit on a review panel at
       least one or more times. The concept that review panels have to
       maintain continuity no longer holds water, as applications are now
       only reviewed no more than twice and panels are composed of as
       nearly as many ad hoc members as permanent members. Suggestions for
       smaller and more focused review panels that utilize newer
       technologies should be given serious consideration. Finally,
       reviewers must provide clear, constructive and informative reviews
       that will assist not only the investigator but also NIH staff and
       members of council.

       Whatever is done should be implemented carefully in a way that the

       permanently shut down excellent to outstanding research by an
       investigator who happened to have a grant renewal due in the lean
       year while other programs ultimately benefit under improved success
       rates. Instituting across the board cuts to all grants in order to
       stabilize paylines and success rates should be a goal assuring that
       (even if at much less dollars) the best research is allowed to
       continue whether it is a noncompeting or competing renewal. Over
       time, the least meritorious (although probably still very good)
       research will be unfunded while the absolute best science will be
       preserved for years to come. In fact, the slow retractions is in a
       way accomplishing this although it is painful. If Congress enacts
       for example a 10% cut in NIH funding in one year, it should come
       first from eliminating new initiatives and then by across the board
       cuts to existing programs allowing new and renewing RPGs to be
       funded at the current success rate with paylines at a minimum of
       10%.

       In the past several years, since the doubling of the NIH budget,
       the bureaucracy at NIH has grown along with the funding. Along with
       this is a correlated growth in the amount of research funding that
       is going to programmatic or solicited research and a decrease in
       the percentage of funds going to investigator initiated research.
       There appears be increasing numbers of contracts and types of
       programs that sound fine when proposed by NIH administrators, but
       often produce lots of data that is of poor quality or is useless
       unless someone with funding takes advantage of that data. These
       data are not included in your published data but intelligent
       estimates suggest it has changed from>60% investigator initiated in
       the 70s to >60% programmatic today. I would like to see the data on
       projected success rate of 50%, 60% or 70% were guaranteed to
       investigator initiated grants, and these analyses might show there
       is not a funding problem just an inappropriate distribution of
       funds. One idea is to set the number of investigator initiated
       awards to ensure a certain success rate and then let program
       compete for the rest to ensure that only the highest quality
       programmatic research gets initiated. As a SS member I can report
       that really productive and important research is not making the
       funding level today and there is nothing we can do to change this
       based on the level of funding and the number of grants that are

       American science and American Universities are great and the system
       of federal funding at NIH and NSF have made that possible . The
       system is not perfect . The greatness is built on the success of
       the funding paradigm a decade or more ago when the budgets were
       about half of what they are now. I remember lobbying with other
       chairman organizations to get the NIH budget up from 7$illion to
       11$Billion and then to double that . What I see is an inflation of
       costs per paper , per discovery. Big science has taken over since
       the human genome project . Yet it was the RO1 mechanism that
       produced so many discoveries . What NIH needs to do urgently is to
       increase the number of RO1 awards . The RO1awards have proved to be
       efficient financially and efficient in producing discoveries. One
       of the greatest factors contributing to American science is the
       number of individual scientists all over the country who were
       supported by RO1s . Without more RO1 awards those individuals will
       not be around, and the young people they train will not be in
       science . We may be resorting to FEMA if NIH cannot restore the
       RO1s to more individual scientists .

       May be I missed something but the solution looks obvious. Instead
       of reducing grant size it is better to reduce number of grants per
       PI. According to recent Nature publication it can be as many as 32
       (!) NIH grant per one PI. And from any of the grant NIH pays
       indirect costs. Why? Usually research teams don't spend more money
       for electricity or heating, they stay in the same space, etc.
       Unfortunately, expanded indirect costs is main problem of NIH
       budget. Its were inflated during previous "good times" and now
       should be reduced leaving more to scientists.

       Create a standard F&A rate (say 45 or 50%), that decreases as an
       institution garners more grant funding after a certain base level
       (maybe $50 million). If F&A is to support the administrative and
       physical infrastructure this makes sense. There should be an
       "economy of scale" in which the second or third $100 million should
       not need as much additional infrastructure or management personnel.
       A standard F&A rate would also save millions in man hours spent on
       cost proposals and eliminate the "gaming" of the system these
       proposals have encouraged. After all, in what other system do you
       "win" by being the least efficient institution with the highest
       rate? With this issue alone billions more would be available for

       Create a truly blind proposal process by eliminating names and

       A big part of the problem is that the current system of "generous"
       indirect rates (whatever else you say about them, there is little
       doubt that they are generous) has encouraged universitites,
       particularly the most research-intensive medical schools, to
       greatly expand in research capacity by building new buildings, in
       the hope that they will be able to attract faculty who will then be
       able to pay rent on the new space through their F&A rates. The
       problems is that they cannot all be winners, and it has created a
       situation where a large fraction of the faculty are supported
       primarily by soft money and thus have an incentive to write a large
       number of grants, many of limited originality, in the hope that at
       least some of the rolls of the dice will be winners. This is not
       the most efficient way to run the scientific enterprise. It leads
       to NIH study sections making de-facto decisions affecting
       scientific careers that are best made by promotions and tenure
       committees.
       What is the solution? Probably will have to include multiple
       approaches, but reducing the overall F&A rates have to be part of
       the solution. That will slow down the frenzy of construction by
       academic medical centers, and while it will result in a marginally
       smaller scientific enterprise, it will be one in which faculty are
       spending most of their time doing research, rather than writing

       Decide which research projects to support, and then fund them at an
       appropriate level. Cover the full costs of NIH research, both
       direct and indirect, consistently and across all programs.
       Federal research agencies often have ambitions that exceed their
       budgets. Program managers routinely approve more research projects
       than can be funded, then provide each project only a fraction of
       the budget needed to carry out the research. They do this in the
       hope that the universities will make up the rest in the form of
       voluntary sharing of direct costs or partial exemption from
       indirect costs.
       Compared to public universities, the NIH is not in a tough budget
       period, sadly. The agency must not solve its problem by shifting
       even more costs to the universities, either through indirect cost
       recovery or increased cost-sharing.
       Universities are already supporting research at a level of $11
       billion nationwide, up from $1.4 billion 25 years ago (see the
       NSF-published research expenditure tables.). The university-funded
       proportion of academic research expenditures covered by
       institutional funds has almost doubled over that period.
       Universities should allocate their resources to fulfill their
       combined missions of education, research and public surface. They
       should not and cannot support a steadily increasing share of
       federally funded research, as they have been.
       Public universities have been hit particularly hard by the effects
       in recent years to move research costs from agencies to the
       universities. State funds have decreased dramatically. Universities
       are already subsidizing NIH research from these reduced university
       funds because the presently assigned indirect cost rates represents
       about 3/4 of full reimbursement. Over the last two decades, the
       government has added a steady stream of new compliance and
       reporting requirements, driving the actual administrative costs
       well over the cap on the reimbursement of those costs.

       In my opinion, the number one priority must be to limit indirect
       cost to institutions. The current system does nothing to encourage
       fiscal responsibility; to the contrary, when an administration
       wants to create a new position, they simply do so, and pass the
       costs on to the F&A calculation. Even the most rudimentary
       knowledge of finance will tell you that cash flow is everything, so
       there is, in fact, an incentive to have a bloated bureaucracy and
       bloated F&A rate. Some institutions (unnamed) have indirect costs
       as high as 99%, which means that for every dollar spent on
       research, a dollar of the NIH budget is not. I would recommend a
       percentage cap on each grant, as well as an absolute cap per
       institution;
       In my opinion, limiting the size of awards is absurd. The cost of
       the proposed research is the cost of the proposed research; do you
       want to fund it or not? Where is that additional money supposed to
       come from if you limit the award? Stop fooling with the system.
       Peer review works. Let peer review rank order the applications,
       then fund what you can, starting from the top. On this latter
       issue, the very clear move towards bureaucratic and political
       decisions about what is or is not important is very dangerous.

       the incentives for the administration to push PIs to write more

       2. Set a `minimum' time effort that PIs can put on their grants.
       Realistically, to have a meaningful input into the project, you
       need to invest 20-25%. If you the NIH will use this number as a

       The current (extraordinarily) loose review standards and

       Summary of main urgings (coded in line with slide 2 of the OER
       slideset):
       A. The current way of managing things is the worst among options.
       "Bottoming out success rates" will not "allow the system to correct
       itself" in any constructive sense*.
       B. Options for "change we can believe in" -
       1a. Preserve and protect full funding of the direct costs of
       modular awards.
       1b. Eliminate the principle of "hard" payline cut-offs for ALL
       investigators; don't just "violate the principle of a hard payline
       cut-off" only for ESI / New PIs.
       (i) preferentially fund the high-rated applications with lower
       total (direct + F&A) costs
       (ii) prioritize highly-rated applications from those labs where the
       research has under-studied features (not just more chasing the same
       molecules or processes as are "hot") and the total of all lab
       funding means that the lab viability requires the award.
       (iii) Apply the cap on administrative costs in F& A at 26% of
       direct costs to ALL recipients of NIH funds if that is not the case
       already.
       2. Place an NIH-wide "hard cap" on the number of RPGs and contracts
       on which one person can serve as PI. Three RPGs & contracts is
       about right (consider exempting R03).
       3. substantially reduce the number of R01's of sizes greater than
       10 modules and larger RPGs (e.g., those over $500,000 direct per
       year); manage all applications for grants over 10 modules so that
       their success rate cannot exceed the pay line or the success rate
       of modular R01 applications.
       4. ("5" - i.e, it's not on NIH OER slide 2) Manage IC portfolio
       balance such that the NIH returns to spending ~39% of its funds on
       R01/R01-equivalent grants (exclusive of U01; U is not R-equivalent,
       it's `cooperative', i.e., managed), and 54-55% of its budget on
       RPGs.
       * "Pax Romana", `They have made a wasteland and called it a
       corrected system' comes to mind.

       AS an experienced reviewer who's seen a lot of grants, I recommend:
       1. Limit the total amount of NIH support that each P.I can assign
       to salary to 50%. this would make institutions pay for their
       faculty, who are often performing a multitude of other tasks and
       making the NIH pay for it. This would prevent institutions from
       over-leveraging their departments, which is part of the reason for
       growth/building boom.
       2. Either cap total amount of NIH support per investigator (the
       tough love approach), or (a more merit based approach) at least
       utilize a sliding scale for success, where each new award has to
       compete at a lower percentile to be funded. (I think GM already
       does this.) I `ve seen enough grants from little labs, big labs,
       and even Nobel Prize winning labs to know that there is a
       diminishing return of creativity, brilliance, and productivity with
       each new award. (see Jeremy Berg's wonderful quantitative study
       that corroborated this.) If we kill off a big fraction of the one
       RO1 labs to keep funding the multimillion dollar operations at
       their current levels, we will lose the generation of scientists
       that would have been trained in all of those smaller labs.

       At the health sciences university where I am a faculty member, the
       "rich" disciplines (i.e., medicine) provide some salary support to
       their faculty for research. The "poor" disciplines, such as
       nursing, cannot do so because of the funding mechanisms built into
       health care. (Most nurse scientists cannot bill insurers for our
       clinical practice, and when we do, our reimbursement is less than
       that of physicians providing the same care. At health sciences
       universities, practice revenues typically fund research and
       education.) Thus, a disparity in research time exists.
       In short, if I don't fund myself, I get a full teaching and service
       load. If I can fund 15% of my FTE, I get a .85 teaching and service
       load.
       Capping salary support for PIs on NIH grants would thus
       disadvantage the "poor" disciplines more than the "rich" ones. I am
       concerned that decreased NIH salary support would contribute to a
       "scientific silencing" of those who are already disadvantaged by
       the lack of alternate revenue streams.

       First, I am delighted the NIH opened up this discussion.
       I stronglyh agree with those who support a cap on indirect rates.
       There is simply no justifiable reason for the high indirect rates
       some insitutuions have managed to negotiate. I suggest that a 50%
       cap would be most appropriate.
       I also agree with limiting the number of awards for any given PI.
       Absent a study that shows that the productivity of an individual
       with 6 RO1's is 3 times that of individuals with 2 RO1s it would
       seem prudent to limit the total awards per PI.
       Interestingly none in the debate have addressed the type of
       research being funded by NIH. In light of the current limitations
       on financial resources for NIH, and the prospect of further
       limitations, it would seem now is the time to examine carefully
       what areas of research the NIH should be funding. Each and every
       academic investigator and administrator can make strong arguments
       for their own particular area of research being a priority. But are
       blanket reductions across the research landscape the best way to
       handle shrinking resources? To insure that a priority is given
       toward research directly affecting the health of the American
       people will also require limitations on funding of research that
       does not.

            The problem with this is that there are already too many
            people dictating what should be studied that have no business
            making those decisions IMHO. Congress isn't willing to
            allocate more money to the NIH and doesn't see the benefit in
            science, but wants to determine how much money should be spent
            on autism, or Alzheimers. (Not that these aren't fine areas,
            of course.)
            Basic science has produced important advances without being
            directed. The NIH funds research that is to be beneficial to
            public health and the scientists help decide which projects
            fit that bill and are good science. This system seems good to
            me.
            In this regard alone I am actually a conservative and want
            less directional oversight. Fund good scientists to do good
            science and good things will come of it. Trying to make us all

       In the current budget situation, I think it is crucial to also

       colleague of mine was notified yesterday that his A1 application

       this as a new A0.
       For the writers above who say modifications on how RO1 grants are
       paid will not be "merit based". Can you honestly say that a grant
       scoring in the top 12% is not meritorious while a grant scoring 9%
       is??? That is certainly not my experience as a study section
       member.
       If NIH still wants to keep the "only one revision" policy, I am OK
       with that. However, there still should be an opportunity to submit
       such a project as a new application. I also understand the concern
       about reducing the load on review so maybe sending in such a grant
       as a new application could be restricted to those getting 25% or
       better on the A1 review??? Either way, the current policy is not
       only failing to get excellent science funded, it is permanently
       shutting down projects found to be highly meritorious by peer

       As a junior investigator, I had a couple of thoughts to contribute.
       First, I think that the debate regarding indirect costs is pretty
       obvious here. It needs to be a flat rate, and much lower than it
       currently is at many institutions.
       Secondly, semi-selfishly, I am in concurrence regarding the
       limiting of awards per PI.
       Effective management of funds, scientific "bang for the buck," and
       effective mentoring of junior researchers seems to reach a point of
       diminishing returns after several awards. I can say this from my
       experience postdocing in a megalab where at least tens of thousands
       of dollars were wasted per year and several scientific careers
       ended due to a severe lack of mentorship. Again, there are
       exceptions to this rule, but I believe that they are the outliers
       in the grand scheme. I am not one to say what this limit should be,
       but it should definitely exist.
       For those of you saying that this is an unreasonable request, I
       would say that instead of creating mega-labs, perhaps this PI
       funding limitation would create greater collaboration within our
       research community. When good science needs to be accomplished
       cost-effectively (I'm not saying without funds, just less), the
       good PI's will find a way.

       What makes you think that the A1 policy on revision was anything
       other than a response to the current budget situation? Did you miss
       the prior discussion on this blog after the Benezra/Noonan comments
       on the revision policy? Your colleague's situation is indeed
       sad....but every indication is that this is the intentional outcome
       from the NIH perspective. They need to shrink the pool of applicant
       PIs. And this is not really a huge difference in approach. There
       were always near-miss scores [351]in the grey area which Program
       passed over. Scores which were the PI's only grant....or scores
       which would have become the noob PI's first grant.
       Why should we feel any more sorry for ourselves that this line is
       now in the 12-15%ile range instead of the 18-20%ile range?
       If Program refuses to pick up a near-miss score from an established
       investigator who has a history with them....well, they are making a
       decision to reduce the pool. Or else they are deciding that this PI
       can survive until she comes up with a more interesting proposal.
       What they are not doing is making an error (according to their
       goals, not yours) because they had no idea what changing to a
       A1-and-out policy would do.

                      This is an excellent point about the typical career
                      arc. My completely subjective view suggests that
                      there have been, in the past, many good
                      investigators who labored mightily for their first
                      5-10 years trying to build funding, staff, capacity,
                      models and a scientific program. When they hit their
                      mid40s or so, things reached the exponential phase
                      that last about 15 years. The models were humming,
                      the research projects were turning into programs,
                      the trainees come a-running and, in the past, they
                      were able to load up on a good deal of sustained NIH
                      funding. A lot of great papers resulted. In part
                      because they no longer had to really worry about
                      getting the next grant when they needed it and in
                      part because they were able to compete for multiple
                      awards and a fairly hefty amount of total support.
                      Now this demographic is squeezed. The proposals in
                      this thread to soak the rich / cap total awards
                      prevents the mid-career scientists of approximately
                      GenerationX from blossoming like the previous
                      generation was able to do. Yes, even though they are
                      meritorious because of the aforementioned
                      development of their programs. The emphasis on the
                      ESI (which is a good thing) further saps their
                      ability to fully realize their efforts. And the top
                      end of nearly emeritus faculty is refusing to

                      stipulation for eligibility is to conduct research
                      in that country. Likewise, all of my colleagues who
                      are PI's in the US, but citizens of another are no
                      longer eligible for funding from their home
                      countries. With such a situation, I find it
                      difficult to justify letting such a large amount of
                      meritorious research in conducted in the US go
                      unfunded, while at the same time sending research
                      funds to countries that as a rule do not fund

                      innovative research ideas within the US that are

       Why do the proposed options to manage NIH resources exclude the
       costs of grant administration at NIH? Do we really need that many
       research officers etc. at such high salaries to essentially push
       grant papers around? How about cutting the number of these
       positions significantly and swiftly re-direct the saved money into
       research funding?
       Cap the indirect costs because they are the legal way of
       institutions to milk (and rip off) the government. Every foundation
       caps indirect costs, why not NIH? 50% of NIH funds go to only 20%
       of the investigators? Wow, even these "star scientists" cannot
       honestly predict that their research will bring the next
       break-through in science because discovery research is a high-risk
       enterprise. Therefore, NIH would be smart to spread the risk of its
       investment among MORE RO1 investigators.
       This could be achieved by demanding a significant minimum amount of
       effort (e.g. 30%) a PI must spend on a project.
       Limiting the amount of total funds per PI is another good option
       and would reduce the support of "Manhattan projects" by NIH. For
       example, clinical trials are too expensive to be supported by NIH.
       What has become too risky and expensive for many Pharmaceuticals,
       should not be funded with taxpayer's money, certainly not in these
       dire times.
       Capping the salaries of PI would mainly affect the physicians in
       research because very few PhD scientists will ever get close to the
       existing salary cap. I am in favor of this cap because, apart from
       saving money for NIH, it would remove the current salary
       discrimination against PhD scientists by NIH.

            Well, Lorenz, if all POs did was push grant paper around, as
            you assert, then I should be replaced by a GS 10 clerk
            tomorrow. The fact is that my colleagues and I spend very
            little time pushing any paper around at all. Most of our time
            is spent advancing public health. Administratively, we help
            PIs respond to unanticipated problems and discuss new projects
            to move the field forward. Scientifically, we spend time
            recruiting talented investigators (both new and seasoned) to
            apply for NIH grants - often bringing in talent from outside
            healthcare to solve public health problems. We also write
            journal articles to help the research community learn about
            the nation's public health research needs, and promote
            awareness of NIH research findings that might inform ongoing
            studies or encourage new applications for research grants. As
            public health officials, POs also spend a lot of time helping
            get research implemented into everyday healthcare by meeting
            with outside government agencies and helping bring together
            private sector healthcare providers and grantees. POs also
            keep IC management informed so they can keep Congress
            informed. Now and then, we do progress reports and other
            administrative stuff, but that work contributes to
            accountability -- not so much to improving public health. The
            diversity of support POs provided NIH not only requires a
            doctoral education, in most branches is also requires decades
            of research and implementation experience before moving from
            the bench to grants administration. Are we overpaid? Not based
            on the job offers I get from outside NIH.

       Here are few suggestions.
       1. The institutions should invest at least 50% of the salary. This
       way institution are responsible for the success of the PI. In the
       absence of institution commitment, these PI become a parasite on
       the NIH system and submit many grants to support their salary and
       basic necessities and overburdens NIH system.
       2. Administrators are generally not interested in the PI's science
       as much as they are interested in indirects. If the indirect's are
       reduced by few dollars everyone is after the PI. If you need to get
       the science done, you need to reduce the indirect costs may be as
       low as 30%. The existence of this blog is manifesto that there are
       many willing and meritorious PI's who are willing to take funding
       and do science. So the argument that institution would not conduct
       research if indirect's are reduced is not a valid argument.
       3. Most of the time a PI feels that he/she is working for the
       indirects and not the direct cost of the budget.
       4. The PI salary should not be charged multiple times from the tax
       payer to facilitate the other functions of the enterprise.
       Specifically true for state institutions when salary is a line item
       in the state budget and is also charged to the grants. Leaves a lot
       of salary, fringe, indirects for administration to fund other
       operations as that money is never returned to the state.

       limiting NIH support of salaries, and limiting indirect costs. This
       may even have the effect of increasing the return on the

       I'm late to the discussion, but looking at the slides and having
       thought about this a lot I think the best solutions are:
       1. Ask medical schools/institutions to kick in at least 50% salary.
       They can take some of that from the indirects.
       2. Limit the amount of funding for a PI to $800,000 and/or limit
       the number of grants.
       3. The indirects are outrageous. I get that the University needs
       money to do maintenance and keep the lights on, but why should the
       scientists shoulder that load for the rest of the departments that
       don't bring in grant money? (At least at primarily undergraduate
       institutions).
       I see people gripe about this not being "a merit based system" if
       we implement restrictions on funds, but I disagree with that idea.
       My science is solid and I publish well and yet I am struggling to
       get enough money to run my lab. 1 R01 is all I need to keep going,
       but it will never be enough for me to hire 20 postdocs to run a
       factory. It's barely enough to hire one. So yes someone with more
       than $1,000,000 a year can outproduce me and my 200K budget because
       they can pay for next gen sequencing, and multiple postdocs, and
       microarray experiments. They will continue to look more and more
       stellar while I appear to be solid but not adventuresome. And this
       comes back into play because I can't compete with that on "merits".
       That's life, but I resent the idea bandied around in these comments
       by some that somehow because I am struggling, it's all my fault
       because I must be a marginal scientist. I don't think we should
       give money to bad science just to be fair, but spreading the money

       more inclusively seems like a good idea for everyone.

       There are clearly many opinions about indirect rates. How about

       For a start non RO1 grants could cap indirect rates, and any

       preference thresholds so that fiscally well managed institutions
       with lower rates would have a better chance for those supplements.

       Long-term I support an HHMI- or Welcome-style system where PIs are
       judged every five years based on strictly on productivity. Want to
       try something risky? You have five years to get it to work and then
       you're judged. Want a larger lab? Be more productive and apply to
       move up to a higher `track'. This will allow the system to plan

       I believe that it is a great idea to cap the number of grants per

       the productuvity is not proportional to the number of grants or the
       size of each grant. Ther are too much waste in big labs while
       others are struggling to keep their labs. The science as a nation
       cannot just depend on few labs. Creativity comes from cometition in
       big pools. I also agree with the idea that indirect cost should be
       reduced, particularly for those institutions with more than 60%
       indirect cost. There are excessive administration staff and salary
       in many institutions which can be significantly reduced. For
       instance, the salary of our adminidtrators got doubled or even
       tripled in the last couple of years. We have no idea how indirect

       I've read a number of comments here, but none seem to be addressing
       what I see as the main issue. How many scientists do we need, or
       want, as a society? The current system is unsustainable - the
       growth in the potential number of PIs is exponential and the
       dollars are not. To some extent, we can force ourselves to do more
       with less. But that only goes so far, and reduces what we can do.
       The main message is clear, either the funding stream needs to
       increase, or the number of scientists needs to decrease. There is
       no point in training graduate students and postdocs in either a big
       lab or a small lab if they are not going to find a job. The mission
       of NIH is to get the science done. This is not the same as NSF,
       which has a training/education mission. NIH should continue to fund
       the best science.
       I hate the idea of losing excellent scientists. But the system
       simply cannot support the number of scientists we are training.
       While the recent programs that benefit younger PIs are great (for
       them, at least temporarily), they are nothing more than Band-aids,
       that push the problem off a few years. As was mentioned by others,
       what happens at renewal time? No favoritism then. Yes, most
       scientists do their most productive, creative work in their younger
       years. This doesn't mean that they are useless to the research
       enterprise as they age. Or are they? Is this the goal? Get a good
       ten years out of them and then hope they fade away? My gut tells me
       the young PI initiatives were put in place with the expectation
       that things would get better by the time renewals came around. Well
       guess what...? In fact, the young PI initiatives are making things
       worse. Numerous young faculty get jobs and tenure, and then are
       firmly in the system...and then research funds dry up. We need a
       sustainable model. A good place to start would be to eliminate the
       ideal of infinite growth. In other words, REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NEW
       FACULTY HIRES! Yes, hire enough to sustain the system and the
       scientific enterprise, but that's it. Supply far exceeds the
       demand. NSF and NIH should work together on this to reduce the
       graduate student pool. So, who will do the work in the lab? Well, I
       find that the best most productive scientists are senior postdocs,
       or super-postdocs/mid-career scientists. Instead of sending them to
       industry, why not keep them in academic labs? Yes, they may cost a
       bit more, but they are much more productive.
       Now as depressing as the above may sound, I hope that we don't go
       that route. I've heard the arguments that we need many more STEM
       graduates. But the only way society is going to get these people is
       if there are funds to pay for them. This gets back to what I said
       at the beginning - how many scientists do we need, or want, as a
       society? Otherwise, it's just a bubble, and it's bursting
       now...Write your Congressmen/Senators and ask them what they see as
       the future of the medical establishment.

       also be useful to fix overhead cost rates to approximately 50%.
       Some special funding initiatives should be available as well for

       1) All this talk about F&A is irrelevant because these rates are
       negotiated with the institutions' cognizant agency (DHHS or ONR),
       and OMB has made it clear that agencies can not demand cost share,
       which is what they would be doing if they tried negotiating F&A
       rates on grants. (There are exceptions, including training capped
       at 8% and USDA's weird calculations- all congressional decisions).
       I think NIH is looking for suggestions on things they can actually
       control.
       2) Choice of funding mechanisms (R01, P01, etc.), capping the
       number of grant awards to a PI (or an organization?), and
       considering the use of targeted (RFA) versus solicited are things
       under NIH control, but how about thinking creatively about changing
       research paradigms? Should NIH move more upstream or downstream in
       their funding focus? Perhaps there should be more emphasis in NSF
       funding basic research and NIH on more applied (clinical and
       population). Reduce training and career grants and focus on
       research? A major change would be to switch to a cost-reimbursement
       model rather than a prospective project model. (probably something
       only Congress could decide.) Perhaps grant applications should
       include a plan for outreach to unfunded researchers to support
       networks of collaborators to spread the money around. Can some of
       these massive lab-factories become regional research resources for
       smaller institutions?
       3) I replied to a comment above that I thought the research
       community is too large to be sustainable, even with continued
       increases in NIH funding. We have seen the problems with allowing

       In order to bring much-needed fairness and transparency to the NIH
       funding system, I suggest the following:
       (1) NIH should cap the dollar support to each PI at $400K/year.
       Additional money is just a waste as it rarely leads to any
       improvement in scientific productivity.
       (2) NIH must abolish all indirect costs and leave the
       responsibility of providing research infrastructure and
       administration to the awardee institutions. The indirect costs
       simply allow these institutions to put their money (that could be
       used toward research infrastructure and administration) either into
       the pockets of deans (the one percenters) or simply waste them on
       paying salaries of unnecessary administrators and bureaucrats,
       whose job is nothing but interference with the smooth flow of good
       science.
       (3) The awardee institutions must pay 100% salaries of PIs.
       (4) An institution that does not meet the above requirements should
       be considered unfit to conduct NIH-funded research and should not
       be funded with NIH money.
       Just some thoughts! But I know it will take a lot more than just
       some thoughts to make NIH a fair system. In the meantime, let the
       devil rule. The power lies with corporations that the medical

       It's discouraging to hear comments saying that we SHOULD limit the
       number of people coming into science. Many in our society (and
       probably all of us in this discussion) think that science and
       technology are critical to maintain a competitive edge in the
       realms of economics, politics, and innovation. As such, broad
       efforts to attract students into STEM disciplines have been ongoing
       and largely successful in recent years. However, the current
       funding NIH system (though I think this applies to NSF and other
       agencies as well) sets up a pyramidal scheme, where far more are
       recruited into science than have a hope of surviving. As a (so far)
       successful PI, I have been asked repeatedly by graduate students at
       my institution and those I visit "What kind of careers should we
       look for since there aren't jobs as PIs?". There is a widespread
       and becoming-true sense that there isn't much of a future in
       investigative science. Is this really what we want?
       Darwinian evolution works beautifully for actual evolution, and
       "many are called, but few are chosen" is a fine mantra for many
       fields. Science that is funded by taxpayer dollars should
       absolutely be competitive, to ensure that our money is well spent
       on research that is deemed significant and appropriately conducted.
       However, in the current climate, everyone acknowledges that truly
       excellent science simply isn't being funded due to budget
       limitations; many here have commented how a funded 6% grant is
       indistinguishable from an unfunded 14% grant. I hear many
       colleagues on study sections lament that the top 20% or so of
       applications are all terrific, but with paylines of ~10% or less,
       most go unfunded.
       This is a serious long-term problem, and NIH resource management
       strategies could help. The current approach will ensure that the
       minority of investigators who receive most of the money will
       thrive, while we not only lose the rest but discourage young people
       from entering our field. Have we gone to so much effort to recruit
       youth into science only to now close the door? It will be
       phenomenally difficult to bring them back again when our budgets
       improve down the road.
       Imposing some kind of limits on funding to individual investigators
       seems to be the most viable survival strategy. One good example in
       the OER presentation is limiting PIs to two R01s, which would add
       nearly 1000 funded applications. That represents nearly a thousand
       PIs who would stay in science, or new PIs coming into our field.
       NOte that at current paylines, this doesn't require funding "anyone
       who wants to do science"; there are plenty of excellent
       applications just beyond the paylines waiting to be funded.
       Similarly, shifting the allocation of NIH funds from large
       contracts and centers (which largely give more money to those who
       already have it rather than funding individual scientists) to
       individual or multi-PI RPGs would also support a broad foundations
       of researchers. Individual basic and clinical researchers are the
       life blood of investigative science, and keeping more of them in
       the field is a better strategy for surviving and thriving than
       completely letting the current "market" forces persist.

       When the NIH budget was doubled, there were two trends that now
       haunt us: 1) the large research Universities built more buildings,
       all of which have to be maintained, and filled with researchers. 2)
       They hired soft money researchers, expecting them to be self funded
       in perpetuity. Both mean that responsibilities for maintenance and
       for faculty salary got shifted from the Universities to the NIH. In
       most countries in the world, Professors get a salary that is
       stable, and a few technical staff and/or students/postdocs to be
       able to do a limited amount of work without extra funding.
       It is time that the Universities are told: take responsibility! If
       you hire someone, he is yours to mentor, foster and pay, and your
       risk. So, I applaud Francis Collins et al. who are saying 50% of a
       Professors salary has to come from the University - or a maximum of
       50% can come from NIH - whichever. Just like the economy and the
       housing boom, the Universities relied on an ever increasing NIH
       funding availability, and that is wrong. Although I now have an
       "outstanding" grant that will likely not get funded, I don't sign
       the many calls for asking senators and representatives to not cut
       NIH. I appeal to all the professional organisations to appeal to
       their own Universities to take back the responsibility for their
       faculty, to end the spiral of unsustainable growth.
       It is not essential to have 80% indirect costs. So, a
       nonnegotiated, flat indirect cost rate of maybe 35% seems easy to
       implement - there is no right a University has for NIH Dollars, so
       they can't sue NIH. They can move some indirects into directs, but
       fair enough. We know that most Universities give kick-backs based
       on indirects, so they aren't ALL necessary!
       Another suggestion is a different measure of productivity: Papers
       per $100K. As someone above said, rich labs use a lot of money but
       not judiciously, and getting really good science done at low cost
       is better than very expensive science. That said, of course,
       clinical trials, and certain animal experiments are inheritantly
       more expensive. But some papers are also harder to get - so the
       correct metric of papers/grant, when people with multiple grants
       are allowed to double dip (mention several grants in each paper),
       is not fair either.

       Your analysis is correct but your plea for improvement fails.
       Because you are confusing an inability of the system as it is now
       to distinguish with the reality that a very large percentage of
       submitted applications really do not differ on any possible
       objective metric that we might think of as scientific merit. As
       assessed in advance of the conduct of the work, of course.
       There is no objectively better way to select the subset of
       proposals the NIH can afford. Pursuit of your pipe dream would be a
       dangerous distraction from the real job at hand which is trying to
       set priorities. Priorities for who is going to take the hit and who
       is going to benefit. Which way will the study section table slant?
       Will we try to keep the current infrastructure alive? or try to
       shrink it down by a significant amount? New Assistant Professors?
       or shall we eke out another 5 years from those nearing retirement?
       Basic, translational or clinical? Are we after therapies or Nobel
       prizes? Incremental advance? or big-splash papers that might turn
       out to be completely unimportant later?
       IMO, this is what we should be discussing. Priorities and hard

            (Admittedly, some were arrogant jerks.) Their job is difficult

            institutes will view as low priorities. The research community

       To address potential solutions to the current and evolving funding
       situations, the following approaches may be worth considering:
       1. Emphasize more on partnering between pharmaceutical and biotech
       companies with academic institutions and NIH to fund basic and
       clinical research.
       2. Establish a process for co-funding between the NIH and industry.
       3. Home institutions should consider paying a major portion of
       salaries of established investigators, who have shown an excellent
       record of scientific contribution and continuous external funding.
       This will free up federal grant money (salaries) for more research
       and/or supporting more grants.
       4. Consolidate various programs at the NIH to increase RO1-type
       grants and monitor research outcome of R21 and RO3 and other big
       programs, and if necessary, eliminate these categories.
       5. There needs to be a more efficient use of NIH funds. For
       example, indirect costs may be on a sliding scale for individuals
       with multiple grants and re-direct those funds to pay new research
       grants. It is time to seriously consider limiting the number of
       major grants an investigator can hold. Also, productivity of
       individuals holding multiple grants should be critically assessed
       in terms of scientific contribution against dollar amount.
       6. It is time to eliminate bureaucracy and multiple layers of
       administrative responsibilities within the NIH and home
       institutions for administering grant review process and funding to
       reduce administrative costs.
       7. Build strong grass-root advocacy groups for public and
       congressional awareness to the importance of basic and
       translational research and build a strong campaign for increased
       NIH funding.
       8. Start with a "Million Scientists March" to Washington, DC,
       involving scientists, educators, graduate students, postdoctoral
       fellows, research personnel, people from biotech and pharmaceutical
       companies, and citizens who care for scientific discoveries that
       improve human health and quality of life. This approach will
       educate the society at large, draw the attention of decision-making
       bodies and raise the stature of scientific research and the
       benefits society reaps from it.

            The problem with suggestions like this is that the bureaucracy

            to complay with calls from Congress for oversight of taxpayer

            that those reports represent the tip of the iceberg for the

                 because of fears that someone would be "stealing" or
                 inappropriately using grant funds. Yes, some of the high
                 profile cases involving federal grant funds that have
                 come to light in the past decade are shocking, however, I
                 don't see how they could ever happen at an institution
                 with minimal accounting controls. Certainly my
                 institution is on top of this to an extreme extent.
                 I came to the realization that the auditing has gone out
                 of hand when I was site visited (a day visit in my lab)
                 by an NIH official because I received a $4,000 ARRA
                 supplement to support an undergraduate. They interviewed
                 the student extensively and my entire lab about his
                 project. I was greatly puzzled by this but the program
                 officer said that they were required to site visit these
                 awards to ensure I did not just hire my nephew or
                 something. Really, for a $4,000 (not a misprint) award???
                 How many more awards could have been made without the
                 site visits?
                 Even more recently, as part of an audit of one of my NIH
                 grants I was questioned about a $20 charge for five
                 bottles of nail polish and had to write an extensive
                 essay justifying why we use this in my research (and yes
                 we really do). (and no, I am not being targeted due to
                 some prior impropriety, I have had completely clean
                 accounts for 15 years)
                 Yes, we don't want NIH funds misappropriated, but here
                 the auditing costs much more than even any potential
                 misappropriation. Something has happened to any possible
                 sense of perspective here.

       Seasoned Reviewer wrote that he/she has always wondered how
       institutions whose faculty is entirely on soft money can afford to

       afford new buildings precisely because of the money they save by
       not paying salaries. This starts a positive feedback cycle that
       siphons big money out of NIH because when new buildings and other
       facilities are added, higher indirect cost rates can be negotiated
       with NIH. NIH may want to reconsider this policy and put some
       breaks on this "death" loop.
       I am not in favor of limiting the number of awards per PI because
       some grants are small, like RO3s, which only provide $50K/year. I
       confirmed with NIH Resource Management that their grant limit
       calculations included small grants.
       Limiting the amount of $ per year makes more sense. When labs get
       too big, the return in research quality can diminish. I checked
       with NIH Resource Management to see whether the numbers they ran
       were based on direct costs only or direct + indirect and found that
       they include indirect costs. So a million bucks a year for a PI
       boils down to about 2 R01s + an R21, assuming indirect costs of
       ~60%. That sounds pretty reasonable. I've always been a fan of
       quality rather than quantity in science. Limiting $ forces PIs to
       focus on their best stuff and levels the playing field.

            @ Old Timer -- Thank you for seeking & posting clarification
            of a few key points.
            Definitely, while it is vital that NIH implement limitations
            of various sorts (even if the "Gang of 12'' / JCDR does reach
            an agreement and NIH is spared the 7.8% automatic cut or a cut
            from the JCDR agreement), the changes have to be done
            carefully and thoughtfully. Small awards should be excluded
            from a cap. Unfortunate but understandable that they used
            total (direct + F&A), in which case the ~$400,000 cost is a
            10-module R01 with ~ average F&A. It should not be just two
            awards, or if so should definitely exclude small awards and no
            cost extension ("Active") awards [which no longer hit the NIH
            budget / cash flow]. Indeed, I'd argue it should be a cap on
            all NIH grants & contracts, not JUST RPGs.
            But Drug Monkey is right that a huge problem with using a
            total $$$ cap (as opposed to one on the number of awards,
            ideally, capping number of all substantive grants & contracts)
            is that the NIH must maintain a broad and diversified
            portfolio, and different types of essential research have
            different costs. Unfortunately, a sub-text in all of this is
            that analysis of the changes in portfolio allocation supports
            the view that in the past decade, a substantial shift in
            portfolio allocation has preferentially steered resources into
            a set of "resource-building" exercises at much higher unit
            cost. If limited, or if taking place when the budget is
            growing, big bets on "bigger science" [GWAS ! Encyclopedias of
            (Cancer, Brain, etc) Genomes / Exomes ! ] can be great, but
            the resource shift is now destroying the diversity of research
            base. The same problem now challenges the long-time assumption
            that decisions should be made independent from selecting
            awards on the basis of lower F&A costs. Really, things need to
            move toward selections biased against higher costs, i.e.,
            within a reasonable tier of indistinguishable percentiles,
            with a careful eye on program fit and NIH-wide `uniqueness'
            (not just within one IC making that one fund /not fund
            decision).

       Some of the early comments note use of indirect costs for building
       maintenance, etc, as if this were typical. If that is true, my
       institution is quite atypical, as I get billed for routine
       facilities repairs (leaky faucets, etc.) I think this kind of thing
       SHOULD be covered by indirect costs. On the other hand, a
       significant portion of indirect costs gets distributed to vice
       chancellors, deans, and departments (but none to individual faculty
       members). Some of the IDC funding goes to the library; a limited
       amount provides seed funding directed specifically to developing
       P01s (program project grants). At the departmental level, funding
       from other sources is so tight that the indirect costs that make it
       that far down the totem pole are simply absorbed into the general
       budget. There seems to be no general across-universities use of
       these funds.
       I wonder if perhaps the issue of widely varied IDC rates, even
       among institutions in the same city, could be addressed in the same
       way that the federal government manages travel per diems: Simply
       specify a rate for each city/region, bearing in mind operating
       costs for that locale, and allow no variation from that rate. This
       will provide some degree of control over the variability in IDC
       rates among institutions.

       "picking up the slack" wherever possible in all of the above cases.
       Finally, exorbitant indirect costs to some of the more `entitled'
       institutions should be renegotiated to a considerably lower rate.
       There is no reason, for instance, that a firmly endowed institution
       like Harvard should receive much higher indirects than the less
       well positioned. These funds could be used to fund many new

       I am in favor of the following steps:
       o Reduce number of large payout grants, i.e., those in excess of $1
       million. The scientific community needs to learn to do more with
       less. We are better off distributing funds to
       a larger pool of qualified investigators rather than piling up
       money on a lucky few.
       o Reduce PI salaries. Universities/Institutions should be paying
       the majority of salaries. NIH will get more bang for its buck by
       paying grad student and postdoc salaries. Paying large PI salaries
       is not an effective use of limited government funds.
       o Re-negotiate indirect cost rates. The government is currently
       getting ripped off here. The claim was made above that the majority
       of F&A costs are used for space, lighting, heating, etc. Baloney.
       If you calculate the space and resource usage needed to conduct
       research for a $1M grant it comes no where close to $500k, which is
       at the lower end of what most universities charge. Good office
       space in most cities can easily be acquired for $25/sqft/year. Now
       be generous and allow for a 2000 sq ft. lab. That comes to
       $50k/year, or $250k for a five year grant period. And this all
       assumes that this grant is the sole source of income for the lab,
       which it probably isn't. So universities have alot to answer for in
       charging these outrageous amounts.
       Mostly they are wasting precious government resources on bloated

       mentoring abilities. This will not only ensure that the funding
       goes ONLY to the most deserving and qualified mentors but will also
       encourage better mentoring of a future generation of scientists.
       2. Have a stricter policy on international travel for PIs and curb
       the amount of money spent behind it. Many PIs with large grants are
       constantly traveling to exotic locations to meet up with
       `collaborators'. In today's age of communication, this can
       definitely be minimized.

       Indirect costs should be a constant for all institutions. This
       would reward efficiency and avoid abuses of the system.
       The NIGMS system of having a soft cap on overall grant support from
       all sources is a good model. It is supported by their survey of
       research productivity for labs as a function of support. Yet it
       allows exceptions for particularly compelling new grant
       applications from well funded investigators, but holds these new
       applications to a higher standard.

       I think we need to focus on challenges at a higher level than
       cutting indirect costs. As a post-doc, you see every day that there
       are too many people in the system-unless the NIH budget grows by
       2-3x. We need to start pushing the knowledge out into the world.
       How can we drive more biological knowledge and technology into
       inventions/services which do good or create value and take pressure
       away from the academic system?
       What about making it easier for academic scientists to pursue their
       ideas in the private sector? What about giving a series of
       "soft-landing grants", grants that would fund a return to research
       life after founding a for-profit or non-profit venture? After so
       many years of training, it is very difficult for professors of even
       post-docs to leave academic jobs and try to push a research project
       out into the world. If it fails, it is hard to come back. By the
       time, we have the training to know biology deeply, people often
       have young families.
       The NIH should award 20-100 soft-landing grants that would fund a
       return to academic life for a researcher who wants to push a
       technology out into the world. These could be prestigious-like
       pioneer awards-or work at the RO1 level-just like HHMI, funds a
       return to normalcy for un-renewed investigators.
       In the short-term, this would require funds. I believe-in the
       medium term-it would create opportunities for more people with
       advanced training in the life-sciences to follow and work in for
       profit or non-profit ventures that are pushing our work out into
       the broader world.

       I was shocked that PIs have to spend all of their money before the
       deadline, because they are afraid of the negative implication of
       not having spent it all. The result is to buy a bunch of things
       that they don't need at the last minute in order to appear to have
       needed it all. This is wasteful. What if saving money became a
       positive incentive instead of a negative one? How about offer a
       guaranteed year extension with bonus, added bonus points on the
       next grant application, a larger percentage cut for the school, a
       boost to a higher tier for grant consideration for those who cut
       their cost by 40% and requested an extension? I see a lot of waste
       that could be utilized better by multiple scientists. I think that
       there are ethical implications that also need an overhaul. Because
       grants are so competitive, this may just be the time to tackle the
       beast and reform the system.
       Here are a couple of more ideas...
       1) How about offering incentives to decrease time of training
       graduate students. I believe that it can be done in 3.5-4.5 years,
       but many PIs are stretching it out because they don't have the time
       and schools will cover it.
       2) Increase incentives (points on grants) to train graduate
       students over holding onto higher paid postdocs for too many years.
       3) Tighten the rules on expenditures and offer reward for
       whistleblowing!
       4) Don't fund scientist, institutions or organizations that with
       big ethical violations and problems. Make ethics a category for
       grant competitions.

       What concerns me most viewing the data and the comments posted thus
       far is that any plan to deal with diminishing NIH funding will
       ultimately be pitting established, well-funded investigators
       against new investigators, using the well worn arguments of quality
       versus quantity and diversity.
       Fact:
       20% of the PIs get 50% of the funds.
       Fact:
       We can decide to keep funding the scientists that receive most of
       the funding under the assumption this maximizes "quality" or we can
       decide to redistribute funding to optimize quantity and diversity
       and find out how it affects quality.
       Given the evidence that startup companies have provided most of the
       job growth in the US over the last decade, not to mention most of
       the creativity and innovation as well, I for one feel it is time to
       embrace quantity and diversity in NIH funding as I am confident it
       will only enhance quality and innovation in the end.

       Over the past 20 years we have built an unsustainable system built
       on the need for more and more dollars to fund our factories that
       "grow" more and more researchers who cannot find jobs so they
       languish for years as post-doctoral fellows.
       The system is seriously flawed as the best scientists are pulled
       from the laboratory to spend more and more time being "politicians"
       instead of scientists and training more and more students/fellows
       who cannot get jobs. Further, any system that encourages
       post-doctoral fellowships of more than 2 or 3 years with any single
       specific primary mentor is fatally flawed. If a mentor cannot
       complete the training of a post-doc in a few years, do we really
       think that we will impart knowledge more efficiently in the next 6
       years?
       With dollars growing ever more tight, I suggest that we need to
       create strictly enforced rules that limit each PI of federal grants
       to no more than a few (say 5) students and post-docs supported in
       whole or in part via federal funds at a time. Teeth should be added
       that will eliminate all federal research funding for
       departments/labs/PIs who try to circumvent this rule. This will
       break up the oligarchies that have developed across science and
       encourage PIs to stop being managers and to return to what we
       generally do best - science. It will also allow scientists to focus
       more on mentoring the students/fellows working with them so that
       they can impart the lessons to be learned in a period of no more
       than 2 or 3 years.
       This will free up enormous sums of money, much more than the salary
       limits now being enforced. These funds can then be provided to
       younger independent scientists with fresh ideas and the energy to
       engage in science and not become managers.

       The biggest drain on NIH resources stems mainly from issues related
       to salary support. Institutions no longer want to pay for their
       faculty (even though their faculty have responsibilities beyond
       their research) and push them to obtain, often times, 100% of their
       salaries from NIH research grants. I understand that for many
       extramural NIH researchers their main functions on campus are to do
       research, but placing large chunks, or all, of those salaries
       including fringe, on 250K annual budgets is a significant drain on
       monies that actually get directed to do the research. Funding is
       extremely competitive, clocks are ticking extraordinarily fast, and
       larger personnel costs to get the job done in an efficient manner
       are impeding the amount of actual dollars that go towards the
       research. Unfortunately, I think the only way to fix this will be
       to require institutes to make greater salary commitments to their
       faculty. (heck they own a portion of whatever IP we develop don't
       they?)

       Before thinking about how to mange NIH funds, we should review what
       the aims of these funds are. It seems to me the primary aim is to
       produce knowledge that is useful for the health of Americans, build
       research capacity, and support people and institutions that produce
       that produce high quality information. From that perspective,
       capping the number of grants or amount of funding to an individual
       investigator so that other investigators can be funded is very
       short sighted. It is essentially saying we should limit the
       research capacity in the countries most productive labs. Productive
       labs would have to let go their staff and research faculty, which
       also hurts many people, and could cause long-term damage to the
       strongest research groups in the country.
       If we are concerned about ensuring building capacity strategies
       should focus on that. Safeguard the K-award programs. Strengthen
       first-award programs. Put your policies where your aims are.
       The one area where the NIH may want to create some fairness is in
       indirects, capping the highest rates. But there too, we should be
       cautious. Indirects typically do not fully cover the costs of
       research.
       We are in a rough patch. We have been through rough patches before.
       Using the pressure of budgets to execute wise changes in policy and
       funding makes sense. But let's not go overboard. Things will
       improve.

       NIH needs major overhaul.
       i) There should be NO federal salary support for PIs. In fact, it
       should be illegal for receiving institutions to reward PIs for
       receiving federal grants. Instead, advancement should be based
       solely on publications and other public information-generating
       activities. Rewarding PIs for obtaining grants is perverse and
       counterproductive. PIs feeding at the trough just to support
       excessive salaries. Yes, excessive.
       2) In addition to limiting compensation to PIs, there should be
       limits on grant sizes and numbers. There are diminishing returns
       when giving one PI more and more money. You might not want to
       believe it, but the brightest waste money too especially when they
       have too much on their plate.
       3) NIH has had it good... too good, and it's time to reevaluate the
       relative value of medical research. Like our healthcare providers,
       people in medical-related research are excessively compensated (by
       taxpayer money, not private get-what-ever-you-can money). Frankly,
       even if not one more medical advance occurred, we are still going
       to exceed the carrying capacity of the planet in the near future.
       "Saving" mankind is over-rated.

       The subject of this post is critically important and I thank Dr.
       Rockey for visiting the idea. It seems necessary to revisit the
       goals of NIH funding at some point. Absent this exercise, I have
       some practical suggestions.
       My four suggestions below (a-d) is based on the following basic
       ideas:
       1) Investigators in universities should serve a dual role:
       researcher and educator
       2) NIH should not pay for project managers and too much money in
       one researcher's hand simply turns that investigator into a project
       manager
       3) Good biomedical research should get better with time, and in
       some cases become self-sustaining.
       4) NIH should pay for the essentials of research operations, not
       (indirectly) for the several vice presidents and multiple deans
       salaries, and some of the extravagant and half empty buildings.
       Based on these ideas, immediate action by the NIH could stem the
       departure of many young scientists and future faculty to the
       industry.
       a) limit total salary support to less than 50% for all PIs
       b) limit total grant support to less than 500K direct to all PIs
       c) set up a graded scale for research support (1,2,3). Young
       investigators 50%, mid-career investigators 30%, senior
       investigators 20%.
       d) limit indirect costs across the board to all institutions
       I don't suggest that industry is bad. However, a healthy and
       critical mass of educators in universities is needed in order to
       sustain our educational systems. So long as NIH does not focus on
       small research grants for early investigators, and the NIH allows
       universities to use the generic nature of indirect to shift funds
       internally and support numerous administrators, the problem is
       likely to get worse.
       With regards to smaller support and targeted to early
       investigators, I have seen statistics showing a small bump in
       funding younger investigators. However, I venture to guess that
       this bump is an anomaly.
       The main point is that the number of grants should not be the
       operative measure, rather it should be total dollars. Neither
       should the name of the PI under which the grants are funded. What
       should be the operative measure is amount of federal dollars that
       goes in to a PI's lab. For example, here is the statistics I'd like
       to see before I am convinced that the bump for young investigators
       is real: Take all funds for early investigators (no ARRA). Add
       total dollars that is going directly to the PI's lab or a
       commercial company (for research or supplies) - in other words, if
       the money is going to another lab with a senior investigator,
       discount that amount. Now, let's look at the trend lines.

       One final note....universities should not have faculty positions
       (such as my own) that are 100% research based and 100% of my salary
       needs to come from grants. In a time of fiscal responsibility
       faculty positions should be a mix of teaching and research. If you
       get the grants, you can buy yourself out of teaching....if not,
       then you fall back on teaching....and so the cycle ebbs and flows

       I propose a system where your potential funding is linked to your

       into "risk pools" each separated by the negotiated overhead of the
       institution. In this instance, I define "risk as the dollars per
       finding. Obviously, if the grant starts out with a higher dollar
       amount there should be an expectation that the research would yield
       more than a lower dollar project. An application from universities
       with the highest overhead would accordingly have the lowest success
       rate, because they come with the most risk. This would create an
       incentive to bend the cost curve downward, instead of always
       negotiating for higher overhead. In this manner, it would promote
       academic institutes to be better at sharing resources, cutting
       costs and increasing efficiencies (including energy usage). This
       proposal could realistically create 25% more grants, without
       reducing the size of the award to researchers and perhaps even
       accelerate the diffusion of technological training and advancement
       from the coasts to the center of the country where costs are lower.
