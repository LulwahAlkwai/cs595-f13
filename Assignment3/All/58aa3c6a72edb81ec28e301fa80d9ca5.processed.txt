3 Day Startup Work-Along Web Series: Essentials of Crowdfunding

About this Class

   Entrepreneurs, artists, scientists, and other social leaders are more
   connected to their audience and networks than ever before. Modern
   social networking makes reaching out simple and virtually free, while
   the costs of production and distribution have decreased. Meanwhile, the
   old-guard institutions such as record labels and newspapers are
   suffering.

   Now a new movement has hit critical mass, impacting both business and
   creativity.

   Crowdfunding is the foundation of this new creative economy. So what is
   crowdfunding? In a nutshell, it is leveraging networks for funds,
   awareness, and feedback. Crowdfunding is based on the belief that the
   power of many small contributions in aggregate can become significant.
   Successful crowdfunding campaigns combine the emotional power of
   traditional patronage with the massive reach of digital communication.

   Come learn about how crowdfunding works and what you need to
   successfully crowdfund your next project.
