   There really isn't much mystery remaining as [52]Amazon prepares to
   unveil its second-generation [53]Kindle Fire HD tablets and its
   third-generation Kindle Fire slate in the coming weeks. First we
   published [54]exclusive details about Amazon's entire 2013 tablet
   lineup and then we followed up by revealing [55]all of the key specs
   for the upcoming new Kindle Fire HD tablets as well as [56]the new
   entry-level Kindle Fire. Amazon's new high-definition slates are
   shaping up to be two of the most impressive tablets in the world when
   they debut, and anticipation is certainly building. Now, BGR has
   obtained exclusive photos of the unannounced next-generation Kindle
   Fire HD that Amazon is preparing to unveil as soon as later this month,
   giving the world its first-ever look at Amazon's new hardware for 2013.

   We gave an extensive description of the company's new tablets in
   [62]our first exclusive report covering Amazon's tablet plans for 2013,
   but a picture is worth a thousand words. A trusted source has provided
   BGR with several photos that reveal [63]Amazon's next-generation 7-inch
   Kindle Fire HD tablet for the first time ever. And while only the
   7-inch model is pictured in our photo gallery, we have been told that
   the 8.9-inch model is almost identical to the smaller tablet.

   Note that the majority of the back of Amazon's next-generation Kindle
   Fire HD has been obscured in the photos to cover identifiable marks on
   the device.

   As can be seen in our exclusive photos, the 2013 Kindle Fire HD models
   feature an extensive design overhaul. The rounded shape on the back of
   the current models has been replaced with a more angular design that
   gives the device a much harder look. Also as we described, the buttons
   have been completely redesigned since the current layout was a big pain
   point for many users.

   The stereo speakers on the back of the Kindle Fire HD have now been
   moved to the top of the device, as seen in several of our exclusive
   photos. The band across the bottom on the back of the current HD
   tablets has been removed, leaving a smooth back surface interrupted
   only by Amazon's logo.

   BGR-amazon-kindle-fire-2-1

   For a quick refresher, our sources state that Amazon's new 7-inch
   Kindle Fire HD will feature a high-resolution 1,920 x 1,200-pixel
   display, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset clocked at more
   than 2GHz, 2GB of RAM, Wi-Fi, optional cellular data, Android 4.2.2
   Jelly Bean and either 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of internal storage.

   The updated 8.9-inch model is said to feature nearly identical specs
   beneath its 2,560 x 1,600-pixel high-definition display, and it also
   includes an 8-megapixel rear camera.

   We're told both models are lighter and more comfortable to use than the
   current-generation tablets they will replace.

   BGR-amazon-kindle-fire-2-6

   Launch details are still a bit fuzzy but we're told the 7-inch model
   may launch in the coming weeks, while the larger 8.9-inch version might
   not begin shipping until sometime in November. Amazon's 2012 Kindle
   Fire HD launches were staggered as well; the Kindle Fire HD 7'' was
   released in mid-September last year while the Kindle Fire HD 8.9''
   wasn't available until two months later in mid-November.
