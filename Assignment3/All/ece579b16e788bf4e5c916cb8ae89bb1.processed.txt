   Event chain diagram

   Event chain methodology is an uncertainty modeling and schedule
   [15]network analysis technique that is focused on identifying and
   managing events and event chains that affect [16]project schedules.
   Event chain methodology is the next advance beyond [17]critical path
   method and [18]critical chain project management.^[19][1]

   Event chain methodology helps to mitigate the effect of
   [20]motivational and [21]cognitive biases in [22]estimating and
   [23]scheduling.^[24][2]^[25][3]

Event Chain Methodology Principles[26]Edit

Moment of risk and state of activity[27]Edit

   Moment of risk and state of activity

   An activity (task) in most real life processes is not a continuous
   uniform procedure. Tasks are affected by external events, which
   transform an activity from one state to another.

   One of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event
   occurs during the course of an activity. This moment, when an event
   occurs, in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using
   [28]statistical distribution.

Event Chains[29]Edit

   Events can cause other events, which will create event chains. These
   event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. For
   example, requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed. To
   accelerate the activity, the project manager allocates a resource from
   another activity, which then leads to a missed deadline. Eventually,
   this can lead to the failure of the project.

Monte Carlo Simulations[30]Edit

   Once events and event chains are defined, quantitative analysis using
   [31]Monte Carlo simulation can be performed to quantify the cumulative
   effect of the events. Probabilities and effects of risks are used as
   input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the project schedule.^[32][4]
   In most real life projects, it is necessary to supplement the
   information regarding the uncertainties expressed as an event, with
   distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other
   parameters.

Critical Event Chains[33]Edit

   The single events or the event chains that have the most potential to
   affect the projects are the "critical events" or "critical chains of
   events." By identifying critical events or critical chains of events,
   we can mitigate their negative effects. These critical chains of events
   can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main
   project parameters, such as project duration or cost, and the event
   chains.

Performance Tracking with Event Chains[34]Edit

   Monitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is
   used to perform the analysis. During the course of the project, the
   probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual
   data. The main issue with performance tracking is forecasting an
   activity's duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and
   certain events are assigned to the activity. The simple heuristic
   approach to this problem is to analyze the moment of risk, which is
   defined as one of the event parameters. Advanced analysis can be
   performed using a Bayesian approach.

Event Chain Diagrams[35]Edit

   Event Chain Diagrams are visualizations that show the relationships
   between events and tasks and how the events affect each other. The
   simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows
   associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart.
   Different events and event chains can be displayed using different
   colors. Events can be global (for all tasks in the project) and local
   (for a particular task). By using Event Chain Diagrams to visualize
   events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and
   uncertainties can be significantly simplified.

Event Chain Methodology Phenomena[36]Edit

Repeated Activities[37]Edit

   Repeated Acitivity

   Sometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already
   been completed. This is a very common scenario for real life projects;
   sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of
   a succeeding activity. Modeling of these scenarios using event chain
   methodology is simple. The original project schedule does not need to
   be updated, as all that is required is to define the event and assign
   it to an activity that points to the previous activity. In addition, a
   limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated needs to be
   defined.

Event Chains and Risk Mitigation[38]Edit

   Mitigation plan

   If event or event chain occurs during the course of a project, it may
   require some mitigation effort. In some cases, mitigation plans can be
   generated. Mitigation plans are an activity or group of activities
   (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event
   occurs. The solution is to assign the mitigation plan to an event or
   event chain. These small schedules will be triggered when an event
   chain occurs. The same mitigation plan can be used for different
   events.

Resource Allocation Based on Events[39]Edit

   One potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity
   to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if
   an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed
   period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from
   another activity. Reallocation of resources can also occur when
   activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a
   certain value. Events can be used to model different situations with
   resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.
