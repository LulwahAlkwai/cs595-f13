[167]You Are What You Tweet: Tracking Public Health Trends from Twitter
Messages

July 6, 2011
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MEDIA CONTACT: Phil Sneiderman

prs@jhu.edu
       Twitter allows millions of social media fans to comment in 140
       characters or less on just about anything: an actor's outlandish
       behavior, an earthquake's tragic toll or the great taste of a
       grilled cheese sandwich.
       But by sifting through this busy flood of banter, is it possible to
       also track important public health trends? Two Johns Hopkins
       University computer scientists would respond with a one-word tweet:
       "Yes!"
       Mark Dredze and Michael J. Paul fed 2 billion public tweets posted
       between May 2009 and October 2010 into computers, then used
       software to filter out the 1.5 million messages that referred to
       health matters. Identities of the tweeters were not collected by
       Dredze, a researcher at the university's [169]Human Language
       Technology Center of Excellence and an assistant research professor
       of [170]computer science, and Paul, a doctoral student.
       "Our goal was to find out whether Twitter posts could be a useful
       source of public health information, " Dredze said. "We determined
       that indeed, they could. In some cases, we probably learned some
       things that even the tweeters' doctors were not aware of, like
       which over-the-counter medicines the posters were using to treat
       their symptoms at home."

       By sorting these health-related tweets into electronic "piles,"
       Dredze and Paul uncovered intriguing patterns about allergies, flu
       cases, insomnia, cancer, obesity, depression, pain and other
       ailments. "There have been some narrow studies using Twitter posts,
       for example, to track the flu," Dredze said. "But to our knowledge,
       no one has ever used tweets to look at as many health issues as we
       did."
       Dredze and Paul, who also are affiliated with the university's
       [171]Center for Language and Speech Processing, have discussed some
       of their results in recent months at computer science conferences.
       They will present their complete study on July 18 in Barcelona,
       Spain, at the International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media,
       sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial
       Intelligence.
       In addition to finding a range of health ailments in Twitter posts,
       the researchers were able to record many of the medications that
       ill tweeters consumed, thanks to posts such as: "Had to pop a
       Benadryl...allergies are the worst."
       Other tweets pointed to misuse of medicine. "We found that some
       people tweeted that they were taking antibiotics for the flu," Paul
       said. "But antibiotics don't work on the flu, which is a virus, and
       this practice could contribute to the growing antibiotic resistance
       problems. So these tweets showed us that some serious medical
       misperceptions exist out there."
       Of course, the vast majority of daily tweets have nothing to do
       with an illness. While a simple approach would be to filter for
       words that are tied to illness, such as "headache" or "fever," this
       strategy fails on such tweets as "High price of gas is a headache
       for my business" or "Got a case of Bieber Fever. Love his new
       song." To find the health-related posts among the billions of
       messages in their original pool, the Johns Hopkins researchers
       applied a filtering and categorization system they devised. With
       this tool, computers can be taught to disregard phrases that do not
       really relate to one's health, even though they contain a word
       commonly used in a health context.

       Once the unrelated tweets were removed, the remaining results
       provided some surprising findings. "When we started, I didn't even
       know if people talked about allergies on Twitter," Paul said. "But
       we found out that they do. And there was one thing I didn't expect:
       The system found two different types of allergies - the type that
       causes sniffling and sneezing and the kind that causes skin rashes
       and hives."
       In about 200,000 of the health-related tweets, the researchers were
       able to draw on user-provided public information to identify the
       geographic state from which the message was sent. That allowed them
       to track some trends by time and place, such as when the allergy
       and flu seasons peaked in various parts of the country. "We were
       able to see from the tweets that the allergy season started earlier
       in the warmer states and later in the Midwest and the Northeast,"
       Dredze said.
       Dredze and Paul have already begun talking to public health
       scientists, including some affiliated with Johns Hopkins, who say
       that future studies of tweets could uncover even more useful data,
       not only about posters' medical problems but also about public
       perceptions concerning illnesses, medications and other health
       issues.

       Still, Dredze and Paul cautioned that trying to take the nation's
       temperature by analyzing tweets has its limitations. For one thing,
       most Twitter users did not comment more than once on their
       particular ailment, making it tough to track how long the illness
       lasted and whether it recurred. In addition, most Twitter users
       tend to be young, which would exclude many senior citizens from a
       public health study. Also, at the moment, Twitter is dominated by
       users who are in the United States, making it less useful for
       research in other countries.
       Although social media sites allow users to expose lots of personal
       information to friends and strangers, Twitter-based research may
       only reach a certain depth. "In our study," Paul said, "we could
       only learn what people were willing to share. We think there's a
       limit to what people are willing to share on Twitter."
       Nevertheless, Dredze says there is still plenty of useful data left
       to plumb from Twitter posts. "The people I've talked to have felt
       this is a really interesting research tool," he said, "and they
       have some great ideas about what they'd like to learn next from
       Twitter."
