[4]We need to get a lot better at imagining the future

   We live in an era of fast changes. Ten years ago, YouTube was
   unthinkable, social media did not exist (Facebook was founded in 2004),
   we got our movies on tapes at video stores, cell phones did not have
   cameras, and so on.

   If you are reasonable, you have to expect ever greater changes in the
   next ten years. Maybe you think you are open-minded and can think
   clearly about the future. Then close your eyes and imagine a world...
     * ... where the PC and Windows are all but a memory...
     * ... where driving a car yourself is considered reckless...
     * ... where paper books are like vinyl records...
     * ... where the last TV station closed down years ago...
     * ... where the notion of putting kids in a classroom to learn at
       fixed hours is considered barbaric...
     * ... where working more than 10 hours a week for money is considered
       strange...
     * ... where corporations have been declared obsolete...

   Can you imagine a world where these things are true? I bet you cannot.

   Scifi novels become obsolete very fast because scifi writers have
   failures of imagination. For example, most novels written before 1990
   missed the Web. (It is very annoying to read a novel about year 2150
   where the Web has not been invented yet.) If scifi writers fail to
   imagine our future, regular workers are bound to think that whatever
   they do now will still be needed in 10 or 20 years. And their reaction
   is entirely predictable: point out the obvious limitations of whatever
   new technology could threaten their livelihood.
     * When blogs first took hold, journalisms almost unanimously
       ridiculed them. Many journalists never could adapt, and many more
       lost their great working conditions. You can still sell good
       pictures to your local newspapers, but who is going to pay $5000
       when any kid can snap a picture on his cell phone and broadcast it
       on Twitter within seconds? Of course, the quality is not the same.
       Of course, average bloggers can't replace true journalists.
     * Teachers are quick to point out the limitations of cheap online
       learning. I sometimes like to brag that I took a class with the
       [5]greatest geometer of the 20th century. Taking an online course
       with him would not have been the same. Watching him tear apart a
       student who asked about applications was frightening. You just
       can't simulate this on YouTube.

   Arguing with people who refuse to see their own doom can be fun, but
   tiring. They often simply cannot see it. Thankfully, [6]Simon Law
   pointed out an effective way to fight this cognitive bias. To know
   whether you will endure, look in the past, not in the future. Ask who
   you replaced before denying that someone could replace you.
     * Newspapers replaced [7]news ballads. That is right: whenever some
       important event needed to be disseminated, people wrote a song
       about it. Far more artistic and entertaining than the average news
       report on CNN. It took real talent to write compelling ballads. I
       am sure that when the first newspapers came along, whoever wrote
       news ballads was unimpressed.
     * Almost all teachers today work in an industrial setting, with
       students organized in classes, with standard testing. If you go
       back to the pre-Gutenberg era, teachers were scholars paid by the
       students for actual tutoring. Socrate would have been horrified by
       how philosophy is taught today. Certainly, he would not have
       approved of the way we sit the students in a classroom and give a
       grade to each student for each topic.

   Maybe the greatest challenge we face as a species is that we need to
   get a lot better at imagining the future. Some people have wondered,
   for example, why I have been so critical of our response to global
   warming. But look at how people too often react: the Earth is warming,
   so let us create new taxes.

   How original! Can you imagine the admiral James T. Kirk: "Spock, what
   shall we do, the Earth is warming!"... Spock: "Surely, we should try
   carbon taxes. Let us not do anything crazy involving computers or any
   technology beyond tax collection... that would be illogical..."

   Given any problem today, if you suggest that we out-innovate it with
   technology, you are perceived as a dangerous man who think that we are
   bound by history to [8]push forward toward an undiscovered country.
   Crazy talk!

   People are concerned that technology is allowing the very best to get
   richer than was ever possible before. So, everyone, from politicians to
   union leader, is stuck on the idea that we must, somehow, create more
   jobs. Maybe we need to grant more university degrees. Maybe we need
   more PhDs. Maybe we need more government workers. Maybe we need more
   subsidies. Because, you know, 40-hour jobs is what we had so it must be
   what we will have. But nobody, it seems, can conceive a world where
   most of us work far less for money than we do now. Nobody can imagine a
   world where millions of people post design and publish [9]cool videos
   of their dog to pass time while we keep on finding clever ways to rise
   our standard of living. Somehow, that's unthinkable. We must find a way
   to keep people busy at a desk 40 hours a week. No matter what the cost.

   I am seriously thinking about writing a scifi novel about people unable
   to imagine the future.

   Kirk: "What shall we do, these transporters will make the the shuttle
   pilots nearly obsolete..." Bones: "Do not worry, we are preparing a
   medical advisory against this new dangerous technology." Lady in the
   back: "Sirs? Can you please shut down your tricorders, they are
   forbidden on Star Ships along with any other portable electronics..."

    1. Can't we combine the best of past and future? I think we're all
       agreed that news ballads on YouTube would be a fantastic
       replacement for journalism!

    2. Daniel -- I hope you find a chance to sit down with "Limits to
       Growth, the 30 year update" by Meadows. It's exactly the kind of
       book more people need to read to think more clearly about the
       future. (I also expect you'll disagree with the book, at least at
       first, but that's exactly why you should read it.)

    3. Actually, small monetary punishments (taxes, fines) are the most
       effective way a government has to influence common policy in a
       society. Or at least that was the conclusion of a historical
       effectiveness study by the Dutch.

    4. "When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something
       is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that
       something is impossible, he is very probably wrong."

    5. Most of the examples you give are positive or neutral. But there
       could be negative changes as well. Who would have predicted 15
       years ago that you'd have to subject yourself to a humiliating
       ritual to board an airplane?
       Maybe we'll look back fondly on the times when you could blog
       without a license. It is technically difficult to censor the web,
       but I could imagine having to comply with some burdensome though
       ineffective legislation for blogging just as for flying.

    7. I love science fiction and I read a lot of it. I believe that
       science fiction is, in a fundamental way, never about the future;
       it is always a way of seeing the present. We can try, but we can
       never truly escape the present. However, the harder science fiction
       tries to escape the present, the more light it sheds on the
       present. This belief might seem strange, but if you read the
       classics of science fiction, you will see what I mean. The classics
       are not obsolete; they give you great insights into the time in
       which they were written.

    8. "Then close your eyes and imagine a world...
       1 where the PC and Windows are all but a memory...
       2 where driving a car yourself is considered reckless...
       3 where paper books are like vinyl records...
       4 where the last TV station closed down years ago...
       5 where the notion of putting kids in a classroom to learn at fixed
       hours is considered barbaric...
       6 where working more than 10 hours a week for money is considered
       strange...
       7 where corporations have been declared obsolete...
       Can you imagine a world where these things are true? I bet you
       cannot."
       1. I don't understand that. You mean that pc/windows won't work to
       speed up(for example: better cpu) and only making `more' memory,
       like hard disk?
       2. Nowadays there is lot of `pc' in the cars. So it's quite easy to
       imagine it for young people.
       While person is interested in robots he/she see it even more.
       3. Well, considering current prices of books & e-books it wont
       change that fast. Let say that e-book cost 85% or normal book. I
       think some of people want `physical' form(paper). So if person must
       pay `almost' the same price for something that he/she cannot hold
       in hand I think he will choice book.
       Book can have decorative meaning(bookshelves looks nice). Virtual
       bookshelves such as [24]http://www.goodreads.com is not so `fun'.
       4. I don't watch tv. Only movies on the internet. So it's easy to
       imagine this.
       5. It's quite easy to imagine. I took some courses on the internet.
       Some of them were good and some of them not so good but it is nice
       to take courses from range variety of subject and people. It wont
       be possible without internet. This `field' of education has to be
       improved but it is in good way.
       6. More work = more money. Considering that there is more people on
       the world there would be less work to do per one person. Unless you
       think about some of fancy way such as: eating 3 pills per day I
       don't think there is way of working at most 10 hours and having
       time to `send movie of your dog'.
       7. There can be one corporation that govern everything.
       So, to sum up:
       Some of them are easy to imagine but other are not that much
       imaginable - 6th is the hardest. Would you mind to describe what
       you can imagine about that topic?

    9. Everything but the last two are obvious. And the last two have been
       promised (and predicted) for decades, but will not materialize
       because of greed and human nature - which is not subject to
       technological advancement.
       Even the classroom one is much harder to shift than any
       technological advancement. We are more likely to put computers in
       clasrooms (maintaining the existing teaching methods) than we are
       to dispense with them altogether.
       Ironically, we have governemts here in Canada in the last 10 years
       that have increased the workweek, and there was widespread outcry
       from business at the addition of one new holiday (family day in
       Ontario).
       In short, devices will continue to amaze, surprise and advance.
       Behaviour will remain firmly rooted in our collective past.

   10. "where driving a car yourself is considered reckless"
       "where paper books are like vinyl records"
       I find these obvious.
       "where the last TV station closed down years ago"
       I thought about it. If it's about the way a TV studio broadcasts
       it's content, then yes - I foresee future TV stations as Internet
       Video Streaming services. If it's about studios streaming media for
       consumers, then I am not overly confident that it will change,
       because the audience's preference. I can't be hoping that people
       will somehow change their habits and give up the comfort of being
       fed with information while vegetating.
       "where the notion of putting kids in a classroom to learn at fixed
       hours is considered barbaric"
       I would like to be able to discern something better. Although we
       tend to use technology, our dependence from other humans diminishes
       only gradually. Being kids we still need parents, we still need
       other people's guidance. The world is a very confusing place when
       you're young and unacquainted with it, and we need other human
       tutors to guide us through, at least for a while. This human
       interaction (not including the entire learning and self-development
       process) is what I consider to be the bare-bone of non-automatable
       or tech-nonreplaceable human activity, at least in our current
       understanding of "human". Now considering the fact that human work
       is not a resource to be wasted, putting for that purpose more
       children under the guidance of the same qualified person, in the
       same limited amount of time is only practical. If I didn't
       correctly got the nuance of the term "barbaric" or what you meant
       by it, my apology.
       There is, on a second line, another argument put in words by Paul
       Graham (search for "Powerful Thoughts From Paul Graham" by Ross
       Hudgens, the 10th enumerated thought), about the school being an
       institution that takes responsibility for kids for a few hours of
       daytime setting their parents free. This might be considered
       somehow "barbaric", but isn't something that I see changed in the
       near future. After all, school kids are minors that require care
       and as pleasant parenting might be, from time to time we might also
       need our time for something else.
       "where working more than 10 hours a week for money is considered
       strange"
       People don't work as much as they do because they have to, but
       because they can. I don't see people trying to get more free time
       for the sake of getting more non-working time, I see instead people
       pushing themselves trying to accomplish more. If you manage to
       limit your involvement in something, you get yourself a free
       resource on your hands and be tempted to invest it in something
       else. I believe that it's possible for us adjust our definition of
       "work", like including reading or other maintenance activities
       related to work itself in the "working hours" term, but I consider
       my time a too valuable resource to waste. If I can work more than
       two hours per day and I enjoy it, why not?

       altogether.
       It is easier to imagine, yes. Obviously, if we staunchly refuse to
       imagine a different future, we may be stuck with whatever we have
       now. That is what I am denouncing.
       Comment by [29]Daniel Lemire -- 2/4/2013 @ [30]13:01
   12. I get that you are denouncing the status quo. I am actually in full
       agreement that it needs to change. I just believe as a futurist
       that we have far less chance of changing a sociological phenomona
       than a technical one.
       Therefore, my prediction is that we will have rows of bored kids in
       classrooms listening (not) to teacher for decades to come - with or
       without a screen per desk, and we will still work 40 hour weeks
       augmented with 10 or more additional hours of unpaid work which we
       do in order to keep our jobs that have failed to keep pace with
       costs of living (including house prices).
       It is not a lack of imagination by futurists that holds us back. It
       is a lack of motivation by people with a vested interest in the
       status quo, and the lack of a fulcrum for people interested in
       moving the future into the present.

       We work fewer hours for pay with every year that passes. Just look
       at the OECD numbers:
       [38]http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=ANHRS Maybe you
       are working more and more, but we aren't. Not as a people.
       Comment by [39]Daniel Lemire -- 2/4/2013 @ [40]15:10
   16. You chart says that the average worker has reduced his annual work
       week by 70 hours - and there are several issues that can be made
       with this statistic.
       - this is a nationally collected statistic, meaning that it may be
       skewed based on the reportage of a few (mostly union) workplaces.
       - That it may reflect overall on an aging workforce that is
       collectively becoming entitled to more holidays and so does not
       reflect, for example, what an entry level worker works (which
       probably accounts for the entire reduction you speak of).
       - That this is the total, and does not directly account for the
       weekly hours but rather incorporates sick leave, vacations and
       other leave.
       - There are growing numbers of people working few (very few) hours
       - often either not by choice, or by age (semi-retired).
       - There are insufficient data points to really get a long term
       trend (to simply extrapolate that data, we would indeed be working
       10 hours a week within 15 years. However, if we took similar data
       from the 1960s, we would have been working 10 hours by 1990).

   17. @Dominic Amann
       All true, but if we had longer term data, I am confident that it
       would show the same consistent trend: we work fewer hours on
       average. It is a robust trend over decades and over all countries.
       Obviously, it says nothing about the future nor about your personal
       case.
       Comment by [43]Daniel Lemire -- 2/4/2013 @ [44]20:02
   18. The world changes faster than people expect, but the changes often
       come from things some people have already been doing for a long
       time. For example, people had been using social media for decades
       when it became mainstream 5-10 years ago. Usenet was social media.
       BBSes were social media. IRC was (and is) social media. When I
       started using Facebook, it immediately felt familiar, as I had
       grown up using similar services.
       Regarding your predictions:
       1. My desktop system consists of a display, a keyboard and a mouse.
       The PC is still there, integrated into the display, but it has
       become an uninteresting part of the system. In my pocket, I have a
       touchscreen with another integrated PC. My laptop still looks
       pretty much the same as my first laptop 15 years ago, but otherwise
       the interfaces have become more interesting than the computers
       themselves.
       3. In Finland, an extensive bookshelf was long considered an
       essential part of an educated household. Yet already in the late
       90s, young people started abandoning this habit, hiding their books
       in closets instead of displaying them prominently.
       4. Due to bandwidth issues, TV stations will continue having an
       advantage in broadcasting major live events such as Formula 1,
       Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup for the next 10 to 15 years.
       Last year, YouTube could barely broadcast the Baumgartner jump in
       low quality to 8 million simultaneous viewers, and the audiences of
       these events can be a hundred times larger. Yet apart from live
       coverage, TV stations may start dying off sooner than expected.
       5. The main reason for fixed class hours in primary education is to
       keep the kids off the street while their parents are at work.
       (Finland actually increased the number of funded PhD positions for
       similar reasons during the deep recession of early 90s.) If
       non-standard working hours become more common, primary education
       will accommodate.
       6. It seems that the gap between highly productive people and less
       productive people is getting wider and wider. A large part of the
       decreasing trend in the average working hours is due to the
       difficulties the less productive people have in finding full-time
       jobs. Simultaneously, especially in the US, moderately productive
       people have to work harder and harder to maintain their social
       status and the middle class standard of living. On the other hand,
       especially in Europe, the statistics underestimate the true
       decrease in working hours, as people are saving their free time
       into retirement. After all, lifespans have been increasing much
       faster than the retirement age for decades.
       Comment by [45]Jouni -- 2/4/2013 @ [46]20:10
   19. I just remember reading the same things you are saying about
       working hours in the 70s, and here I am in the 20-teens, still
       working the hours that my dad worked, and seeing house prices (as a
       percentage of income) dramatically higher.
       Only union, tenured or guild member workers get to work any less,
       and only by a small margin.
       The vast proportion of work-week reduction comes simply from the
       growing number of part time jobs. You will note that your OECD
       stats only address the "primary" occupation of people. Many of
       these have 2 or more jobs to make ends meet.
       Your notion of shorter work week runs counter to the plateaux we
       are seeing in real productivity. Growth may not be a truly
       sustainable phenomena. If it is true, that growth will not continue
       at its past pace, and productivity stagnates, then we will not see
       any further reductions in work week. We may see increases, as
       governments and corporations see it as the only way to increase
       productivity.

   21. @Dominic Amann
       We constructed the Web, collectively... something that nobody could
       imagine in the 1980s... Yes, yes, there were networks back then,
       but we could not imagine that we would have what we have now. Many
       scifi authors imagined a future without the Web... and those that
       did imagine something like the Web, imagined it as something very
       advanced that we would not see before a very long time.
       The fact that you can't imagine a reduction of the number of
       working hours does not mean that it won't happen or that it can't
       happen. I say it is a failure of imagination. (I don't blame you
       though.)
       There is strong evidence that it has been happening ... of course,
       the decrease is tiny if you just consider active workers... but you
       do realize that someone born in 1970 will have had twice as much
       leisure time than someone born in 1870? (Just think that many
       people get 10 years of retirement time that people did not get in
       the past...)
       Our inability to imagine a different future is a cognitive bias,
       not a good thing.

   22. I can certainly IMAGINE a shorter work week. I have been imagining
       one for 40 years. It hasn't happened for me or for anyone I know
       who is in full time work. That leads me to question why - not as a
       failure of imagination, but as a failure of assumptions in the
       model we are using to predict.
       Your assumption that imagination is the cause of failure is not
       born out by the facts. We failed to imagine how small and powerful
       technology would be - but it happened anyway. We predicted a 10
       hour work week before now, but that has failed to materialize. That
       would suggest to me that imagination is not the limiting or even
       guiding factor here.

       About working hours... Most research-bound professors, for example,
       work well over 45 hours a week. (Actually, 45 hours a week is the
       average for all professors, including those who don't do research.)
       Whenever I tell another professor (one that is active in research)
       that I don't work week-ends, I get a long pause... people can't
       imagine not working week-ends. At least in computer science.
       I chose, many years ago, to work few hours. At the time, I did not
       have tenure. I have written a series of blog posts about it. Where
       do you think I find the time for this blog?
       And I found a way to make it work. I work much less than 40 hours a
       week. Never more than 35 hours... (I reported this elsewhere on my
       blog.) If you ask around about my output, people will tell you
       something in the range of good to very good. I'm obviously not a
       star... I couldn't be... but I managed to combine a good to very
       good output with far fewer hours than my colleagues...
       And, no, pulling it off was not easy. It was a quest...
       Obviously, my own personal case does not extend at large... But I
       reject the idea that we won't achieve it.

   24. I too can have a shorter work week - down to 40 hours + 3.5 hours
       lunch (dickensian company). I could get better by switching
       company.
       As you say, that will not help anyone else out there.
       The official, government mandated work week has not shortened since
       the 60s in much of the civilized world.
       I don't reject the idea that we won't achieve it. I acknowledge
       that we won't achieve it without some as yet unanticipated upheaval
       occuring. Either we start consuming a whole lot less, or we
       increase our productivity significantly. Expecting some other path
       to shorten work hours is to ignore economics.

   25. I agree with your broader thesis - most people are bad at imagining
       the future. However, your point about taxes implies that technology
       will magically happen without it being incentivized in some way.
       New technologies are developed and have impact in two circumstances
       - either they appear to generate profit, or they require negligible
       resources to create and utilize.
       So if we want to encourage new energy tech, either we can make it
       free to develop new energy technologies...or we make it more
       expensive to use old tech. Subsidies/grants do the former, taxes do
       the latter.
       Incentives drive action - including the actions which will
       determine what technology is developed, and what our future will be
       like.
       Perhaps Spock really would have said: "Surely, we should try carbon
       taxes. This would encourage investment in methods for solving our
       problem using crazy things like computers and other technology ...
       this *is* clearly the logical solution..."

       "..the notion of putting kids in a classroom to learn at fixed
       hours is considered barbaric.."
       I like this, it is striking. I humbly think educator like yourself
       should promote this further.

   28. Another neo-con canard - that cash incentives encourage innovation.
       Innovation may be capitalized upon - after the fact. However,
       pretty much all the innovations of this and any other era have
       occurred in circumstances where you would be very hard pressed to
       see any direct financial advantage for the inventor - sometimes
       even long after the invention has been capitalized upon. If one
       were seeking financial advantage, it would generally speaking
       always be more efficient to spend ones energies wating for a likely
       invention by someone (else) and buying that idea for as little as
       one can and profiting from it by leverage one's capital advantage.
       I have not seen any genuine study of t5he true catalysts - or
       mechanisms for the "process of" invention. There may be such
       studies, but if there are, it would appear that they are ignored in
       favour of the "common sense" notion that money drives creativity.
       It would seem (to my untutored eye) that recognition is a bigger
       motivator for human achievement than money.

       Just rewatch Star Trek episodes, say Star Trek DS9 (made during the
       nineties). It is supposedly set in the 24th century, but they lack
       many of the things we take for granted today. E.g., when an
       engineer spots a problem, he can't just film it and send it over,
       he has to call another engineer to ask him to come over. Their
       information retrieval technology is slightly ahead of us in some
       ways, but backward in others. If you watch older Star Trek episodes
       (designed in the 1980s), it is just terrible: they have nothing
       close to an iPhone or the web!
       It is true that web was present in older work, say Ender's game...
       but it was presented as something highly sophisticated (e.g.,
       posting anonymously on it was a feat)... Scifi authors in general
       failed to imagine the web... that is, a worldwide network that even
       the poorest people can have access to.
       Comment by [66]Daniel Lemire -- 8/4/2013 @ [67]9:11
   30. +Daniel Lemire - regarding the fact that no-one imagined the web
       "the way we use it today" - as in mostly anonymous, with largest
       use case being cats and breasts - I agree. However, I believe it
       proves my point, that is to say - we can (with some success)
       foresee the technical advancements (massive networking, small
       powerful computers), but we always stumble over the people
       component. This is what is hard - predicting people. Asimov was on
       to something when he invented psychohistory.
       Comment by [68]Dominic Amann -- 8/4/2013 @ [69]10:03
   31. @Dominic, I'd also love to see hard evidence about invention -
       however, my assumptions are not based off of any "neocon world
       view."
       I just happen to spend a lot of time with people who do research,
       make things, and build companies. I agree that the best of these
       people are /not/ driven by money as you say. However - they often
       need outside money to succeed with their bigger, more impactful
       projects. And they only get that money if there is a financial
       reward for their backers.
       It's a lot harder to get funding when building a business around
       energy efficient devices when energy costs are cheap...not to
       mention the funding for an insanely large project like the design
       and production of an electric car!
       I can guarantee you that Elon Musk would sell far more cars (and
       could have gotten investment at better rates) if energy prices in
       the US where closer to those of Europe. There *are* studies of
       supply and demand cost curves!
       Comment by Mostly Agree -- 8/4/2013 @ [70]12:57
   32. @Mostly Agree
       Isn't Elon Musk's car company American?
       By your logic, shouldn't we see more innovation regarding electric
       cars in Europe?
       Comment by [71]Daniel Lemire -- 8/4/2013 @ [72]13:37
   33. +Daniel About Elon Musk - it is two-part. Firstly Elon is primarily
       an investor and front man - he employs great technical people who
       probably do most of the scientific heavy lifting.
       Secondly, although Europe has higher fuel prices, it is also less
       inclined to move innovation to the next level - European investors
       seem to be more risk averse than their American counterparts. I see
       numerous examples of great European innovation, but far fewer
       extremely succesful companies grow out of that. The dawn of the PC
       era - Cambridge (Sinclair) computing springs to mind - although an
       offshhot of that is the ARM CPU - it does not make one corporation
       very rich.
       Once again, the determining factor would seem to be human nature
       rather than some measurable reward or predictable advance in
       technology.
       Comment by [73]Dominic Amann -- 8/4/2013 @ [74]14:19
   34. @Dominic Amann
       Right, but shouldn't we assess policies based on results?
       If high taxes lead to lots of industrial innovation, then surely,
       Europe ought to be very innovative.
       In the case of gas, there is a very simple reason why high taxes
       can't work. If you are sitting on a reserve of oil, the question
       for you is not whether you will exploit it, but rather when. If
       taxes start rising, this gives you an incentive to exploit it
       sooner rather than later... that is, you should ramp up production
       now... thus lowering prices and increasing consumption... the
       opposite of what we'd like to have.
       Basically, I just don't see high taxes as a simple (or particularly
       clever) way to solve our climate problems.
       They are very convenient however for people would rather have high
       taxes in any case.
       Comment by [75]Daniel Lemire -- 8/4/2013 @ [76]14:38
   35. +Daniel
       Again, you are starting from assumptions about human nature. Recent
       research has shown (using a reward based variation of the
       prisoners' dilemna) that different cultures react and behave
       differently to the same set of stimuli/rewards. We imagine that
       everybody is "just like us under the skin", but that is not so.
       Just because some people respond in a predictable (to you) way to
       incentives or disincentives, does not mean that all people of all
       cultures actually work that way.
       I am not quite understanding your last comment. Do you mean when
       /prices/ (not taxes) start rising? Increasing taxes (in Europe)
       have been proven to reduce demand - which is the effect they wanted
       to see. That is why people drive much more economical cars than
       they used to, and much more economical than the US. In fact, the
       cars in Europe are so economical that it is very hard to compete
       with hybrid or electric technology since the initial cost is so
       high, and the margin of improvement is much smaller than it is
       here. It is hard to make a car more efficient than 60-70 MPG, which
       is readily obtainable in the UK in a practical gasoline or disel
       car.
       One of the reasons Tesla does better here is because he (wisely)
       chose to build luxury cars, where a larger part of the margin is
       luxury, and the cost of the drive train can be buried in a much
       larger pile of money. Then there are more rich (and vain) people
       (here) who will buy his car. The environment statement is an added
       status symbol here (like every A list actor has a Prius).
       In other words, it is again much more about human nature than
       strict cost/benefit analysis.

       Increasing taxes (in Europe) have been proven to reduce demand -
       which is the effect they wanted to see.
       You are Saudi Arabia and you have some oil reserves. Europe
       increases its taxes. What do you do?
       Do you think for a minute that Saudi Arabia is going to decide that
       some of its oil reserve will, from now on, remain unexploited
       because of European taxes?
       As far as global warming is concerned, only one thing does matter:
       how much of the oil is left in the ground. Even if Europe decided
       to stop importing oil, and it is importing oil from Russia as fast
       as Russia can pump it right now... it would still not matter...
       someone else would buy the now cheaper oil... and it would
       immediately send a signal to all the oil producers that they have
       to hurry and sell their oil as fast as possible.
       Energy efficiency... that's nice... but if you have more efficient
       cars, what happens? It curbs demand at first... but what does that
       do? It lower prices! Lower prices mean more demand!
       Did Europe really lower its oil consumption since 1990? Oh! Sure!
       The demand has fallen around 2008, but we know why that is!
       My larger point is that if all you have to fix big problems are
       larger taxes, you are in trouble.
       Comment by [79]Daniel Lemire -- 8/4/2013 @ [80]15:37
   37. In an overall measure, Western Europe uses less fossil fuel energy
       per person than people in the US and Canada. I am not sure exactly
       what the numbers are when normalized against climate etc, but I am
       pretty sure that they use less fossil fuel per person than here.
       The taxes cause a marked differential behaviour. That behaviour is
       directly observable in both car buying choices and driving
       behaviour.
       It is also observable in other buying choices, as well as the
       reduction of fuel use in many other areas (using less pesticides
       and herbicides - fossil fuel derived).
       In what way do you find that these higher taxes are not working (in
       those countries that apply them)? It is the observation of most
       people that these practices do in fact work. Are you supposing some
       kind of conspiracy making up results? I have been to the UK (I was
       born there) and seen first hand the small cars and frugal driving
       habits, as well as the great care with home heating and lighting
       efficiency.

       Obviously, given two continents, one with high taxes on oil, and
       one with low taxes on oil, the one with high taxes will tend to
       consume less.
       When you curb European demand, you reduce the price of oil which
       then entices other continents to consume more of it.
       You still have to show that the relatively modest per capita UK
       consumption is making Saudi Arabia renounce to some of their
       accessible oil reserves.
       Comment by [83]Daniel Lemire -- 8/4/2013 @ [84]16:40
   39. +Daniel - I am not trying to show a reduced /world/ consumption of
       oil. That cannot happen unless the world also agrees to a carbon
       cap-and-trade system. I am showing that taxes are an effective way
       of modifying consumer behavious (within limits).
       I suspect we are passing a tipping point in green energy anyway.
       Grid costs (and aging infrastructure costs) are making alternative
       energy so attractive even in the US that big generation companies
       are offering micro-generation capacity to households on a
       "zero-down" plan. The fact that many jurisdictions offer tax
       incentives to the initial capital outlay is another effective
       incentive that reduces carbon footprint.
