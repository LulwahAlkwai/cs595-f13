Confidentiality

   Learning as a group increases when there is the ability to share. At
   the same time, because open workshops involve individuals from multiple
   organizations, confidentiality also needs to be respected. The
   workshops operate under the Chatham House Rule with the aim of
   providing anonymity to speakers and to encourage openness and the
   sharing of information. The Rule states: "When a meeting, or part
   thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to
   use the information received, but neither the identity nor the
   affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may
   be revealed."Therefore, participants are asked to think through in
   advance what aspects of their business strategy and tactics they are
   willing and able to share, keeping in mind that there may or may not be
   competitors in the room. In addition, the workshops will be a social
   media free zone. Participants are free to indicate via social channels
   that they are participating, but are not permitted to share workshop
   discussions.
