What we are doing

   We are building a next-generation version of the landmark
   [17]California Water Atlas
     * Improving open data
     * Building community & sharing methods
     * Creating high-end, legible visualizations
     * Sharing open source code
     * Adopting radically inclusive & equitable ways of working
     * Building a public work for Californians
     * Incorporating science and encouraging accuracy
     * Seeking peer-reviews
     * Including historical data
     * Healing damages of the past, non-violent communications
     * Working for the future

   California Water Atlas book

The original California Water Atlas

   The California Water Atlas, a book published in 1979, continues to
   inspire map-makers and water lovers alike. We are making a new version
   of this Atlas for our generation as a public work for Californians
   using dynamic maps, open data and lots of citizen involvement.

Why this project matters

     "The New California Water Atlas could catalyze a shift in California
     water policy and governance that will make California water policy
     capable of supporting the state's natural resources, human
     population and agricultural sector in perpetuity. That's why we're
     funding it."
     Huey Johnson, President Resource Renewal Institute, former Secretary
     of Resource for the State of California (1978-1982), Advisory Group
     for the original California Water Atlas

     "The NCWA is filling an essential need by making it easier for
     Californians to understand who uses how much water where. That's not
     happening now, and we see the results in lawsuits, collapsing
     ecosystems, and overspending on attempts to compensate for
     mismanagement. Support the NCWA and support our future."
     David Zetland, Project Advisor

     "How do we re-prioritize a water system designed by previous
     generations to meet the unique challenges of our time? The New
     California Water Atlas is the much needed conduit between government
     and citizens to aid in facilitating dialogue, transparency, and data
     sharing about future social, environmental, and economic priorities
     for our water in California."
     Laci Videmsky, Project Director

What we are making

   The original California Water Atlas described the water system of
   California through many maps and infographics.

   These are proposed interactive projects that are being created as a new
   Public Work for Californians.

   As an open source and collaborative effort, there are plenty of maps to
   make. Please help. We need all kinds of expertise: programmers,
   designers, scientists, writers, documentary-makers and more.
