Ph.D. Attrition

   Leonard Cassuto writes in the Chronicle an article [5]Ph.D. Attrition:
   How Much Is Too Much? He presupposes the answer with the subtitle "A
   disturbing 50 percent of doctoral students leave graduate school
   without finishing".
   The 50% goes over all fields but the numbers in computer science are
   somewhat in that range. Computer Science has different issues than
   humanities and theoretical CS has not quite the same issues as the rest
   of CS. Certainly we lose several students to start-ups and high-paying
   jobs. But what about the ones that just have trouble in grad school.
   Cassuto writes

     Perhaps they lack the temperament to work on their own (which
     undergraduate work does not test as severely as graduate school
     does), or perhaps they lack, say, the mathematical chops necessary
     to succeed at advanced physics. But there will be a number--and if
     admissions committees do a good job, it will be very small--who
     won't be able to finish because they're not up to the demands of the
     task.

   Having read through many graduate applications through the year there
   are very few, perhaps on average one or two a year, that will clearly
   succeed through graduate school. Almost without exception those
   students go to MIT or Berkeley.
   For the rest of us, you have a choice. You can either take someone who
   will probably work their way to a Ph.D. but with uninspired research,
   or those you can take a risk with a student who might have strong
   potential. Some of those students become great scientists, some of them
   flame out. You get a higher attrition rate by taking risks but that's
   not a bad thing.
   If you do take a risk in admissions you need to encourage students to
   "pursue other opportunities" once you realize they won't make it.
   That's a process that too many of us try to avoid, so we don't take
   those risks as much as we should.

       It appears to me that another issue that we do not like to address
       is how often talented and bright students are discouraged by
       sub-optimal advising. Perhaps this is not often an issue in TCS,
       where most of us tend to advise a small number of students, but
       what about larger systems groups? What about chemistry, biology,
       etc? How much talent goes wasted?
       Talent is a difficult resource to deal with, and fresh graduate
       students are human beings with different levels of maturity.
       Finding an appropriate advisor-student match at the personal level,
       more than at the subject level, still remains one of the major
       challenges of grad school. Sometimes, going to the highest-ranked
       school one is admitted to is not necessarily the best choice.
       Of course, some smart people find a way out no matter what, but
       some fantastic colleagues are who they have become only thanks to
       their amazing advisors ...

       Is the 50% drop out rate really a problem.
       If they drop out QUICKLY, like in the first 2 years, and get (say)
       a masters degree, thus didn't waste that much of their time or
       the schools time, thats OKAY. They might not have wasted ANY of
       their time since they learned some other stuff and got a Masters.
       They may not have wasted ANY of the schools time if they did a
       short
       project and/or was a TA.
       If they drop out after more than that then its a bigger problem.
       I want to say that the solution is to have a tough qualifying exam
       system or some mechanism to get students who shouldn't be there
       out after \le 2 years. But there are problems with that also.

       My advisor wins the heart of students by doing a very good job at
       teaching. It takes about 2 years (after the qual, so 4 years into
       the program) to dawn on the student that this dude might be inept
       as a researcher -- however, the dude puts such a good front that
       the student always doubts his own potential. After 2 years, the
       prelim deadline arrives and the student is forced out of the
       program.
       Those who survive the dude realize his game within 1 year, by which
       point they start ignoring him, ask their own questions and obtain
       their own results (to which the dude bullies his name of course).

       Some departments/groups have a "weed them out" mentality that can
       lead to really high drop out rates. Lets face it some departments
       have a hostile atmosphere. I know of a large math department that
       is internationally known for treating first year students like
       products on assembly line to be weeded out. The physics and CS
       departments at the same school have completely different cultures
       even though they are all located right next to each other.
       I would say that qual exam scores are not a reliable indicator of
       who will do good research. Maybe algorithms/complexity is
       different, but so much of research requires patience and
       persistence and the ability to work on your own, which just isn't
       measured in the exam system. I know a prof in the PL area who makes
       his students take masters level classes in algebra, topology, and
       logic and will swear that students that excel at his school's
       breath requirements in CS but flounder in the math don't do good
       work in any area of CS, but it doesn't really matter about the
       results in the CS quals. I'm sure some of the systems folks will
       disagree, but it's an interesting argument.
       One thing that shocked me over the years was that how many students
       enter a PhD program with no idea of why they really want to be
       there. Assuming it's a top program they all tend to have good
       grades and did some summer internships that bored them and decide
       to try for the PhD. I've met kids coming strait out of big
       midwestern schools who start a PhD because they like the whole
       "college town" thing -- being in the marching band, being in a town
       of 30K other 20 year olds, etc. They have no idea what grad school
       is about and never seem to succeed. A good percentage of the
       international students seem to know that this helps game the US
       visa program.
       We all know really good candidates who get turned off by bad
       advising. What happens when Jane comes to Alpha University to work
       on X with prof Y and she just doesn't fit with that group. If she
       still wants to work in X, but there aren't other professors in that
       area, she probably drops out. When an advisor goes off to work in a
       start up or leaves the university or for whatever reason just seems
       to be inattentive the attrition rate can be real high. If a
       professor has ten or more students I will guarantee they have a
       high attrition rate. The prof with four students probably does
       better with the student who needs early direction.

       I think had school for many is just a culture shock plain and
       simple. I think there's a misunderstanding that just because you
       can program well or multiply large numbers that you should get a
       PhD in cs or math respectively. I definitely don't think those
       skills are unnecessary but I think that they're somewhat
       perpendicular to the theoretical skills that are needed in grad
       school.
       Then to take it a step further, some students (ans dare I say most
       grad school students) are used to being the best of the best and
       the concept of asking for help or being tutored if a foreign
       concept to them. I compare it to being a first round draft pick in
       the nfl and expecting that college success to carry over. I mean,
       I'll say God bless you if you're the one who makes it through that
       rookie season (or rookie contact) without growing pains, but most
       players have them. And I'd think that most students have them as
       well, especially in that grad school atmosphere where there is
       sometimes a much larger gap between what's covered in the text (if
       there is a text) and the lecture notes. So like we hear of
       athletes, many early graduate students spend countless hours trying
       to master their craft. Question often becomes how good are they at
       teaching themselves and/or how good are they at asking questions
       and asking for help?

       I think that in TCS also a weak candidate can eventually get
       his/her PhD, since the advisor always has the choice to select an
       easier though less important topic. It may be some purely academic
       variation of something already known, some combinatorial tinkering,
       etc. I think every researcher can come up with a wealth of such
       doable, though not really important topics, some by-products or
       fall-out of research. On the other hand this is not really
       interesting to supervise and you may waste your time on behalf of
       the student. Much better would be a student who solves some of your
       research problems or advances the borders. But this is probably the
       rare case of the top players and definitely not the average.

       To the previous anonymous. I don't see why TCS is singled out in
       this regard. Every PhD program faces the same issues. Some times
       the student is not strong enough, some times they have bad luck in
       finding a thesis topic and some times the advisor does not do their
       job well and so on. It is no different than in any other aspect of
       life that we have a continuum of achievement in terms of what ever
       metric one chooses.

       After graduation, the pro-vice-chancellor told me (to motivate me
       to bring students to the university), he said:"One good thing to
       know is that the british government has done a study on how the
       Ph.D. process is organized, and our university has got number one."
       I replied:"I'm not surprised, that's why I sacked my supervisor."
       He laughed:"Ha Ha Ha..."

       As background to this post, please let me say that I am one of the
       many people who use (and like) the BibDesk/megafile method of
       organizing citations. It's worth filling in the "keyword" field
       carefully ... the sweet spot is a keyword that is associated to
       10-50 citations.
       In regard to PhD attrition, three recently added keywords (because
       they are sharply up-trending in the literature) are
       [40]"naturality", "reconsolidation", and "immiseration"
       The literature associated to these three keywords, in aggregate,
       supports the integrative thesis that the first keyword (namely
       "naturality" of mathematical expression) can concretely guide the
       second keyword (namely "reconsolidation" of integrative STEM
       capabilities) in service of remediating the third keyword (namely
       the generation-long immiseration of the STEM enterprise that
       particularly afflicts young people).
       Summary At present "naturality" is used mainly by mathematicians;
       the word "reconsolidation" is used mainly by cognitive scientists;
       and "immiseration" is used mainly by economists and historians
       (Marxists especially!). Yet in the 21st century, for solidly
       practical reasons (as it seems to me), the STEM professions should
       embrace all three of these notions, and make them their own.

            The post recognizes burgeoning STEM trends:
            o 9,907 MathOverflow queries that contain the (mathematical)
            word natural, and
            o 584 PubMed articles (almost all of them recent) that contain
            the (neuro-cognitive) word reconsolidation, and
            o The once-rare economic word immiseration, which is broadly
            the subject of several of Lance's and Bill's recent posts, and
            is becoming (regrettably) the generic lot of STEM graduate
            students.
            To what degree can any one of these three topics be analyzed
            in isolation from the other two?
            That is a question regarding which it is best that everyone
            not think alike. An outstanding resource for reflection is
            Bill Thurston's On Proof and Progress in Mathematics, which
            vividly illuminates all three topics.

       Do you know what they call a student below the ability level and/or
       the temperament to do solid work on their own for a Ph.D. who gets
       through his program on the sympathy of faculty after many years of
       kicking around the department?
       Doctor.
       We should not see a Ph.D. as an entitlement. It is bad enough that
       a B.S. is becoming easier to push through because of mandatory pass

       It is probably really helpful to be blunt and express concern for
       the student who might not make it, because just encouraging the
       student to pursue other opportunities might not be enough to push
       him to realize that he might not make it.

       "Academic attrition" memes are becoming culturally prevalent --
       sometimes as satirical expressions that are [58]merely discomfiting
       to high-level academic establishments -- sometimes as expressions
       of mathematical and cognitive reconsolidation that enjoy massive
       popularity and are [59]so eerily beautiful as to be scarcely
