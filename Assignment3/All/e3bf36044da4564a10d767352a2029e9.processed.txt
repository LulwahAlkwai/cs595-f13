Turning the Tables at a Messy Hackathon

   [25]Software | May 14, 2013 9:22 am
   At the TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon in New York, April 27, 2013.

   At the TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon in New York, April 27, 2013.

   There are two kinds of hackathons that I'm familiar with. The first, of
   which Evernote produces more than a dozen a year, are focused on one
   (or maybe two) platforms -- like the Evernote API. Companies like ours
   will set up a space for a 24-hour coding spree, invite a bunch of
   developers, and parachute in a few engineers and evangelists to help
   out.

   Focused hackathons are fun and productive. They're a chance for us to
   bond with young (usually) developers, and to learn what these devs are
   looking for as they bang on our platform. We always get cool projects
   from these hackathons, like [26]Context Booster from our recent Berlin
   hack, and [27]Epicnote from one before that in Sao Paulo.

   But I'm partial to the second kind of hackathon: the Messy Hack. These
   hacks, like the [28]TechCrunch Disrupt weekend hackathons that usually
   precede the official Disrupt conferences, are massive and chaotic. They
   attract hundreds of developers -- the [29]last TechCrunch hack in New
   York had about 600 -- and dozens of API provider companies. I was at
   this Messy Hack. It was glorious.

   At these hackathons, platform companies like Evernote have to compete
   with other platform companies (In New York they included [30]Twilio,
   [31]Microsoft, [32]Box, and others) for attention and love from
   developers.

   I spent more than 20 years covering startups for the tech press, and
   I'm accustomed to watching new tech company CEOs pitch their hearts out
   to media, funding sources, and potential partner companies. The pecking
   order is clear: The startups are the supplicants; the established
   companies and media are the power brokers. I'm used to being in the
   power seat.

   At a Messy Hack, the dynamic is reversed. The coders are in the
   audience, doling out attention to a string of platform evangelists who
   take the stage, one after the other, pleading in their brief pitches
   for the devs to code up apps using their APIs.

   It's a bracing reversal. Personally, I find it fun to pitch for a
   change, instead of being pitched. But it's also a great opportunity to
   refine your business and your message. You can tell, after a few short
   hours, if your pitch is successful, and by extension if your company's
   platform strategy is working. You tell by the number of developers who
   come up to your table during the hackathon to ask questions, and then
   you tell, at the end of the event, by the number and quality of the
   projects presented.

   Another great thing about Messy Hacks: Mashups. With multiple APIs
   being supported at these events, developers are more likely to go off
   and build apps that bring different platforms together.
   Don't bother trying to leave. Just sit down and code.

   Don't bother trying to leave. Just sit down and code.

Hacking the hackathon

   Now, it's not hard for platform companies to game these hackathons, by
   offering prizes to developers who use their APIs. We have done that,
   and it does drum up interest from hackers who come to have some fun and
   maybe win a few bucks over the weekend. In New York, some companies
   with serious APIs offered prizes, and they got some decent projects.
   But at least one company offered a prize that was too big for the value
   of its simple API (in my editorial judgement) and it got more projects
   created than it deserved. Hacks created just to win a prize have a
   lower probability of moving to the next stage of development; the
   payout is too much and too early.

   At the recent New York TechCrunch hackathon, we offered no immediate
   prizes, and yet we were gratified to see six teams present interesting
   projects at the end of the event. My favorite was [33]Squirrel, which
   is creating a nice-looking reading list that's made up of the articles
   users clip to Evernote. We also liked the hacks [34]Everslide, which
   makes quick presentation slides from Evernote notes; and
   [35]Evernote-Quick Team Manager, which mashes Evernote together with
   [36]Highrise or [37]Basecamp for group task management.

   It was all the sweeter to see these projects given the competition we
   were up against and the fact that our only prize was far in the future
   -- well-developed Evernote integrations might win our three-month-long
   [38]Devcup competition and some of those winners might be invited to
   our [39]Evernote Accelerator. And, to be fair, there were [40]183
   projects at the hackathon, so seeing six Evernote projects didn't mean
   we "won" the event by any stretch.

   But the developers who built for Evernote did so for the best reasons:
   They saw value in our API and our base of users. While we're not above
   sweetening the pot a bit to encourage developers who are on the fence
   to to hack at Evernote, in this case, we didn't even do that and we
   still got neat projects.

   A competitive hackathon where you don't give out prizes is a brutal
   opportunity. But the payoff is sweet.
