The National Science Foundation Provides $5.2 Million Grant to Create New
Advanced Placement® Computer Science Course and Exam

   Innovative College-Level AP® Course Created to Increase Interest in
   Computing Degrees and Careers, Particularly Among Female and Minority
   Students
   06/13/2013

   New York -- Information technology drives our global economy, underlies
   recent advances in science and engineering, and promises
   transformational approaches to our world's most serious challenges,
   including health care, education and environmental remediation. Yet,
   collectively, a smaller percentage of American high school students
   take computer science courses today than they did 20 years ago.

   To help ensure that more high school students are prepared to pursue
   postsecondary education in computer science, the National Science
   Foundation (NSF) is making a four-year, $5.2 million grant to the
   College Board's Advanced Placement Program^® (AP^®) to fund the
   creation of AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP).

   Details of the new AP CSP course and exam will be announced at the
   third annual Clinton Global Initiative America (CGI America) meeting as
   a "Commitment to Action" -- a new plan to give hundreds of thousands of
   students access to a computational education and to prepare them for
   careers in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math)
   disciplines, particularly female and minority students who are
   traditionally underrepresented in college computing degrees and
   industries. The long-term goal of this commitment is to promote
   business growth and innovation and improve our nation's competiveness
   in today's global economy.

   The college-level AP CSP course will be introduced into thousands of
   high schools nationwide in fall 2016, with the first AP CSP Exam set to
   be administered in May 2017. Unlike computer science courses that focus
   on programming, AP CSP has been designed to help students explore the
   creative aspects of computing while also providing a solid academic
   foundation for understanding the intellectual concepts and practical
   contributions of computing. AP CSP includes a curriculum framework
   designed to promote learning with understanding, a digital portfolio to
   promote student participation throughout the year, and a course and
   assessment that is independent of programming language.

   "We are very excited to offer high school students the opportunity to
   take a college-level computing course that diverges from standard
   introductory computer science courses in ways that are designed to
   promote the interests of students from a broad range of disciplines,"
   said Trevor Packer, senior vice president of AP and Instruction. "With
   AP Computer Science Principles, we hope to engage a larger, more
   diverse group of students who will go on to pursue computer science
   learning and the innovative careers associated with computing."

   Although computing is among the fastest-growing areas of projected job
   growth, the industry is failing to attract our nation's most talented
   students. Of the 1.6 million bachelor's degrees conferred in 2009-10,
   only 38,500 (2.4 percent) were earned in computer science -- and only
   6,894 (slightly over one quarter) of those were conferred to female
   students. White students earned 60 percent of computer science degrees
   in 2009-10, while black/African American and Hispanic students
   accounted for 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively, of those earning
   computer science degrees during the same period.

   Successful implementation of the AP CSP course will hinge on the
   ability to recruit and train qualified teachers with computer science
   backgrounds to teach the course. Through its CS 10K Project (10,000
   computer science teachers in 10,000 high schools by 2016), NSF has been
   laying the foundation for an unprecedented, national effort to prepare
   educators to teach this new material using hands-on, inclusive
   curricula.

   In addition, the College Board is building a comprehensive set of
   online teaching resources and creating professional development
   curricula for teachers, giving them the support they need to help
   students succeed in the AP CSP course and on the exam. As part of this
   effort, the College Board will contribute $1.5 million toward the
   creation of teacher support materials and professional development, and
   $2 million to develop a platform that will deliver the recommended
   digital portfolio assessment.

   "A key to the success of the AP CSP and the CS 10K initiative is the
   strong collaboration among the computer science education community,
   the National Science Foundation, the College Board, computing
   professional societies and other STEM organizations," said Jan Cuny,
   program officer at the NSF. "Many voices have come together to
   articulate the need for a rigorous and engaging computing curriculum
   that will attract a broad audience of students, educate them about the
   value of computing and encourage them to lead the world in IT
   innovation."

   AP CSP was piloted during the 2010-11 academic year at five
   universities. Each institution developed and implemented a recruitment
   plan for increasing enrollment of women and underrepresented
   minorities, and each course instructor contributed to course evaluation
   activities. During the 2011-12 academic year, AP CSP was piloted at
   another 10 colleges and universities paired with 10 high schools. All
   pilot sites in this second phase were chosen according to criteria
   including geography, the ability to enroll a diverse population of
   students and the capacity to partner with another institution. In
   addition to participating in surveys and evaluation activities,
   instructors contributed to the research component of the project by
   submitting a course syllabus and implementing a portfolio assessment.

   Owen Astrachan, professor of the practice of computer science at Duke
   University, has been the Principal Investigator of the CS Principles
   team and project since its inception in 2008. He was part of the small
   leadership group that created the curriculum framework for the course,
   guided the revisions of that framework by a larger advisory board and
   was a member of the team that ensured the recognition of the CS
   Principles project by the higher education community.

   "The CS Principles project is integral to the development of an
   intellectual foundation for computer science for high school and
   college students and is part of the foundation of a national initiative
   that will help ensure a vibrant, competitive and productive workforce
   in nearly every field," said Astrachan. "CS Principles is a model in
   both the U.S. and throughout the world in introducing students to the
   creative, productive and enriching field that can be the basis for
   further study and work."

   The successful pilots in 2010-11 and 2011-12 have helped to engender
   widespread enthusiasm for the success of the new AP CSP course. In a
   recent survey of 103 of the nation's top colleges and universities, 87
   percent confirmed that AP CSP requires the same content knowledge and
   skills as the related introductory college course, and 86 percent
   indicated a willingness to award college credit for qualifying scores
   on future AP CSP Exams.

   Amy Briggs is a professor of computer science at Middlebury College in
   Vermont and teaches courses throughout the undergraduate computer
   science curriculum. She is a co-Principal Investigator working with
   Owen Astrachan in the development of the AP CSP curriculum framework.

   "Populations of students who have previously lacked access to high
   school computing classes -- or shied away from them, especially girls
   and underrepresented minorities -- will benefit from the greater access
   to computing education that CS Principles will bring," said Briggs.

   An additional 38 high schools and 12 colleges and universities will
   pilot the AP CSP course through spring 2016.

   While the College Board remains committed to improving equity in and
   access to all AP courses, its importance is amplified among the STEM
   disciplines. Research shows that students who took college-level AP
   math or science exams during high school were more likely than non-AP
   students to earn degrees in physical science, engineering and life
   science disciplines -- the fields leading to careers essential for the
   nation's future prosperity.

   The addition of AP CSP will bring the number of AP courses and exams
   within the STEM disciplines to11. The others are: Biology, Calculus AB,
   Calculus BC, Chemistry, Computer Science A, Environmental Science,
   Physics B, Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism, Physics C: Mechanics,
   and Statistics. AP CSP will be the first new AP course and exam since
   AP Chinese Language and Culture and AP Japanese Language and Culture
   were implemented in fall 2006.
