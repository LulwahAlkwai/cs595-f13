   Anticipating the Syrian Cyber Counter Attack: Suggest you buy a
   generator. @WSJThisMorning #syria
   In my Wall Street Journal This Morning radio segment I discuss the
   Syrian warning shot last week which was apparently intended to showcase
   they could attack US infrastructure and that the electrical grid was
   the most likely target. This is why I think the Obama administration
   moved to get congressional approval because politicians tend to want
   the credit when they figure things will go well and to share the blame
   if they go south badly. It fascinates me that we don't even really
   appear to be preparing for this likely outcome and instead seem to be
   working to assure no one group can be isolated and blamed while given
   Syria weeks to prepare. If you have a generator or are off-grid you are
   ahead of this game. You can listen to my argument here:
