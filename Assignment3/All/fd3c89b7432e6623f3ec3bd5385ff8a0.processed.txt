Are you ready to share your broadband?

   [26]Infrastructure | May 6, 2013 9:18 am

   The Karma mobile hotspot is $79, plus pay-as-you-go bandwidth.

   The Karma mobile hotspot is $79, plus pay-as-you-go bandwidth.
   "WiFi is a resource that can be collaboratively consumed."

   That's the oracular wisdom that Robert Gaal, co-founder of [27]Karma,
   dropped on me halfway into our interview. Let's have it sink in for a
   bit before we continue.

   Ready? Karma is the wireless hotspot -- like a [28]MiFi -- that comes
   with social sharing as part of the offering. It also has a more
   sensible pricing structure than competitors. Bandwidth is
   pay-as-you-go, $14 a gigabyte, and your credits don't expire. That is a
   refreshing change from telco access points that lock you in to
   contracts. Even the month-to-month data plans (like you get on iPads)
   seem onerous in comparison. So props to Karma for rationalizing the
   hotspot space.

   The social and collaborative part of the product is the connection
   sharing scheme. Every Karma hotspot is part yours, and part the
   community's. "Your" hotspot provides 100MB of data to any and all
   visitors for free, after which they can sign up to pay for the service
   just like you. And for every 100MB of data that visitors use, you get
   100MB of bandwidth added to your account.

   So it pays to leave your hotspot on so others can use it. And it gets
   even more communal. While Karma won't let a hotspot owner see traffic
   from guest users, it does tell you who is using your device and
   bandwidth. Owners get guests' names and links to their Facebook
   profiles. Gaal says that often, when owners see they have a guest, they
   will try to find that person and be helpful. "It's all to get guests
   engaged in the community."
   Visitors to "your" hotspot can get 100MB of bandwidth for free.

   Visitors to "your" hotspot can get 100MB of bandwidth for free.

   Karma is, to a point, a refinement on some other community bandwidth
   products. It can be compared to [29]Fon, which distributes fixed,
   ethernet-to-WiFi routers. The model is similar: Owners get priority
   access, and guests from the network (other Fon users) can use a portion
   of the bandwidth when they're not at their own home. Fon is having some
   success working with carriers, for whom it can help create a better
   consumer experience. Karma's Gaal, likewise, thinks that his product
   can make a carrier's bandwidth more pervasive and affordable.

   I love these communal resource plays.

   I'm also closely tracking [30]Open Garden, which turns your Android (or
   OS X or Windows) device into a community hotspot on its shared WiFi
   network. In other words, everyone in range of an Open Garden-equipped
   device can share bandwidth. (And sharing can happen over Bluetooth, so
   endpoint users can save on battery life.) it is an awesome solution for
   people with both an Android phone and a tablet. It would be good for
   iPhone + iPad users too, except getting low-level networking stuff like
   this into iOS isn't doable.

   And then there's [31]Space Monkey, which does a communal bandwidth
   thing with storage: It puts the file storage "cloud" into homes of
   users. Those who have a Space Monkey storage appliance in their home
   get half of the storage for themselves, and the other half is encrypted
   and shared by other Space Monkey users. It's a mesh of storage nodes,
   essentially, and it's elegant and robust.

   The challenge with all of these ideas is getting the owned/shared ratio
   right. Too much sharing will turn off individual device owners, who do
   pay to run their slice of the community network, either in bandwidth
   fees or diminished battery life. Too little sharing and the economics
   don't work for the provider company. So everyone in this space goes a
   step beyond feel-good community sharing to give the owners something
   extra: Free bandwidth (Karma), an extended network (Fon; OpenGarden);
   or increased reliability (Space Monkey).

   And then there's the danger of running afoul of the network owners.
   That's why the companies that aggressively partner with telcos have the
   best chances of success, even if doing those deals can really slow down
   roll-outs.

   But the real challenge is that all these community plays, while
   technically beautiful, are fighting macro trends. The costs of
   bandwidth and storage are dropping; the pervasiveness of wireless is
   increasing. The economics that may work now will not work forever.
   Anyone doing a community resource sharing play has to carefully surf
   very choppy waves, and companies that fall off their boards may have a
   hard time getting back up.

       Great article. And those are good ideas. Have you heard of Vitel?
       We offer an option, called ViFi ([38]http://gofor3.myvifi.com/),
       which is very similar. The device is $79.99 and there is no
       contract or activation fees and you can use it as a mobile hotspot.
       It isn't a "social" type hotspot, but you you can vary your data
       plan. Curious if you might have tried it. Thanks for the great
       info.
