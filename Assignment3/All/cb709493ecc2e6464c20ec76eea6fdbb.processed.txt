Plainclothes officers in trouble - didn't recognize off-duty chief

   Three-star NYPD Chief Douglas Zeigler

Three-star NYPD Chief Douglas Zeigler

   At least one cop has been disciplined for ordering the [33]NYPD's
   highest-ranking uniformed black officer out of his auto while the
   three-star chief was off-duty and parked in [34]Queens, the Daily News
   has learned.

   "How you can not know or recognize a chief in a department SUV with ID
   around his neck, I don't know," a police source said.

   Chief Douglas Zeigler, 60, head of the [35]Community Affairs Bureau,
   was in his NYPD-issued vehicle near a fire hydrant when two
   plainclothes cops approached on May 2, sources said.

   One officer walked up on each side of the SUV at 57th Ave. and Xenia
   St. in [36]Corona about 7 p.m. and told the driver to roll down the
   heavily tinted windows, sources said.

   What happened next is in dispute.

   In his briefing to [37]Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, [38]Zeigler
   said the two cops, who are white, had no legitimate reason to approach
   his SUV, ranking sources said.

   After they ordered him to get out, one officer did not believe the NYPD
   identification Zeigler gave him.

   The cops gave a different account:

   When one officer spotted Zeigler's service weapon through the
   rolled-down window, he yelled "Gun!" according to sources who have
   spoken with the officers.

   Both cops raised their weapons and ordered the driver out of the car,
   sources said.

   Instead of saying he was an armed member of the NYPD, Zeigler shouted,
   "Don't you know who I am?" the sources said.

   When one cop reached over to check the identification badge around
   Zeigler's neck, the chief pushed him away, sources said.

   Only then did Zeigler tell the two officers his name and rank, those
   sources said.

   Zeigler, in his discussions with Kelly, said the officers never yelled
   "Gun!" sources said.

   One cop got into a heated argument with the chief even after seeing the
   ID, sources said.

   That cop was stripped of his gun and badge and placed on modified duty
   last night, sources said. The status of the second officer was unclear.

   The incident occurred as the NYPD is under fire for record numbers of
   pedestrians being stopped and frisked, the majority of them black or
   Hispanic. Some 145,098 people were stopped by the NYPD in the first
   quarter of this year.

   Zeigler has headed the Community Affairs Bureau since January 2006. His
   wife, Neldra Zeigler, is NYPD deputy commissioner for equal employment
   opportunity.

[110]Investors confuse Tweeter with Twitter

   [111]Snow is piled in front of the vacant Tweeter electronics store in
   Salem, NH, Friday Jan. 30, 2009. The US economy has been battered by

   tighter to their wallets in the final three months of 2008 for the
   worst downhill slide in a quarter-century. Americans cut spending on
   everything from cars to computers, and it's only getting worse so far
   in the new year. The Tweeter chain closed in December of 2008. (AP
