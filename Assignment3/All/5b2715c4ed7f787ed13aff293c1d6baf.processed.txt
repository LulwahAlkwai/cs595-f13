New Course: The Design of Everyday Things

   [5][Cover+DOET2+Cover+May+25,+2013.jpg]
   After reading The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman, I remember
   thinking to myself, "I probably learned more from this book than I
   learned from a majority of classes I took in graduate school." This
   wasn't the best feeling in the face of my $60,000+ graduate school
   loans!
   My loans feel less painful though if they mean I can help others avoid
   student loan debt. This is why I'm thrilled to announce Udacity's
   production of Design 101: The Design of Everyday Things. This series of
   courses is taught by Don Norman, Kristian Simsarian, and myself, and
   I'm confident will help current and potential designers be successful
   in their careers. Oh, and the best part....the class is offered to
   students for free! An equivalent course at a university would probably
   cost $5,000 or more.
   Design 101: The Design of Everyday Things is based upon the new edition
   of The Design of Everyday Things (revised and expanded: to be published
   in Fall 2013). The material is been divided into three or four short
   courses (the exact number to be determined), each of which can be taken
   independently, offering students considerable flexibility. The
   components provide the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to
   understand the role of design in today's world. We use lively videos,
   assign hands-on exercises, and provide an interactive discussion forum
   to aid in exploring principles of interaction design, human cognition
   and emotion, and how to become a design thinker and even a design
   doer.
   What kind of design? Any design that focuses upon the interaction of
   people with technology: the fundamental principles are the same for
   software interaction and hardware, interaction design, experience
   design, and industrial design.
   We also cover in these courses the relationship between design and
   business, and incorporate career discussions and advice from successful
   designers across diverse industries.
   Design 101: The Design of Everyday Things will be an insightful track
   for those at all stages of their design careers, but I especially
   recommend it for those deciding if a career in design is the right
   path. Lots of designers are self taught these days; the series could
   provide you with enough information to get started in your design
   career without spending $60,000+ on a formal degree program.
   Every opportunity I've had in my career has been a result of a referral
   from someone in my network. By taking Design 101: The Design of
   Everyday Things, you'll also gain a vibrant network of others who are
   at diverse points in their design careers. We expect you'll learn just
   as much from the course community as you will from us!
   Check out the overview page for more information and to sign up for the
   courses, which are tentatively scheduled to start this fall:

   See you in class soon!
