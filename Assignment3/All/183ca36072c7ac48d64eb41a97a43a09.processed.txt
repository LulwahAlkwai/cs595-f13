The Legacy of Ted Parker

   By [79]Annetta on Wednesday, July 31st, 2013 - [80]27 Comments

   This post was written by Tim Gallagher, editor of Living Bird magazine.

   August 3, 2013, marks the 20th anniversary of the death of renowned
   ornithologist Theodore A. Parker III, who is widely regarded as one of
   the greatest field biologists of the 20th century. A dedicated
   conservationist, he died in a plane crash while surveying a remote
   cloud forest in Ecuador.

   Only 40 years old at the time of his death, Ted was a specialist in the
   birds of South America and spent the bulk of his adult life working in
   tropical rainforests in Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, and other
   countries in the region. He had a phenomenal ability to remember
   wildlife sounds and could instantly identify more than 4,000 bird
   species by their songs alone. He made high-quality sound recordings of
   wildlife wherever he traveled, and always wrote meticulous field notes
   to accompany them.

   Ted was an amazing person right from the start. Even as a child, he
   knew he wanted to be a naturalist and spent countless hours exploring
   the woods and fields around his home in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He was
   an avid birder since childhood and in 1971-during his last semester of
   high school and first semester of college-he did a big year, tallying
   627 species in a single year, smashing the existing big-year record of
   598 species.

   Ted Parker's importance in shaping the vision and direction of the
   Cornell Lab of Ornithology cannot be overstated. He was a prominent
   member of the Lab's administrative board and pushed successfully for a
   stronger emphasis on conservation. He certainly had an influence on the
   direction of Living Bird. I'll never forget the first time I met him,
   in 1991, just a few months after I'd moved to Ithaca from California to
   become editor of the magazine. At that time, I'd only put out two
   issues of the magazine. Ted was here to add some new bird sound
   recordings to the Lab's collection and edit and catalog them. He sat in
   my office and basically took me to task for not doing more for
   conservation. I was taken aback. I told him I'd taken this job in the
   hope that I could do some good for wildlife conservation. And he said,
   "What are you waiting for?"

   It was a point well taken, and by the end of our talk, I felt inspired.
   On the cover of the very next issue, I put the phrase "For the Study
   and Conservation of Birds" right under the Living Bird logo, just so no
   one would have any doubt about our editorial mission, and I began
   publishing more articles on bird conservation.

   Ted was a vital contributor to the Cornell Lab's Macaulay Library (then
   called the Library of Natural Sounds) and helped build this sound
   archive into the world-class collection that it is today, adding some
   10,000 recordings to the collection, representing more than 2,000
   species of birds, mammals, and amphibians.

   Ted's death was a staggering loss to the conservation community. He was
   a [81]senior scientist at Conservation International at the time of his
   death and leader of the group's Rapid Assessment Program (RAP), which
   took a small team of top scientists to remote areas in the tropics that
   had never been biologically surveyed and determined their level of
   biodiversity and potential for conservation, accomplishing in a matter
   of days what previously might have taken individual scientists months
   or years. These areas often faced imminent environmental destruction,
   and it was always a race to save them. (This kind of rapid-assessment
   survey has since become a mainstay of conservation science.)

   Ted Parker had a deep passion for conservation. With this, and his
   incredible drive and charisma, he made things happen. The RAP program
   was Ted's brainchild, and he assembled its first team--which included
   legendary botanist, Al Gentry, who also died with him in the plane
   crash. Their initial expedition was to the Madidi region of Bolivia,
   which turned out to be one of the most biologically diverse areas on
   the entire planet. In a face-to-face meeting with the president of
   Bolivia, Ted discussed the results of the RAP survey and stressed the
   importance of saving this unique area. As a result of these efforts,
   Bolivia established Madidi National Park, setting aside a staggering
   4.5 million acres of tropical wilderness--an area the size of New
   Jersey.

   Ted continued leading RAP team surveys, and he was on one--conducting
   an aerial survey of an Ecuadorian cloud forest--in August 1993 when the
   airplane crashed, killing him and four of his colleagues. Looking back
   on Ted's brief life, we can only marvel at all that he accomplished and
   draw inspiration from the example he set.

   In Ted Parker's honor, the Cornell Lab is offering a [82]free digital
   download of his recordings from "[83]Voices of the Peruvian
   Rainforest," which was first produced as an audiocassette in 1985. The
   Lab has also launched a [84]special effort to pay the cost of shipping
   Ted Parker's bird sound guides to schoolchildren and conservationists
   in Latin America and the Caribbean.

       Every birder and conservationist in the world should stand in awe
       of what Ted Parker was able to accomplish in such a short amount of
       time. Anyone who has ever picked up a copy of Kingbird Highway
       knows how amazing he was even as a very young person. Thank god
       that that world of ornithology, birding and conservation was
       blessed to have this man as our advocate if even just for a very
       abbreviated time. Thank you, Ted and may you rest in peace. May all
       the birds of the world sing for you!

       Great tribute to Ted Parker !!!!
       Now do one on BEN Coffey Jr., a close friend of Ted's
       I helped BEN band over 100,000 swifts. Not an ornithologist, Ben
       lived birding, and received 3 pages in the AUK upon his death.

       I've always been interested in Ted Parker, and thought he was an
       amazing person. Don Stap's "A Parrot With No Name," I believe, has
       some really interesting writing on Parker. Thanks for the tip on
       Kingbird Highway, which I hadn't heard of and will check out,

            Yes, I know that Kingbird Highway is a memoir of Kenn's early
            days in birding, but Ted Parker was a good friend of Kenn's
            and the book provides a great portrait of Ted when he was
            younger. Reading both of these books you can learn a great
            deal about Ted.

       This is such a poignant piece. His legacies of recordings at the
       Lab and the concept of rapid assessment are breathtaking memorials
       to his brilliance and life's work. I wish I had met him.

       A few years ago I happened upon a copy of A Parrot Without a Name
       and was dismayed to find out after finishing the book (and googling
       some of the key characters) that Ted Parker had perished so young.
       His passion for conservation and knowledge has been very inspiring
       to me. Although I have had a small interest in conservation, birds
       and birding for many years, my interest has grown phenomenally
       since reading that book. I spend more time birding in my local
       parks and more time on birding holidays. I am subscribing to Living
       Bird and buying some of the bird song recordings (which have been
       very helpful), and started volunteering about a year ago for a
       local conservation group called FLAP. Thanks so much for posting
       this!

       This article on Ted Parker should be taken personally to the Bill
       Gates and Warren Buffets and every other deep pocket businessman
       until somebody steps forward to create an endowment in the honor of
       Ted Parker so that funding can put 10 more Ted Parkers out there
       helping to save the planet from the outrageous destruction of
       today. Gates and Buffet and other world's richest hold meetings to
       discuss what they can do with their money. PLEASE be there to show
       them why Cornell deserves to be in line. Even businessmen, if shown
       the proper story, will realize a planet without biodiversity will
       be a life not worth living.

       I'll share a personal anecdote about Ted that dates back to the
       1980s when he was a tour leader for VENT out of Austin. This was at
       a time when VENT still did a few tours in really remote areas that
       required overnight camping. I was the camp outfitter and cook (and
       avid birder) for a Ted-led tour in the Tepuis and lowland rain
       forest of Venezuela, and on one occasion we were walking a
       rainforest trail, surrounded by a chorus of birdcalls, when Ted
       suddenly froze, pointed to the forest, and said, "There, listen,
       did you hear that? That bird should be at least 300 miles from
       here!" Finally, we all picked out the faint call in the distance,
       and Ted said, "We have to find that bird". I recall that we
       eventually did locate the bird, which was a new record for that
       area, although I can't recall the species. All of us were of course
       awestruck by Ted's amazing working vocabulary of bird calls and his
       uncanny ability to instantly recognize and pick out an outlier
       amongst the din of the local chatter.

       My Ted-related story. I never met him, but I recall hearing of his
       passing in such a way that I will never forget it.
       Twenty years ago in 1993, right around this time of year, I was
       attending orientation for new graduate students at NYU. I was just
       entering the Ph.D. program in Biology there. A faculty member from
       the English department got up and began speaking about the recent
       passing of his brother, and described his work studying birds in
       tropical America. The professor's name was Parker, and slowly my
       jaw dropped as I realized he was talking about Ted. I knew of Ted's
       work in the field, but here-on my first day as a Ph.D. student-I
       was hearing for the very first time that he was gone.
       I was President of my local Audubon Society chapter at the time,
       and did a little piece on Ted for our monthly newsletter.
       I still have the old "Voices of the Peruvian Rainforest" tape from
       Cornell, but I'm glad to have the download. I hope a lot of people
       who haven't heard these wonderful recordings will take advantage of
       the opportunity to do so now.
