Word, Excel and PowerPoint for the Nokia Asha 501

   Receiving email attachments when you're out and about can be
   infuriating if you don't have the apps to open those attachments.
   That's unlikely to be a problem for [8]Nokia Asha 501 owners thanks to
   My Pocket Office, with the ability to open and read Microsoft Word,
   Excel and PowerPoint files.

   The apps are currently at a beta stage, but already they're more than
   capable if you want to open files and see what's been sent to you.

   My Pocket Office comes in three distinct flavours, covering Microsoft's
   most popular applications:

   Office-Asha

   [9]My Pocket Office - docx
   The first screen you'll see when you open the app comprises: Open
   files, Recent files and Bookmarks. As the apps are designed for viewing
   documents rather than creating them, there isn't an option to start a
   new document.

   As the name hints, files need to be saved in a docx format before you
   can open them, but I found they opened straight away when converted.

     It's easy to zoom in and out of your documents, thanks to big + and
     - buttons at the top of the app, and if it's something you want to
     read again you can drag up the menu bar from the bottom of the
     screen and tap `Add to bookmarks'. That way, the next time you open
     the app, simply tap `Bookmarks' and select that file.

   The documents I transferred to my Asha 501 were easy to read, but the
   app couldn't recognise certain punctuation marks. It's not a
   deal-breaker if you just want to read your files, but it could make a
   big difference if you want to check that everything is perfect in an
   important document.

     Office-Asha-1

   [10]My Pocket Office - xlsx

   All three of these apps have a similar appearance, making them easy to
   use after you've tried the first. The colour scheme is different for
   each app, with blue for Word, green for Excel and red for PowerPoint -
   as with the icons on the full Microsoft apps themselves.

   When opening my spreadsheets with My Pocket Office - xlsx, they looked
   perfect in miniature. It's easy to swipe around the display to see more
   detail, and once again you can zoom in if the text isn't big enough.

     Office-Asha-3

   [11]My Pocket Office - pptx

   Unlike the other two apps, My Pocket Office - pptx automatically starts
   up in landscape mode. It needs to, as PowerPoint files easily take up
   every millimetre of the Asha 501's display.

   The first presentation I tried to send over to my Asha 501 was some 11
   slides long, so took a couple of minutes to load up. Trying it again
   with smaller presentations resulted in much quicker responses.

   Press the play button and it's possible to switch through all the
   individual slides, and this is where the big + and - zoom buttons
   really came in handy.

   Office-Asha-4

   The slight formatting bugs found in the Word app reared their heads
   again, with hyphens replaced by small squares, but if you just want to
   check information in your slideshow then My Pocket Office - pptx is
   ideal.

   Overall the My Pocket Office apps have a lot of potential. Because
   they're still at a beta stage minor bugs are inevitable, but they're
   surprisingly polished and easy to use. Only some minor formatting
   issues let them down at this point.

       Such a misleading title. It talks about My Pocket Office app which
       is not Microsoft Office and has nothing to do with
       Word/Excel/PowerPoint.
          + http://www.dvlup.com/ Contentqb
            Sorry you feel that way. The apps do the job of being able to
            read & review Word, Excel and PowerPoint files, which is a
            good place to start, and convenient if you need to have a
            quick look at information on the go, or if you want to be able
            to have the information with you, and not carry a laptop along
            for the ride!
               o Satya
                 Yes but those apps are just for name !
               o http://sushubh.net/ chromaniac
                 Based on your comment any app that can open
                 docx/pptx/xlsx can be called Word/Excel/PowerPoint?
                 Awesome.
                 Kindly tell your new parent Microsoft to stop promoting
                 Surface as the only Tablet that has Office.
                    # Siliconsub
                      Still is the only OS that runs Office, they never
                      said the only OS that can open Word/Excel/PowerPoint
                      documents, because iOS and Android can.
                         @ http://sushubh.net/ chromaniac
                           Please suggest what do you get when you read
                           this headline:
                           Word, Excel and PowerPoint for the Nokia Asha
                           501
                           I clicked on this news item in my feed reader
                           because I was astonished to see that Microsoft
                           developed a version of Office for Nokia Asha
                           Platform. I was in fact happy to see the
                           headline.
                           But then I realized that it was a linkbait
                           headline.
                         @ http://www.dvlup.com/ Contentqb
                           Truly sorry you feel that way. I assure that
                           was not the intention. Your feedback is
                           certainly valid, and we will try to ensure that
                           headlines best reflect the subject matter of
                           our stories.

     * Orig

       work...it only open .xlsx, docx, pptx

       501'..
