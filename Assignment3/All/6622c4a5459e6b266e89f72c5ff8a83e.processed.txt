Tina Brown to Leave 'The Daily Beast' This Fall

   Tina Brown will not be with [48]The Daily Beast much longer.

   The Daily Beast's editor-in-chief has decided to leave the publication
   this fall to start her own company, Tina Brown Live Media, which will
   expand on her three-year-old Women in the World conference series a
   spokesperson for Brown's new venture confirmed to Mashable. Brown's
   contract was not up until January, but Brown, apparently, has decided
   to leave early.

   News that Brown was departing was first reported by [49]BuzzFeed, and
   confirmed to Mashable by two sources familiar with the negotiations,
   one of whom added that the site is not shutting down.

   A spokesperson for The Daily Beast has not responded to a request for
   comment.

   The Daily Beast launched under Brown and IAC in fall 2008. It was, at
   first, like a free, web-only version of Vanity Fair, the Conde Nast
   title Brown used to edit. Brown discovered quickly that longform
   features weren't going to generate enough revenue to support The Daily
   Beast alone, and today it balances a mix of original reports with
   aggregated stories and slideshows, bringing in about 6 million unique
   visitors per month, per comScore. It is still not, however, profitable.
   According to [51]Adweek, the publication is slated to lose $12 million
   this year.

   Brown's tenure at The Daily Beast -- and later at Newsweek, which
   merged with The Daily Beast in late 2010 and was [52]sold off earlier
   this year -- has been fraught with drama, both internal and external.
   She has famously clashed with editors and reporters, and been
   criticized for a series of Newsweek covers, like [53]this one of a
   back-from-the-dead Princess Diana, for seeming "desperate."

   The future of The Daily Beast is uncertain. BuzzFeed speculates that
   the publication could be sold, closed (unlikely, in my opinion, given
   the audience size and brand equity at stake -- and our source says it
   won't be) or continue to run under a new editor -- perhaps Executive
   Editor John Avlon.

   Update: A source claiming to be close to the negotiations called after
   we published this piece, emphasizing that Brown -- not IAC --
   "ultimately made the decision to walk away from The Daily Beast" and
   that it's "more of a mutual separating of ways." The source added that
   Brown's relationship with IAC Chairman Barry Diller is "not strained"
   and she continues to have "a ton of respect" for Diller.
