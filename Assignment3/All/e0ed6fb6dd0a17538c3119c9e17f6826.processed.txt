STOC: Some NON-radical ideas

   At the STOC business meeting Joan Feigenbaum (PC chair) raised some
   very good points. There was no real discussion (or perhaps the burning
   car was the discussion). Here are the issues and some thoughts as I see
   them. Note that I am not speaking in any official capacity. I speak of
   STOC but many of my comments apply to other conferences.
   What is the purpose of STOC? Initially it was to help spread knowledge
   of the latest results, through both talks and lunch. Even though we can
   now tweet the latest VDW numbers, STOC still serves this purpose.
   Another (likely unintended) purpose of STOC is to give researchers a
   quick yet prestigious way to publish. Hiring committees and Tenure
   committee's DO ask questions like How many STOC/FOCS publications does
   she have?. Some people think this is an awful system since these papers
   are not refereed carefully. I am not going to debate that here. My only
   concern is making STOC better at spreading knowledge.
   What are some of the problems with STOC?
    1. People don't want to serve on the program committee since its a lot
       of time and they can't submit. The two-tiered system used for STOC
       2013 seems like a good solution to this.
    2. Referees Reports (can we even call them that?) are often not very
       informative. The two-tiered system COULD help this since each
       committee member has less work and there is a small oversight
       committee. Another solution that some conferences use is to give
       the authors a chance to rebut a report and/or rewrite the paper.
       I'll discuss this more in the next point.
    3. Since the reviewing process is rushed there have been papers that
       are just plain WRONG. This can be confusing for someone coming to
       the literature. Also there are throw-away- comments like This can
       easily be extended to the case of weighted graphs. where this is
       not easy at all. How big a problem is this? How much worse than
       Journals is it? I DON"T KNOW. Would the Rebut/Rewrite help this?
       PRO: Referees don't have to decide RIGHT NOW what to do and can ask
       the authors things? CON: More back and fourth, more work. CAVEAT:
       This might make STOC more like a journal with fast turn-around
       time.
    4. Some of the papers never get into Journal Form. Again Rebut/Rewrite
       may help in that the STOC version is better, but this is more
       giving in to the problem rather than solving it. Demanding full
       versions of papers (now possible since with e-proceedings page
       limits are less of an issue) is a good idea (and I think IS being
       used now by STOC).
    5. Many good papers get turned down. Going to three parallel sessions
       would help this. There may be logistical problems here, but I think
       this is a good idea. Are there enough good papers to make this
       work? I think so- and the committee would have the freedom to NOT
       use all the sessions in case there aren't quite enough papers. I do
       not think this would make STOC's prestige decline.
    6. It has been said that only narrow technically hard stuff gets in
       and not simple short new ideas. Its hard to know if this is really
       true. But in any case the three-parallel sessions may help this
       since there would be room for diff types of papers.
    7. Personally I get more out of the workshops and invited talks then
       out of the refereed talks. Hence I would like more of those.
       Posters are good also. More to the point- I would like more VARIETY
       in whats at a conference since people get knowledge in different
       ways.
    8. Can you really communicate your latest and greatest result in a 20
       minute time slot in a crowded room where the adjacent bathroom is
       out of order? Even though we've made great advances in technology
       (I call PowerPoint PROGRESS but some disagree) and in plumbing (in
       the old days STOC people had to use an outhouse- do young people
       even know what an outhouse is anymore?), is there a better way to
       do this? It was suggested that ALL talks be POSTER sessions (NIPS
       does this). This should NOT be viewed as inferior or demeaning so
       long as we still have published proceedings (whatever that means in
       the days of arXiv) and high standards. The only relevant question
       is: Would posters be a better way to convey results? I DO NOT KNOW,
       but I think it would be worth trying out.

   So in summary I want to see (1) more workshops, invited talks, and
   student posters, (2) Full papers in the proceedings, (3) two-tiered
   program comm. (4) either go to three parallel sessions or have posters.
   Some of these could be combined-- like a workshop on max flows, and
   them posters on the max flow papers that got in. The rebut/rewrite I am
   more ambivalent on but that may also be a good idea. These ideas are
   NOT radical (and not even original) and it is NOT my purpose to drain
   STOC of its prestige. Whether that is a good idea is another debate.

       Reviews of accepted and rejected papers should be publicly
       available in the style of a voting-based discussion board like
       cstheory.stackexchange. Reviews can be made anonymously, good
       reviews get voted up, and bad reviews can be commented on. It is
       such a huge waste of effort that rejected papers get reviewed a
       bunch of times at different venues, and then again for the journal
       submission.

       I don't personally like your idea of posters. Whether or not
       posters should be regarded as inferior to talks, the plain fact is
       that people usually treat them as if they are inferior to talks and
       that is enough to make them a bad idea. The organizers usually
       display the posters in overly cramped conditions that make it hard
       to see the popular posters or the ones next to them due to the
       crowds. Wine and/or refreshments are often served during poster
       sessions, which definitely shows a lack of respect for them. Would
       you consider it appropriate to show your respect for a speaker by
       getting drunk or stuffing your face in the middle of their talk?
       Also, given the availability of this stuff, people often treat
       poster sessions as a time to socialize and chat in general, rather
       than actually looking at the posters.
       Poster sessions are also incredibly tiring for the poster
       presenters, who have to stand up and explain their stuff many times
       over for several hours rather than just doing it once for twenty
       minutes. They are also tiring for the few non presenters who take
       them seriously who have to spend a long time on their feet
       negotiating the crowds to see all the interesting posters. They are
       also discriminatory, in that if you have a disability that makes it
       hard for you to stand for a long time and negotiate crowds then you
       cannot do a poster session either as a presenter or a poster
       viewer. They are also discriminatory because you can't really video
       a poster session like you can with a talk, so you can't really make
       them available to those researchers who cannot attend the
       conference, e.g. due to lack of funds, illness, or looking after
       kids. These discriminatory issues apply to me, so I am strongly
       against poster sessions on these grounds alone.
       Universities have rules and regulations about discrimination that
       they have to follow and they generally have committees to sort out
       just these sort of problems. Conferences are independent entities
       and they generally do not have this sort of oversight. Most of them
       are a mess when it comes to issues of discrimination, because they
       are only ever managed by those researchers who have no trouble
       showing up and negotiating the conference in the first place.

       The NIPS conference does Posters instead of talks--- this is NOT an
       argument for doing it, but it does indicate people we could ask
       about to see how that goes.
       I agree that food should not be served during it.
       If there were posters INSTEAD of talks there would be more time for
       them
       and similar ones would be in the same place, same room.
       That might help the tiredness issues since it wouldn't be hours.
       The Discrimination issue is a good counterargument.

       - I hope the second tier PC will be larger in size and more diverse
       in terms of areas of expertise. Otherwise, consulting with experts
       outside the PC should be encouraged. Last time one of my paper get
       ALL reviews that are clearly from non-expert reviewers (something
       like "I am ok with accepting this paper if an expert in this area
       would say so"). I have heard similar complains from many other
       people. And, please have 3 reviewers for every paper.
       - I think having one round of rebuttal is a good idea. I have
       experienced such a system in some previous conferences and was
       pretty happy with it (even when my papers got rejected).
       - I fully support the poster session. I have previously enjoyed
       poster sessions at STOC, SIGMOD, and VLDB as both a presenter and
       audience. If some people still prefer to have talks, we can even
       have BOTH poster sessions and talks (SIGMOD did this last year and
       I liked it). Of course, this requires more work for the authors's
       side but isn't it worth it given that you have more opportunity to
       advertise your work?

       My take on the ideas:
       Workshops - This has been done before (at least with FOCS), on the
       day before the conference. Not a bad idea, but I don't think that
       more than a day or two would work, as together with the conference
       it would get too long. In particular more invited talks could take
       place inside the workshop day(s).
       Full papers in the proceedings - I'm for it. The only reason not to
       have them was the publishing expense, but now this can be
       electronic only.
       Two tiered PC - A good idea, maybe even a necessity. There are just
       too many submissions.
       Having three parallel sessions is not a good idea, people should
       have a chance to hear more of the talks. Going all-poster is IMHO a
       really bad idea, and a radical one. A poster is in my eyes
       informationally equivalent to a 5-minute lecture, I'll take the
       20-minute lectures. Student and open problem posters are Ok
       (without a "published proceedings" status as some may eventually
       become conference submissions).

            I don't get this comment at all. If the conference is too long
            for you just skip some of the workshops. ALGO in Europe lasts
            an entire week and most people attend only for a subset of
            those days. As simple as that.

       There are a number of reasonable options for the STOC PC structure,
       the 2-tier one among them. I don't see any one structure by itself
       as a panacea. We still are not at the level of SODA's 500+
       submissions or AAAI's 1000+ submissions so there is more
       flexibility. As Joan said, optimizing the PC itself is the lesser
       issue (though there is the radical VLDB "conference as fast
       journal" option also - see below).
       For the conference itself, 3 parallel sessions rather than 2
       parallel sessions would not radically change the atmosphere,
       provided that the conference retains some plenary sessions. SODA
       has done this for a while: In New Orleans it did not have a
       significantly different feeling from STOC (maybe because the number
       of attendees was similar) and there was a good distribution of
       attendees. If venues can accommodate this then it would be vastly
       preferable to extending the time, since extended time runs into
       loss of stamina from attendees and costs more.
       For many years it seems to me that the sweet spot wrt STOC/FOCS has
       been in the 25-30% acceptance range and when they go out of that
       range (particularly going to the low 20-22% range but also when the
       range went significantly above 30%) I have noticed more
       consternation.
       Workshops have been a very positive thing for STOC and FOCS. The
       more that the conference activities can make it a destination than
       merely an anointing of papers, the better.
       I am quite leery of posters as a solution to the paper crowding
       problem. It seems to me that having fewer papers presented makes it
       more a matter of a anointing a very select few for presentation. I
       would rather have it be the case that presented papers are ALSO
       posters so that people get a chance to find out about the talks
       they missed in parallel session.
       One radical option that Joan did not mention is the VLDB-style
       "conference as fast journal" format is being picked up by several
       other conferences. It resolves the problem of PC overload in a
       short 8-10 week stretch by making it a full year occupation (more
       likely half-year for us). For VLDB there are monthly deadlines. The
       same PC operates all year and accepts papers as they come. A paper
       can be sent back for revisions (and returned only once during that
       year). This allows the PC to do more full refereeing. The papers
       are presented at the conference as usual, though they appear in the
       PVLDB journal when they are accepted - even before the conference.
       I can certainly see potential pitfalls - and it may be less good in
       an area like TCS with many thriving journals - but the idea is
       intriguing.

       Chiming in as a NIPS regular.
       -- NIPS papers that are presented as posters have the same
       "prestige" as a conference talk paper in the machine learning
       community. This is probably a cultural thing. I suspect that if
       poster sessions became a regular event at STOC, then there would be
       a cultural shift.
       -- Food/drink are a NECESSITY for poster sessions. There will
       always be a healthy amount of socializing at any poster session.
       It's unclear to what extent having food/drink will create MORE
       socializing that there would be otherwise. But it is clear that a
       lack of food/drink at a poster session leads to a rather miserable
       experience. NIPS 2011 in Granada had very limited amounts of
       food/drink at the poster sessions, which was widely complained
       about.
       -- Regarding whether having food/drink is a sign of lack of respect
       for the poster session, this is the first time such a thought has
       crossed my mind (although perhaps this is because I'm used to
       poster sessions). It could very well be the case that, compared to
       STOCS, it seems like people treat NIPS poster sessions with a
       disdainful lack of respect. But I haven't been bothered by this
       either as a poster peruser or presenter at NIPS.
       -- One distinct advantage of NIPS posters over standard conference
       talks is the personal interaction with the poster presenter. You
       can back up the presenter to clear up confusing points or speed up
       the presentation if you understand the motivation, etc. This can
       often be a very big plus.
       -- Poster sessions are VERY tiring for the presenters. The good
       news is that most papers have multiple co-authors, who can take
       shifts. Even single authors can take sizable breaks during the
       poster session to peruse other posters. It's OK to leave your
       poster un-attended for 20-30 minutes and just have people stare at
       it.

       Maybe it's fair to point out that NIPS is not quite all-poster
       (although it almost is). Besides keynotes and invited talks, a
       small selection of papers are presented in a single track session.
       For our community this will be the equivalent of presenting only
       the papers that are now invited to a special journal issue, and
       moving everything else to posters.
       I agree that this is a strange model that I do not prefer. I do
       like a poster session for ongoing work/work presented in other
       theory venues, etc.

       If we're really serious about comparing PC methods, we should email
       submitters to these conferences after the reviews have been
       returned and ask them to fill out surveys concerning their
       submission experience.
