No, A Severed Finger Will Not Be Able to Access a Stolen iPhone 5S

   The introduction of the [48]iPhone 5S and its easy to use fingerprint
   verification button has suddenly pushed biometric security into the
   mainstream. But for those with a little imagination, there are now
   concerns that smartphone thieves might soon resort to physically
   removing a person's finger in order to gain access to a stolen device.

   More broadly, some of the immediate concerns from the Apple community
   ranged from fears that, based on recent government surveillance
   revelations, the government might now collect all iPhone user
   fingerprints, to the notion that a person's fingerprint might be lifted
   from a surface and used to hack into the device.

   But neither of those concerns -- at least one of which has since been
   [50]dismissed as unfounded -- resonated more than the frightening
   thought of having one's hand physically mutilated in the course of
   being robbed of the new iPhone 5S. In recent years, such fears have
   been driven in part by reports like [51]the one from Malaysia that
   detailed the theft of a biometrically secured Mercedes S-class car that
   resulted in the owner losing a finger so the thieves could start the
   car.

   Now, after the Apple event dust has settled, biometric security experts
   have begun to weigh in and the overall verdict is: Your fingers are
   safe.

   What we now know is that the iPhone's Touch ID fingerprint sensor uses
   radio frequency scanning to detect the sub-epidermal layers of your
   skin, a dynamic that requires the owner of the finger to be alive and
   attached to the finger being used.

   "The [RF capacitive sensor] technology is built in a way that the
   [fingerprint] image has to be taken from a live finger," says Sebastien
   Taveau, chief technology officer at Validity Sensors, a California
   based provider of fingerprint sensor solutions. "No one in biometrics
   wants to talk about cut fingers and dead bodies, but at the end of the
   day we are still asked to remove the fears of consumer and make sure
   that they understand that [a severed finger] will not work."

   Of course, this new feature of the iPhone 5S doesn't rule out instances
   of victims being forced to use their fingers to access the smartphone,
   but it does offer some comfort to those worried about worst-case
   scenarios.

   For long-time observers of Apple this latest development doesn't come
   as much of surprise, as it fits the company's tradition of taking
   existing technology and mainstreaming it through innovation. "[Apple]
   used a technology that's been around for a long time, but the big
   difference is that they made it cool," says Taveau. "It's been around
   on laptops, but besides locking and unlocking your laptop there was not
   much of a use case for it.

   "Now with Apple, by actually building an experience, they are educating
   the market, which is very important... Expect to see the Android world
   shipping [these kinds of] devices in the next couple of months."
