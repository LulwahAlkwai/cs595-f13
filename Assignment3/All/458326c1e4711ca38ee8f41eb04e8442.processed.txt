Women who don't self-promote are letting us down.

   Maggie Fox, June 26 2013

   I don't care how distasteful you find it. Or, perhaps it's not even
   modesty, but rather a feeling that giving that interview or speaking at
   that conference is not a good use of your time. You're too busy.
   Whatever the reason, I'll make this very clear: women who want to
   [20]"change the ratio" but don't self promote are letting all of us
   down.

   I'm publishing this post (in which no names shall be named) in response
   to my recent experience on a writing project. I'm interviewing amazing
   founders and CEOs, talking to them about their businesses and how they
   got there. I am committed to ensuring that the voices that make up this
   story are diverse - I'd like to have a decent ratio of women to men
   (50/50 is probably ambitious, but I'll try). Thanks to introductions
   from well-connected and helpful friends, I've interviewed some of the
   best-known names in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, and their stories
   have been amazing, compelling, and strikingly humble.

   The problem? Most of them are men. Why? Because less than a third of
   the women I've approached have responded or agreed to be interviewed.
   All of the men have.

   At this rate, I'll have to approach three female tech CEOs for every
   single interview I'm able to book. I invite you to pity me in my
   attempts to "change the ratio" - something that now appears to be a
   mathematical impossibility.

   So I'll just say it: women who don't self promote are letting us down.
   This isn't going to happen by magic - this is your responsibility.

   Maggie, I couldn't agree more. As someone who speaks on panels and also
   organizes a fair number of them, it is clear that the ratio most
   definitely needs to be changed. I've horrified even myself when I've
   set up an all male panel, but, you know what, that's because they are
   the ones being served up by companies to speak. I am not going to tell
   a company who should speak, nor mandate the sex of the speaker. I just
   want the best voice on a given topic. If women do not step up and let
   it be known that they can and want to represent their companies as
   speakers, changing the ratio is most definitely a 'mathematical
   impossibility.' Good luck with your project.
   [24]Maggie Fox on [25]August 12th, 2013
   Thanks very much for your thoughtful comment, Susan. Ensuring diversity
   of voices is definitely a collective responsibility!
   Heather MacLean on [26]August 12th, 2013
   Great post and yes, we need to change the ratio. The interesting
   challenge that we still encounter is doing self promotion well. Like it
   or not, women still have to approach this differently than men. We not
   only need to change the ratio, but we need to change an entire culture.
   Sadly enough I still hear conversations that are less than positive
   about women who do self promote. What bothers me most is that a lot of
   this comes from women. We need to support one another in this effort.
   Jan Ryan on [27]August 13th, 2013
   This is an important topic. Especially in changing the ratios for
   entrepreneurs, a passion of mine. It's not just the ratios we need to
   change but the narrative as well. Entrepreneur does not = male, but if
   you look at what you see in the press and even on photos within
   accelerators, etc, you would think so. This next generation of women
   leaders need to see more examples, role models, stories, high fives
   around women -- they need to see themselves inside these stories and
   say "Hey I can do that!" Love your article, Maggie, keep the
   conversation going. :-)
   [28]maggiefox | Social Media Group on [29]August 14th, 2013
   Thanks, Jan & Heather!
   anonymousCEO on [30]August 16th, 2013
   People who are asking women to self-promote are ignoring that often,
   women who self-promote are viewed less favorably -- FAR less favorably
   -- than men who self-promote. Some people who are running businesses
   may have time to deal with you, but not with the haters, "LOL I'd hit
   that!" trolls, and (occasionally) long analyses of their clothes, hair,
   body, sexual orientation .... the list goes on and on.
   [31]Jacqui Cooper on [32]August 18th, 2013
   AnonymousCEO you may be right but that doesn't mean that women should
   give in. Maggie Thatcher, Hilary Clinton and Oprah didn't worry about
   how others reacted to their self promotion. If we, as women, allow the
   perceptions/biases of others to stop us, we allow them to control us. I
   hope you get your 50/50% Maggie. Maybe you should let us know who you
   want to speak to and we can all reach out via Twitter etc to ask them
   to agree?
   [33]Maggie Fox on [34]August 19th, 2013
   @AnonymousCEO has a point, and it's very valid (also part of the reason
   women don't negotiate - they're viewed less favorably when they do),
   but I think @Jacqui nails it - to succumb to that fear is to allow it
   to control you. If we're going to change things, we have to plow
   through, because "haters gonna hate" no matter what you do. And thanks
   also for the offer, Jacqui, but I also don't want to unduly embarrass
   anyone; that doesn't do us any good, either ;-)
   [35]Layla on [36]August 21st, 2013
   Hi Maggie: I was just thinking today whether I am being 'bad' for
   accepting to speak at a few upcoming conferences and volunteering
   myself for a Radio show, and your article really helped me decide!
   Thanks so much!
   Glen on [37]August 26th, 2013
   Maggie, If you have not yet contacted her, you should reach out to
   Trish Costello. She is the former head of Babson College's
   Entrepreneurship program, President of the Kaufmann Foundation, and is
   s strong voice for women's empowerment. She is in the process of
   kicking off a new venture here in Silicon Valley largely directed to
   women, and, I suspect, would be happy to participate.
   [38]Maggie Fox on [39]September 2nd, 2013
   @Glen - thank you for the tip, I"ll definitely look into that. And
   Layla - so glad to hear it. Ignore those voices! Put yourself out
   there!
   lost faith on [40]September 10th, 2013
   Just want to add that after 20 years in business culture, I've found
   that offering a different position then any men in a meeting or
   questioning them directly has labeled me "a bitch". If a man pointed
   out the very things I pointed out, they would be put in charge of said
   issue. I have instead been uninvited to meetings by a female boss
   uncomfortable with disagreement. However, this is in the Gov, I imagine
   on the private side I would at least be thanked for avoiding
   unnecessary expense or system failures. This culture of expecting
   submission and good (i.e different) behavior from women then from men
   is the root of all the items listed above about not wanting to stand
   out as a target... I am hoping the younger generation can call this
   crap out for what it is (the men and the women), but I'm not sure how
   without encountering the very problem I've stated.
   [41]JBStudios on [42]October 3rd, 2013
   This is an extremely complex issue- One that cannot be simplistically
   explained by "Women just refuse to be interviewed..."! It is permeated
   in our society and I wish I knew how to overcome it. Each of the
   previous comments identifies a very real aspect of the issue. I am
   still trying to figure it out. I "forget" sometimes that I am a woman
   and when I speak directly and passionately about a solution to a
   problem in a meeting led by traditional men. I can see a clear
   discomfort with my behavior. I have well conceived and presented ideas,
   but somehow the only result is that after the meeting, these "leaders"
   make light of my delivery and tease me. This is extremely frustrating.
   Perhaps it's because I am in a non-confrontational field (secondary
   education) so they don't expect meaningful discussion, but sadly I have
   realized that these "leaders" aren't interested in problem solving.
   Twice in my life I was been given by male superiors reasons why I
   received a lower grade, or reasons why the newcomer was being paid more
   than I- both times the answer was "because they are men". I wish I knew
   how some women are able to overcome this. I do believe women need to
   support one another, though. That would help.
   [43]JBStudios on [44]October 3rd, 2013
   Pls.forgive typo: "...Have been given..."
