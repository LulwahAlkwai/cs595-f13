[4]Fast integer compression in Java

   Last year, we published [5]a fast C++ library to quickly compress and
   decompress arrays of integers. To get good compression, we use
   differential coding: the arrays of integers are sorted and instead of
   storing the integers themselves, we store the difference between
   successive integers. The differences are typically small integers that
   can be compressed efficiently. Out of habit, I [6]ported our code to
   Java and published it under the name [7]JavaFastPFOR library.

   Unlike generic compression techniques like gzip or Google Snappy, we
   only wish to compress and uncompress integers. We provide a less
   general solution, but we can also get much more impressive speeds in
   some cases (e.g., an order of magnitude faster).

   Though you cannot reach the same kind of speed in Java as you can in
   C++, there are many good reasons to use Java instead of C++. How good
   is Java at this task? Direct comparisons between Java and C++ are
   difficult. I would estimate that the difference is a factor of 3 and
   more. But Java can still be more than fast enough.

   I decided to compare our results with the popular Kamikaze PForDelta
   library. I used a fast core i7 processor with synthetic data. We vary
   the compressibility of the data. For each test, I report the speed in
   millions of integers per second as well as the storage cost in bits per
   integer (in parenthesis).
    Binary Packing   Kamikaze PForDelta
   1200 (3.1)       300 (3.3)
   1100 (7.4)       300 (7.7)
   1000 (13)        300 (14)

   The numbers show that the Binary Packing technique implemented in the
   [8]JavaFastPFOR library can easily exceed 1 billion of integers per
   second in decompression speed. This is likely fast enough for most
   applications.

   I posted the [9]raw results if you wish the examine them more closely.

   The library is available under the Apache license and is part of the
   Maven repository. It includes many more schemes.

   Warning: These results may not be representative of what you get in an
   actual application. They will vary depending on the machine you use and
   your data. I am only providing these numbers as a ballpark indication.

   Credit: This work is the result of a fruitful collaboration with many
   super smart people including L. Boytsov, O. Kaser, N. Kurz. All
   mistakes are my fault.

    1. "The assumption is that most (but not all) values in your array use
       less than 32 bits."
       I think this statement belongs in this post, otherwise nothing
       makes sense.

    2. I was recently contemplating on whether I should use Java for
       algorithmic programming and I came to a conclusion. Java is not
       good. I mean it is great if you consider the number of libraries
       available. The performance is generally good. Yet, if you need
       top-notch performance, it is quite hard to get in Java. You would
       need to use awful things like manual memory management and parallel
       arrays.... This is awful and counterproductive. You can do much
       better in C++. But, if you don't mind 2-3x loss in performance Java
       (Scala, or, say, OCaml) can be a nice choice.

       Thanks for pointing out a shortcoming in my post. However, we do
       not make this assumption. Instead, we just assume that the integers
       have been sorted. I have edited the post accordingly.

       What is true is that there is a whole range of optimizations that
       are simply not possible in Java (by design).

    5. Does it support streaming compression as integers keep appearing in
       the stream?

       You can compress and uncompress data in blocks... See the
       "advanced" example in the example.java file:
       [24]https://github.com/lemire/JavaFastPFOR/blob/master/example.java
       So, yes, I would say that you can building streaming applications
       using this library.
