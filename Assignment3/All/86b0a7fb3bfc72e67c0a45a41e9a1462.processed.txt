   Is it possible to make a living as a genre fiction writer? Yes it is.

[8]Obsolete Anonymous

   Moderator: Welcome to Obsolete Anonymous! I've gathered you all here to
   welcome our latest member, the Print Industry.
   Print Industry: Hello, everyone. But there's been a mistake. I don't
   belong here.
   (chuckles all around)
   Print Industry: I'm serious. I'm not obsolete. I'm relevant. Print
   books have been around for hundreds of years. They're never going to be
   replaced.
   VHS Tapes: Yeah, we all thought like that once.
   LP Records: It's called denial. It's tough to deal with at first.
   VHS tapes: Easy for you to say, LP. You've still got a niche collector
   market. They can't even give me away on eBay.
   Antique Stores: Can we please not mention eBay? I used to have stores
   all over. But more and more keep closing thanks to that
   good-for-nothing website.
   CDs: At least you still have some stores left. The specialty stores
   that sell me are almost extinct. I'm down to a few narrow isles at Best
   Buy and Wal-Mart.
   Print Industry: Look, everyone, I assume you all think that ebooks are
   going to put me out of business. But that won't happen.
   Ma Bell: We all deny it at first. I remember when you couldn't walk
   twenty yards in a city without seeing a pay phone. Then those gosh darn
   cell phones came along. Do you know some people don't even have land
   lines anymore? Used to be a land line in every home...
   (Ma Bell begins to cry. Print Phonebooks joins in. So does Dial Up
   Modems. Encyclopedia Britannica, wearing an I Hate Wikipedia T-Shirt,
   pops a few Prozac. A group hug ensues.)
   Video Rental Store: What Ma Bell is trying to say is that when a
   technology comes along that's faster, easier, and cheaper, the old
   technology--and all the companies that supported it--tends to fade
   away.
   Print Industry: Why are you here, Video Rental Store? There are still
   Blockbuster Videos everywhere.
   CDs: There were record stores everywhere once.
   Cassette Tapes: Hell yeah! They sold cassettes, too! Someone give me a
   high five!
   (no one gives Cassette Tapes a high five)
   Video Rental Store: Things looked good for a while. I had a decent,
   twenty-year run. Then I got hit by all sides. Netflix, shipping DVDs
   though the mail. On Demand. Tivo. YouTube. But the nail in the coffin
   came in the past two years. Hula. Roku--which allows Netflix
   subscribers to stream video instantly. iTunes and Amazon offering movie
   downloads. Red Box, which rents DVDs for 99 cents and takes up no more
   space than a Coke machine...
   Print Industry: But ebooks are just a tiny percentage of the market.
   People have been reading print since Gutenberg. They won't adapt to
   change that easily.
   Kodak: You're correct. It takes a few years for people to fully embrace
   new technology. Some never do. Polaroid never replaced me.
   Polaroid: Shut up, Kodak. We both got our asses kicked by digital. When
   was the last time you sold any 110 film?
   TV Antennas: I'm still big in some third world countries!
   Typewriter: The bottom line is: when technology improves, it becomes
   widely adopted. Me and Carbon Paper used to have a groovy thing going.
   I'd make the words, he would make the copies. Then Xerox got into the
   act, but he's not doing well now either.
   Xerox: F*cking computers.
   Floppy Disc: You said it!
   Dot Matrix: F*cking laser and inkjet. Doesn't anyone else miss tearing
   off the perforated hole punches on the side of paper? Don't they miss
   the feel and smell of that?
   Fold-Out Paper Maps: I agree! Isn't it fun to open up a big map while
   you're driving, in hopes of figuring out where you are? Don't you miss
   the old days before cars came equipped with GPS and no one ever used
   that bastard, MapQuest?
   CDs: F*cking internet. That's the problem. Instant access to
   information and entertainment for the whole world. You guys want to
   talk about pirating and illegal downloads?
   (everyone shouts out a collective no!)
   Moderator: We all read on JA Konrath's blog that the way to fight
   piracy is with cost and convenience. Print Industry, are you lowering
   your prices and making it easier for customers to download your books?
   Print Industry: Actually, we just raised prices on our ebooks.
   (collective sighs and head shaking)
   Moderator: Well, far be it for you to learn from any of our mistakes.
   Are you making it easier at least?
   Print Industry: Well, we've begun windowing titles, releasing them
   months after the hardcover comes out.
   (collective head slapping)
   Music Industry: Have you at least tried selling from your own site? I
   wish I'd done that. But that upstart Apple came along...
   Print Industry: Uh... no. We haven't tried that. In fact, some
   ebooks--we'll use JA Konrath as an example since he was
   mentioned--aren't even available on all platforms and in all
   territories.
   Moderator: What do you mean? Konrath's ebooks are available all over
   the place.
   Print Industry: Those are the ones he uploads himself. The ones of his
   that we sell are missing from several key markets, and have been for
   years. But it's okay. We're paying him much smaller royalties and
   jacking the prices up high so we can still make a profit. Besides,
   ebooks are a niche market. Ereading devices are dedicated and
   expensive.
   Arcades: I used to be a thriving industry. Kids spent billions of
   quarters in my thousands of locations. But then Nintendo, Sony, and
   Microsoft made home arcade machines, and now people play their
   videogames on dedicated devices. It's a multi-billion dollar business
   now, and I can only compete if I sell shitty pizza and give out plastic
   trinkets to kids with the most foosball tickets. If people want the
   media, they buy the expensive device. Period.
   Print Industry: None of you are listening to me. Print will always be
   around.
   Newspaper Industry: Yeah! What he said!
   Print Industry: Let's not compare ourselves, okay Newspaper Industry?
   No offense.
   Newspaper Industry: None taken. Hey, maybe we can help each other. I'm
   selling advertising space for dirt cheap these days, and...
   Print Industry: No thanks. No one reads you anymore. People get their
   news elsewhere.
   Moderator: So why won't people get their novels elsewhere as well?
   (Print Industry stands up, pointing a finger around the room.)
   Print Industry: Look, this isn't about me. All of you guys have become
   irrelevant. Technology marched on, and you didn't march with it. But
   that WILL NOT happen to me. There will always be bookstores, and dead
   tree books. We'll continue to sell hardcovers at luxury prices, and pay
   artists 6% to 15% royalties on whatever list price WE deem appropriate.
   And the masses will buy our books BECAUSE WE SAID SO! WE SHALL NEVER
   BECOME OBSOLETE!!!
   Buggy Whip Industry: Amen, brother! That's what I keep trying to tell
   these people!
   CDs: (whispering to LPs) I give him six years, tops.
   -------------
   Joe sez: I wrote the above three years ago. So what has changed since
   then?
   Every video rental store in my area has disappeared. Blockbuster Video
   filed for bankruptcy and now has 500 stores left in the US. They once
   had 9000.
   Kodak filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. In 2010, you could still buy 35mm
   film everywhere. Now you can't.
   One of the two major bookstore chains, Borders, has closed.
   The last commercially produced typewriter was donated to a museum.
   The US has almost entirely switched to digital TV.
   Roku supported Netflix streaming video. Now Netflix comes preinstalled
   on new TVs, Blu Ray players, Wiis, Xboxs, Playstations, 3DS, Vistas, WD
   Live, and Apple TV. It can be installed on the iPad, Kindle Fire, and
   Nook. Amazon also streams video, free to Prime members.
   Since getting my rights back, my income from those titles has gone up
   over 1000%.
   The print industry still hasn't raised author royalties. They faced a
   DOJ lawsuit for price fixing, allegedly keeping ebook prices high, and
   have settled. Paper sales continue to decline, while ebook sales
   continue to rise.
   The buggy whip industry still hasn't recovered.

          I love my ereader and my ebooks, I love being able to store all
          sorts of info in a slim little slice of a computer on my desk.
          But I also know that as long as there exists the possibility of
          prolonged power outages and 'net downtime, there's still a
          market for some things in paper.
          Enjoyment reading? May not so much. Reference materials? Yeah,
          definitely.
          And I don't say this just because I work in the printing
          industry (by the way, print is more than just the publishing
          industry), but more because I realized just how far up that
          proverbial creek so many would be if something catastrophic did
          happen and we had to survive without all these wonderful tools
          and toys we've become so dependent on. You know, as I was
          reading Anne of Green Gables on my Kindle.

          There are still a massive amount of authors living in the dream
          world where money & fame are right around the corner with some
          6-figure+ deal from print publishers.
          They hold onto that dream the way Scrooge McDuck holds onto
          money (or Mr. Crabs for those of you born yesterday).
          They can't move past the idea that you can make tons more money
          on your own. Authors I know who are chasing the print dream are
          still telling me that self-published books only sell a few dozen
          copies -- and when I point out my sales figures and/or the
          amount of money I'm making (often 5x per year what some
          publishers offer as an advance) they say that I that one in a
          million who has caught lightning in a bottle and I'm the
          exception.
          I'm not an exception. I don't even sell that much. I'm never in
          the Top 100 overall on the Kindle and I still make about 5x per
          book what publishers like Angry Robot give as an advance.
          You can lead that horse to water, but you can't make him think.

          That is just plain hilarious. And totally true. God I love the
          truth.
          That said, it does seem print books will hold on for while, and
          even as more than just a niche market. People like the feel of
          paper and the feeling of ownership that dead trees provide. I
          know I do. Books I want to read and forget are fine "rented"
          from the e-providers. Books I want to cherish and re-read and
          use for reference, and pass on to others when I croak, well,
          those I'll probably still purchase in physical form, so long as
          they are available.
          Thanks, Joe, for all your insights and entertainment. Damn fine
          post and blog in general.

          I was curious about my comments from three years ago, so I
          scrolled through the 2010 archives until I found the
          [31]original post.
          Here's what I said back then:
          Funny!
          Of course, so is the story of Chicken Little. ;)
          I would like to have a Kindle, and I probably will buy one
          eventually.
          But I probably won't take it to the beach, like I did my print
          book today, where it's likely to get sand and suntan lotion all
          over it and where its delicate little microchips will be exposed
          to blistering heat all day; I probably won't put it in my
          backpack and take it to work to read during lunch, for fear that
          it might get stolen; I probably won't relax in the tub with it,
          for fear it might get wet (and I'm NOT reading through a
          friggin' Ziploc bag!); I probably won't...
          I think you get the picture.
          Unlike all the other media you mentioned, there are actually
          advantages to ink on paper. Printed books will live on beside
          their electronic counterparts in perpetuity, IMO.
          Was I wrong?
          Let me just put it this way: I received a Kindle for Christmas
          that year, and I haven't bought more than a handful of paper
          books since.

          The print *industry* may be around for awhile yet, but not in
          its present form. Lots of layoffs and mergers in the future
          before finally settling down into their eventual niche remnants.

          I can't think of anything more depressing than a world where
          paper books are entirely replaced by self-published eBooks...
          Jesus. Yeah, so downloads have decimated CD sales, but that's
          because listening to an album on an mp3 player is exactly the
          same experience as listening to it on a Discman, with added
          convenience. A Kindle is convenient, and remarkably usable, but
          it will never give you the exact same experience as reading a
          physical book.

          I agree. The Kindle experience is so much better.
          Since uploading my backlist, I've had some folks tell me there
          are some formatting errors. So my gracious wife is re-reading
          the Jack Daniels series on paper, earmarking the errors.
          She hates it. The kindle is just so much easier to hold, to use,
          to find your place. Backlit and font size adjustable so no need
          for reading glasses.
          I just was rereading my dog-eared copy of On Writing by Stephen
          King. Got through the first chapter, then rebought it on Kindle
          because the hardcover was too big and bulky.
          Paper will never go away. But it will, for most purposes, be
          replaced.

          @Gavin Bell - in many ways an ebook reader gives a better
          experience than a traditional book; especially if the book is
          heavy to hold or has very small print.

          While e-books have certainly exploded onto the scene and
          captured a sizeable market share (something around 30% last I
          heard), the initial growth has shown signs of leveling off.
          While big changes may well be in store twenty years down the
          road (think about what computers were like 20 years ago . . .
          egads!), I'm not so sure that there will be all that much change
          over the next six years. I certainly don't think the publishing
          industry will be folding, and I think print books will continue
          to have at least a majority of all trade sales for quite some
          time. It's entirely possible I'll need to eat these words (it
          wouldn't be the first time), but that's how I see things going
          right now.

          Changing the subject a bit, but Joe is always telling us to keep
          writing, that hard work can lead to good luck, to get as many
          fantastic books as you can out there. Joe has over 50 titles
          now. More power to him. This Salon article shows how having a
          book near the top for a short time (#6 for a week or two) is
          nice and ego-inflating, but it usually won't buy you that island
          in the Caribbean. It might get you a few weeks at the beach
          though.

          Gavin Bell: vinyl fans would probably like to disagree with you.
          The reality is that there's only a small group of people that
          reads books for the "book experience" (similar to the vinyl
          niche), whereas the majority of people uses them as a tool to
          convey information or culture. To them, the format is not
          terribly relevant, as long as it's usable.

          About the 'Book experience'. I paid $1 (at a $1 store for a
          Phillips Ereader cover in what I'm guessing is Faux leather. It
          looks and feels startling similar to some of the small 18th and
          19th century books I have on my shelf. It has a small elastic
          strap across the back that I can fit my hand through, and the
          'Reading Experience' is incredible. I can read from my complete
          works of Shakespeare or a eMagazine with equal comfort and ease.
          The 'Book Experience' has too often meant cramped hands or
          fingers, unwieldy books, bad bindings, impossible to read
          paperbacks without breaking the spine so they will open flat,
          etc... Try reading a 700 page paperback that doesn't turn into
          an accordion or have the pages fall out...
          No, kindle and other eReaders are here, and the printed book is
          a sign of the past.

          Print isn't dead, but the print *industry* is changing for sure.
          Children's books or textbooks heavy with illustrations and
          graphs still work better in print. And children's books aren't
          as ephemeral as popular novels. Not only do you read them over
          and over again, there is a sentimental attachment to the better
          ones.
          That said, I sure wish I could have read Stephen King's UNDER
          THE DOME in ebook format, because that huge mother f-ing trade
          paperback was a pain in the wrists. But I got it for an Xmas
          gift. And now that I think about it, gifting is another area
          where print is superior. It's just no fun unwrapping a digital
          file. :)
          Also, any thoughts on POD technology? I think that could keep
          print going a while longer, as it eliminates a lot of costs and
          overhead trad publishers still seem to want to pay.

          Pardon me if I sound rude, but I get the distinct feeling that
          you are unfamiliar with the vinyl renaissance in independent
          music and its continuing popularity in the field of electronica.
          I also sense that you are deliberately avoiding the topic of
          small press publishing for the purposes of simplicity or
          polemic--I am not sure exactly which. Either way, as a supporter
          of all of the above, I feel that you have misrepresented these
          industries and it annoys me quite a bit.

          That's niche, not mainstream. Vinyl is in no position to replace
          digital. The fact that it still exists is quaint, and it's nice
          to see current artists issuing new vinyl (which they do with the
          digital files included in the purchase price). I predicted back
          in 2007 that ebooks would be bundled with print. We still
          haven't seen that with regularity, but some publishers are
          experimenting with it.
          The point of the skit was (and still is) that new tech phases
          out old tech.
          I use createspace for paper versions of my novels, and since
          2009 have made over $40k selling print. Vs. over a million
          selling ebooks. Pretty obvious which is outselling which.
          I feel that you have misrepresented these industries and it
          annoys me quite a bit.
          Then, by all means, instead of using the Internet to state this,
          perhaps you should tell me and the whole world via telegraph.

          Watch a small child play with an iPad or Kindle Fire.
          Illustrations work fine with tablets, and kids love them.
          And graphs can be manipulated with digital. Tap the screen and
          bring up multiple ways to interpret the same data.
          As for sentiment, the story is in our heads, not on the page.
          Search my blog for "destination value."
          As for POD, I use it to publish. But I don't buy it. I haven't
          bought a paper book in a long time, as opposed to hundreds of
          digital books. If I could get all of the my paper books
          converted to digital, I'd get rid of them all. I also Comic Zeal
          to read my old Famous Monsters and Fangorias. Pinch and zoom
          works great with pdf files of picture-rich mags, and I don't
          miss the mildew smell.

          Sorry. Too late. Cassette tapes were dropped off at the local
          thrift shop, who stated they don't sell, so they went into the
          recycle bin.
          But you can high five paper books. For the moment.

          Watch a small child play with an iPad or Kindle Fire.
          Illustrations work fine with tablets, and kids love them.
          Yeah, my kids dig the tablet. But the lurv their print books a
          lot, too.
          Now, their kids will probably visit the print books in the
          museum.
          I don't disagree that ebooks will replace print eventually. But
          I don't think the timeline on that is as short as you suggest.
          It's a little early to send DTBs to OA meetings.

          Fabulous. Went back and looked at the 2010 responses (thanks
          Jude) and saw some great comments. Someone pointed out that
          ebooks were only 6% of the market... THEN.
          It's not a pbook/ebook dichotomy. I read both, but there are so
          many advantages to e, for me.
          As to those who say you can't make a living as a self-publisher
          -- I uploaded a new 99¢ short yesterday and am selling 100 a
          day. Already. At that rate, four such stories, plus the ebook
          that puts them all together, will make a reasonable living.
          Thanks for what you do, Joe.

          I also sense that you are deliberately avoiding the topic of
          small press publishing for the purposes of simplicity or
          polemic--I am not sure exactly which.
          Are there still small presses that don't publish ebooks? If
          there are, they would be wise to get with the program.
          Otherwise, they won't be small anymore. They'll be gone.

          The gig was up and he had to admit to himself that there was a

          From the article on Brother:
          The company said that it still had significant sales in the U.S.
          - where government departments and some offices still use them -
          but Brother's factory in the Far East produces enough
          typewriters to serve this market.
          So they're still in production, just not in Britain.

          Then, by all means, instead of using the Internet to state this,
          perhaps you should tell me and the whole world via telegraph.
          You really don't seem to get where I'm coming from here. I'm not
          saying that vinyl should replace digital, nor that it should,
          but that it is not truly obsolete--it has been replaced as the
          primary mode of conveying its medium, not totally eliminated by
          superior competition. The Betamax and the 8-track are obsolete,
          as are the Gutenberg press and the buttonhook. Vinyl is not.
          "Small-scale" does not equate to "irrelevant." As a
          self-publisher, you should know that.
          But that's not really my point here, or even my issue with the
          article. It's that you're painting in incredibly broad strokes
          without acknowledging that people who disagree with you either
          have a point or have a right to feel that way. Again, the devil
          is in the details.

          P.S. If you really want "niche," cassette culture is still a
          thing among noise and DIY enthusiasts, as strange as that
          sounds. It makes sense: Cassette has a very particular sound to
          it that works well with some music. But still, it's an odd
          thing.

   [125]Joe Konrath said...
          It's that you're painting in incredibly broad strokes
          It's satire, my friend. That tends to be broad.
          If you'd like to discuss minutiae, I'm fine with that. But the
          point of the piece was to show that clinging to outdated tech is
          silly.
          A niche market doesn't stop technology from moving forward and
          taking industries with it. Vinyl doesn't need to be obliterated
          by digital. Neither do paper books. But once the scale tips to
          favor a new tech, it doesn't tip back.
          I'm not arguing that vinyl is irrelevant, only that it is
          obsolete. And for mainstream music listeners--the vast
          majority--it is. Vinyl records once supported a vast industry.
          It no longer does that. Digital has replaced it. The amount of
          vinyl being sold pales compared to the digital music being sold
          on iTunes.
          have a right to feel that way.
          You have a right to feel however you want to feel. Everyone is
          entitled to an opinion, and all opinions are valid. How am I
          preventing that right?
          the devil is in the details.
          Sometimes. If those details invalidate the main point.In this
          case, the main point is that history shows us industry misses
          out on tech revolutions. Having a niche market of vinyl in no
          way invalidates my point. Neither does the fact that Brother
          still makes typewriters in the US. I got that detail wrong, but
          it doesn't mean my conclusions are.
          I'll revisit this again in three years, see how the big
          publishers are doing. My advice: don't buy stock in publishing.

          would be writers who dream of getting a big six deal come to our

          of gold which will leave less for us. If they want to stay in La

          Loved this, made me laugh aloud. I think of the 15th century
          writer who kept taking his book to the local monastery and had
          to leave empty-handed because they refused to copy it. In high
          dudgeon he was forced to go down the road and ask Mr Caxton to
          print it. 'It's not as good as the real thing,' the monks said.
          'Nobody will value something which can be produced in hours
          instead of months.'
          'But readers are buying my books in their thousands,' the writer
          said.
          The monks looked amused. 'Readers! What do they know about
          books?'

          Great article, I enjoyed reading it very much. I know in my
          little world, print versions of my books are in the single
          digits every month and there are plenty of months when I don't
          sell a single one while their ebook siblings are selling quite
          well.
          Paper books will be in libraries and used bookstores and that's
          about it. When? Sooner than you think.
          I think we'll always buy paper books but it will be strictly
          POD. Big companies like Amazon will get the experience as close
          to ebook as possible: customer clicks buy and the book is
          printed on demand and shipped that day overnight for as cheaply
          as possible. Perhaps Redbox-type print on demand kiosks at
          stores.
          Either way, mass printing of books shipped all over the world to
          stores will no longer exist.

          I do see the day when printed books become a niche market, much
          like vinyl records. Just look at the kids of today who do
          virtually everything on their phones. It won't happen overnight,
          but I would not be surprised if printed books are a small
          percentage of the market in 10-15 years.

          To show how quickly times change, those Nintendo, Sony, and

          They are quickly being eclipsed by people playing games on their

          very good job adapting. Just take a look at the reviews of the

          Comparing the latest Nintendo products, like the Wii, to

          for a long time because they don't know how to make something
          people actually want to play.
          Until you can make a phone with the same processing power as a
          game console (which will be a while, as the consoles always get
          replaced with new, more powerful models) I don't think they have
          to worry about people playing Angry Birds instead of Gears of

          Here's one I did in 2007 that's eerily prescient.
          [191]http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/2007/01/my-speech-at-google.h
          tml
          I was speaking to a group of publishers. Here's an intriguing
          bit:
          An entire generation is learning how to read by using computers.
          More and more people are getting their information and
          entertainment on the web. And they aren't being passive about
          it--they're seeking it out.
          On the subway today, I counted 7 people with PDAs, Blackberrys,
          and Palms, and two more with mp3 players. People need their
          media so much they're taking it with them when they leave their
          desks. Only three people on that train were reading newspapers.
          What does that say about the future of print media?
          People read online all the time. It's up to the publishers to
          teach them how to read books online.
          There's no reason why books can't be packaged with a CD. It
          could contain various downloadable text AND audio formats, so
          people can read it on their PDA or listen to it on their mp3
          player...
          Do you want people to embrace ebooks? (You should--no shipping,
          no returns, no printing, no distributor, no waste, higher profit
          margin.) Then package 20 Stephen King books on a Sandisk card
          for $40. Steve gets the 60 cent per book royalty he would have
          gotten from a paperback sale, and the buyer changes his reading
          habits.
          Of course, it wasn't publishers who taught people how to read
          digitally. It was Amazon, who released the Kindle ten months

          If Joe is right and progress and obsolescence is inevitable,
          then why stop at print books?
          What will happen to authors? I've been amused to see some indie
          authors argue that some kind of filter will need to reinstated
          if good books are to be noticed. Anyone can write and publish a
          book at the moment and the market is flooded, making it
          difficult for 'good' authors (a self-proclaimed term no doubt)
          to get noticed and make a living. After all they are competing
          with writers who can churn out words at a rate of 10,000 a day.
          They can write, and now publish, half a dozen books in the time
          it used to take an author to produce just one.
          That's tough.
          But maybe technology has the answer. If the quality of a book is
          no longer an issue (it is a moot point anyway) then why not
          employ a computer to write fiction?
          Most popular fiction is formulaic. Detective with alcohol
          issues, solves crime of the day with the assistance of a good
          woman etc.
          Luckily for the publishing industry help is on hand. Computers
          are now being used to replace journalists, especially when it
          comes to writing data heavy pieces.
          How long will it be before these same computers can learn to
          write a detective story or a piece of chick lit? Not long if Joe
          is to be believed.

          Your argument depends on quality not being important, but that's
          just not the case. For the most part, the cream rises to the
          top, and the crap sinks to oblivion. That's the way it has
          always been, and that's the way it always will be.

          "Your argument depends on quality not being important, but
          that's just not the case. For the most part, the cream rises to
          the top, and the crap sinks to oblivion."
          Your caveat "for the most part" is important. There are many
          aspects to a book that can make it popular. 50 Shades of Grey is
          an interesting example.
          Books promoted on television or adaptations of series and movies
          also do well. And it's not worthwhile judging the literary
          merits of the latest diet, health or therapy book.
          Looking at the current bestseller list at Amazon it's not
          impossible to imagine that, one day, well programmed software
          could turn out facsimiles of many of them.

          Just as we waste energy mourning the loss of one technology to

          I think Joe's point in all of this is to live in the now. And

          As the owner of a VHS collection of 28 animated Disney movie
          Hi, Susan!
          (I know people call you Susan all the time because of your first
          book. :P)
          I had about $5k in VHS, including every Disney Classic.
          Then I got a 60" hi-def flatscreeen, and VHS looked awful. So I
          bought everything again in DVD.
          Now Blu-ray is reigning. But I'll be honest--I don't see the big
          dif between DVD and Blu-ray. Perhaps because, after lasix,
          everything only gets so clear.
          So I buy in Blu-ray as things are released, but don't upgrade my
          older DVDs unless they aren't anamorphic or 5.1.
          Point being: get rid of the media you no longer use.

          So important that I disagree.
          Sometimes cream rises to the top.
          But what sells is what is visible. Sometimes quality can make
          something visible. Sometimes quality needs a boost.
          I await the day when computers AI can make people laugh. That
          will be the turning point. Not regurgitating old jokes, but
          understanding humor enough to invent jokes, consistently.
          In fact, let's call that Konrath's Law.
          "True IA is the ability for a computer to consistently
          understand humor and be able to make people laugh. To hell with

          I'm waiting for the Book Pill. Swallow it, and the story plays

          Every mind-altering substance I've tried (and I've tried lots of
          them) depends on my own imagination.
          I want a mind-altering substance that makes me experience

          Human beings, who understand love, hate, sexuality and humor,
          already are. En-masse, in many cases.
          But look at the actual profit from even the highest selling
          books, versus say, the profits for a single year from a
          Microsoft or an Oracle. And then using actual, honest to god AI
          for novel writing (instead of other application) seems kind of
          redundant from the business standpoint.
          Maybe even a little bit silly.

          Joe made a good point about humor. And there are so many other
          facets to the human mind, all working in concert with each other
          to create something as emotionally complex as a novel, that I
          don't believe a computer could ever come close to replicating
          that experience for the reader. A computer will never have a
          "voice," IMO. Computers won't write novels; they'll write
          novelties.
          And that'll be great. Then I can advertise my work as 100% HUMAN

          You have to be visible, but you also have to have a book that
          people want to read. I disagree with your dog theory, that
          people will indiscriminately devour whatever you put in front of
          them. If that was the case, then every new TV show would be a
          big hit.
          Everyone who was alive in 1983 remembers a show called Manimal
          because of all the promo it got. Unfortunately, the show only
          lasted for seven episodes after the pilot, because it was stupid
          and nobody watched it.
          Crap isn't going to sell, no matter how visible it is. Not
          consistently, anyway.

          I've taken to doing all my proofreading (books on mobi and EPUB

          My girlfriend and I trade off proofreading each other's books.
          For some reason she prefers the Kindle Fire for this although

          The one thing that we can all be relatively certain of is that
          things will change.
          In ten years, or twenty, or fifty, computers will be more than
          capable of writing books. Eventually they will be as good, or
          better, than what humans can do. that's the nature of the world
          to come. Most likely at any rate.
          For now we have a window in which we can be the creators. We can
          build worlds and let others join us there. It's a worthy enough
          goal, even if we end up with it not being what we do for the
          rest of our lives.
          As for everyone being able to write a book or two and put it out
          there...
          You know what? Fine. Competition is healthy and will cause us to
          all get better. That or sit one the bottom half of the lists
          where no one will ever see us.
          The people complaining about how hard it is to be seen now are
          kind of humerus. Like people that claim that a book written by a
          good author quickly isn't still a good book. It isn't backed up
          by the evidence, but people persist in making that kind of
          claim, to justify their poor work habits. (Or busy lives and
          distractions. You know, family, friends and all those things
          that get in the way of production.) :)
          A cry of "too many books!" is weak. An effort to control others
          without having to work for it.
          Case in point: Look at the top thousand books right now and
          compare them to the same from a year ago. Two. Ten...
          Do you really think you'll notice a difference in quality? In
          creativity, true, since that has grown nicely after the
          publishers had a little less say, but quality? There isn't a
          vast difference at that level.
          And all of that is picked by the reader. Good books will float
          to the top.

          To play devils advocate - there is a metric used to determine
          how long something will last. Paradoxically the method is this:
          it will last proportionately to how long it has already been
          around. Notice that the oldest audio format (vinyl records) is
          the (out dated) tech to last the longest. Of all the seven
          wonders of the ancient world the only one still around (pyramids
          of Giza) were the oldest at the time (the hanging gardens etc
          are all long since gone). This metric implies that print books,
          while clearly no longer dominant, will still linger on for quite
          some time.

          I didn't even know that some of them have gone (I don't get out
          much :-( ).
          If the print industry, which is supposed to be staffed by very
          smart people (!) can't read the writing on the wall and adapt to
          technology, they're in danger of going the way of all those
          technologies you menioned. Hope it doesn't happen. I like amazon
          to have as much competition as possible in this race. Even when
          the competition refuses to stop binding its ankles together.
          Thanks for all your super posts over the years. It was because

          (thirteen if you count the one my ex-publisher epublished at
          over twice the price of most of mine), with a number more still
          to do.
          I'm actually now a full-time writer with a decent income:
          something I never had while I was on the traditional treadmill.

          I would widen this to include emotion in general.
          Fiction is a vehicle for humans to experience emotion
          vicariously. That's the main purpose of fiction. When computers
          can not only understand but evoke emotion in humans, only THEN
          they will be starting on the road to writing novels.

          But when it comes to big name, big 6 authors, I get down on my
          hands and knees and thank Gutenberg himself for the fact I can
          buy great books at used bookstores or thrift stores for cheap.
          Heck, I can order just about any random, obscure title on
          Amazon, usually for 1 cent and the cost of shipping and
          handling.
          If the Big 6 lower the price on back catalog books to 99 cents,
          then the secondary market might dry up. I think of Roger Ebert
          saying in the 1980s "Movie studios should sell all films for
          $9.99 on VHS." This was when most movies cost $90.00 a copy and
          only video rental stores bought them.
          But then I remember all those old books that are readily
          available for 1 cent that have too small a market for any
          publisher to bother converting to eformat, or the copyright
          holders are nowhere to be found to authorize an e format.
          I love print, I love e. Price matters.

          Buggy whips are still being made! Many tack shops and horse
          supply stores carry them! How dare you insult buggy whips, Joe!
          I have this great buggy whip app on my iPhone. Bet I could even
          use it to spur on real horses. Assuming, of course that I had a
          real horse. Or a buggy, for that matter.
          A year and a half ago I scoffed at the idea of ever getting an
          ereader. Then I my partner moved in with me and I realized I
          needed to clear out a lot of the book collection I had. I
          thought hey, I'll get an ereader and keep my collection on
          there! Since getting my Kindle, I've bought exactly 1 physical
          book. I've bought over 25 eBooks. And they're mostly ones I've
          never read before. The option to carry literally hundreds of
          books around with me in my purse trumps any of that 'real book'
          reading experience. I'd never go back now, unless it was for a
          collectible.
          My CD's are also in a box in the garage. *listens to iPhone*

          Let me just throw a few facts into the ring...
          The CD is a long way from dead as a format. Despite the digital
          downloads market having reached maturity some time ago, the
          majority of album sales in the US are still in physical format.
          And by a wide margin - 63% physical vs 37% download for 2012.
          That's a 4% shift towards download from 2011, but physical
          formats are far from dead. The demise of the chain record store
          has more to do with online sales of CDs by the likes of Amazon
          than downloads from iTunes.
          These are all Nielson figures, by the way. They don't factor in
          single sales - downloads take a greater share - but the CD
          single was in decline long before iTunes was ever conceived of.
          It is correct to call vinyl a specialty item, a niche, but when
          that niche has US unit sales of 4.6M and growing, I wouldn't be
          so quick to dismiss it. There's enough money there to support an
          industry all of its own, from hardware manufacturers to
          independent record stores.
          When you shift your gaze outside of the US to markets like the
          UK and continental Europe, the physical formats look even
          healthier.
          For me as an author, the vast majority of my sales are still in
          paper. The proportion of ebooks to paper books has never risen
          above 20%, even in the US. In the UK, my primary market, the
          percentage is lower.
          To be specific, I just got the first eight weeks' sales figures
          for my newest paperback. Ebooks around 10%, everything else
          paper. My biggest sellers are the supermarkets (Tesco, Asda
          etc), followed by WHS Travel (airports and train stations),
          followed by our one remaining book chain. Right at the bottom,
          representing only a fraction of my sales, is Amazon.
          To be clear, I'm an upper midlister, and have yet to trouble the
          main bestseller lists. But I'm still making a decent living from
          the "legacy" model.
          A lot of people are doing very well with self-publishing. That's
          great. I see that as nothing but healthy, and fair play to
          anyone who can make their living doing what they love. But I
          don't see it as a reason to dance on the grave of a format
          that's still very much alive. This whole Them and Us mentality
          doesn't help anyone.

          Thank you for doing so. I allow anonymous comments in the hope
          that smart folks post, and your comments are smart. Myopic, but
          smart.
          The CD is a long way from dead as a format.
          CD is simply storage for digital music. When was the last time
          you saw someone with a Sony Discman? People rip CDs to iTunes
          and their MP3 devices. Buy a CD format, you have the MP3 format.
          Ditto vinyl. New records are being sold with digital downloads.
          You cannot do that with paper books.
          US unit sales of 4.6M and growing
          4.6M compared to billions is trivial. There is money to be made
          in niche, but this blog post is about how technology makes older
          formats obsolete. Don't confuse niche with what the masses have
          embraced in overwhelming numbers.
          For me as an author, the vast majority of my sales are still in
          paper.
          I'd guess that's either because your publisher is very good at
          distributing your titles, or because your publisher is vastly
          overpricing your ebook versions.
          But I don't see it as a reason to dance on the grave of a format
          that's still very much alive. This whole Them and Us mentality
          doesn't help anyone.
          If the ship is sinking, get off the ship before you go down with
          it. From where you sit, perhaps you haven't noticed the water
          coming in. Or you noticed a trickle, and aren't bothered by it
          because you believe the ship is too big to be affected.
          Kodak didn't fear it until it was too late. They actually
          invented the digital camera. How many travel agents are there
          now compared to 1980? Try to buy a new Betamax.
          My point is we all should be looking toward the future, and
          paper isn't it. I don't see paper going away anytime soon. But I
          do see publishers going bankrupt if they don't change.
          This isn't Us vs. Them. This is a warning. The sky actually is
          falling. Protect yourself. Ignoring the signs, not learning from
          the past, and putting your faith in an archaic, poorly run,
          wasteful, greedy, and often evil industry isn't going to help
          you in your career five or ten years hence, when supermarkets
          stop carrying paperbacks and your publisher still has your
          ebooks at $9.99 and won't EVER give the right back to you.
          Could I be wrong? Sure.
          But my track record for this stuff is pretty good.

          I had a choice when planning for my 2 1/2 week vacation to
          Kauai...Bring 80 paperback books to choose from and pay
          USAirways $70 to check two additonal suitcases, or bring my iPad
          and Droid phone loaded with 80 books (about a third of them
          obtained for free, two written by Joe).
          Very tough choice, but in the end the eBooks won, except for the
          paperback book I brought to read while lounging in the pool.
          Much more cost effective to get the paper wet rather than my
          electronic devices...
          I very much appreciate this blog. Joe's posts of his experiences
          combined with the comments of others are an unbeatable source

          Put your Kindle or tablet in a ziplock bag and you're good to
          go. Touch still works through the plastic.

          True enough. Still, the surface area of my printed book is
          slightly larger than that of my tablet, so it will make a better
          sail for the floating lounge chair I will be commanding.
          Choices...

          ah, this was hilarious. And hopefully true for us

          level, not on, uh, any other level.

          And I didn't even mention Loni Anderson and Lynda Carter's
          Partners in Crime. I probably shouldn't admit to having very old
          and fuzzy copies of each show on my Zune but I will. (yep bet
          you could already tell I wasn't an iPerson). I like to think of
          myself as a quirky eccentric whose exquisite taste will be
          applauded in the distant future...or maybe not:)
          As a reader/librarian I love books but it IS the content not the
          delivery system I love. I can still get gooey over the fantastic
          covers and dust jackets of old (and I mean the 60's and older
          old) but I don't equate that with losing myself in the words. I
          am planning on getting a solar charger so I'm not even that
          worried about power outages anymore.
          Before Amazon, Smashwords, Pubit and the like I could give some
          sympathy to writers who desperately wanted to see their brain
          children on the bookstore shelf but now just shake my head in
          wonderment. I didn't have friends in the publishing business or
          published writer friends who complained and put me in the know
          and yet as far back as the 80's and 90's - I could pick up
          enough knowledge here and there to know that advances for most
          writers could be on the crappy side, income reporting sporadic,
          and marketing support for midlist writers was nil and rather
          than look for new authors publishers would put out reprints out
          the kazoo while still somehow not allowing authors to earn out
          advances. (I remember standing in front of a long row of
          paperbacks thinking this sounds familiar, so does this one and
          finally looking at copyright dates at least half of them were
          reprints with different covers.) If I, with no dog in the hunt,
          can figure out self publishing today is much more viable than
          traditional publishing why on earth can't people who hope to
          make it a career?

          Hey Joe or anyone who describes themselves as an "Indie Author",
          how about making a Wikipedia article for "Indie Author" since
          they don't have one?
          Self-pubber or Self-publisher isn't there either.
          Anyway, "Indie Author" sounds better and has more of mystique to
          it. :)
          It's the perfect opportunity to describe the traits Joe always
          talks about:
          1. Experiment and try different tactics.
          2. Adapt and change your tactics as the times and environment
          changes and new information comes in.
          3. Keep trying until you get lucky.
          4. Share and help your fellow authors and have both arms
          out--one reaching up toward the next level and the other
          reaching down to pull your fellow authors up to your level.
          (Add more traits if there are any.)
          And hey add some traits of your own that Joe hasn't mentioned.
          You're an indie author after all, so you should know what the
          traits are. ;)

          MOVIE INDUSTRY: May I join the conversation?
          EVERYBODY: Sure.
          MOVIE INDUSTRY: At one time some people thought that the movie
          industry would be killed by TV and VCRs. But that didn't happen.
          Millions of people still go to movies.
          TRAIN: Can I join the conversation too?
          EVERYBODY: Yes.
          TRAIN: Some people think trains are old fashioned, but we still
          have our uses. Many people use trains in large urban areas to go
          to work.
          By taking a train, you save on car payments, parking, and
          instead of focusing on driving you can spend time reading Joe
          Konrath's books.
          Also, in terms of large scale shipping on land, shipping food
          for example, trains are the best mode of delivery.
          MOVIE INDUSTRY: I see young people, who use the internet, cell
          phones, and mp3 players, still go to movie theaters.
          TRAIN: On the train, though I see people read on ereaders and
          computers, I still see people read paper books. The other day I
          saw someone on the train reading a paper version of Hugh Howry's
          WOOL.
          MOVIE INDUSTRY: So I think the point that Mr. Train and I are
          making is that the traditional book industry, which will
          probably downsize some more, will still be aorund.

          I answered this three years ago. Destination value vs. journey
          value.
          Movies and trains, like horses and bow-and-arrows, are about the
          journey. That's why they still persist.
          Books are about the destination, not the journey. That's why
          paper will be gone soon.
          But thanks for playing. Next time, read my old posts...

          Is Red Box still around in America? I remember them trying to

          machine somewhere downtown when you can just download on your
          PC? Now, you can still buy DVDs if you want but if it's a rental
          to begin with, why bother about collectables?
