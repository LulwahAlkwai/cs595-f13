Ten Ways to Inhibit Innovation

   by Ron Ashkenas  |   9:03 AM July 24, 2012

   Every company is looking for the magic formula that will produce
   breakthrough products and services. But a better starting point is to
   think about what [48]gets in the way of innovation, especially in firms
   that already have lots of talented, creative, and motivated people. In
   other words, by identifying and removing barriers, it might be possible
   to accelerate innovation simply by leveraging the capability that's
   already there.

   In that spirit, here are ten common inhibitors that can dampen an
   organization's ability to innovate effectively. For each one, think
   about the extent to which it applies to your firm (never? sometimes?
   often?):
    1. Our focus on short-term results drives out ideas that take longer
       to mature.
    2. Fear of cannibalizing current business prevents investment in new
       areas.
    3. Most of our resources are devoted to day-to-day business so that
       few remain for innovative prospects.
    4. Innovation is [49]someone else's job and not part of everyone's
       responsibilities.
    5. Our efficiency focus eliminates free time for fresh thinking.
    6. We do not have a standard process to nurture the development of new
       ideas.
    7. Incentives are geared towards maximizing today's business and
       reducing risk.
    8. Managers are not trained to be innovation leaders.
    9. Managers immediately look for flaws in new ideas rather than tease
       out their potential.
   10. We look at opportunities through internal lenses rather than
       starting with customers' needs and problems.

   After you've thought about these questions individually, bring together
   your team to discuss your answers. You also might want to send the
   questions to a wider group and see how they respond. The key is to use
   this list of inhibitors (and any others you might want to add) as a
   springboard for dialogue about your company's innovation practices and
   culture.

   For example, through this process a group of 50 high-potential senior
   managers from different parts of a manufacturing company all agreed
   that the focus on short-term incentives was making it difficult for
   them to support innovation -- which was contrary to the message that
   the CEO was delivering to them and their people. This led the managers
   to initiate a dialogue with the CEO about alternative ways to fund
   innovation, resource and vet new ideas, and accelerate progress. While
   it's too early to know whether these shifts will make a difference or
   not, they have already reduced frustration and helped eliminate mixed
   messages about innovation.

   All of us in organizations have the capability to innovate. Sometimes
   we just have to get out of our own way.

   What inhibits innovation in your company?
