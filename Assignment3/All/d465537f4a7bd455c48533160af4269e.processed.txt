Are new ultra-cheap 3D printers revolutionary or just toys?

   By [101]Christopher Mims -- May 30, 2013

   Meet the [102]Replicator 2. She's top of the line, for home 3D
   printers, and she'll cost you $2,200, not including shipping.
   Not self-replicating. Yet. MakerBot

   That's about what a good PC cost in the 1980's. And the parallels
   between the personal computing revolution and the one in 3D printing
   are irresistible (they've been made countless times in all [103]the
   usual places). Ok, so these things don't do much more than print out
   easily-breakable, rough-hewn plastic tchotchkes, but watch out! Some
   day we'll use them to [104]solve the really big problems.

   Now meet the Pirate3D printer, care of a startup in Singapore. It
   claims that once it launches, it will be the "world's cheapest" 3D
   printer, at around $350 apiece.
   Pirate3D printer is so named because it's supposed to help you pirate
   physical objects. Pirate3D

   But wait! World's cheapest anythings rarely remain that way for long,
   and Pirate3D's claim seems extra silly considering that another
   company, [105]Hong Kong-based MakiBox, says it will be churning out an
   [106]even cheaper model for as [107]little as $200 by [108]June of
   2013. Meanwhile, current record-holder for world's cheapest 3D printer,
   Printrbot, will be shipping a new model [109]for just $300.
   3d printer from makibox
   The A6 LT will cost you a third as much as an unlocked iPhone. MakiBOX

   What's incredible about these devices is how quickly their prices are
   falling. Just two years ago, a DIY kit for making your own home 3D
   printer--with huge amounts of assembly required--[110]was $500. A year
   later, a comparable but simpler model from Printrbot [111]was $400. And
   as of this year, the list of cheap 3D printers is [112]longer than
   ever.

   If the trend in 3D printers is like the one seen in PCs over the past
   thirty years, the features in [113]$2000 3D printers will rapidly make
   it into the low-end models. Meanwhile, some low-end models will become
   even cheaper, and as more and more people begin playing with them, an
   entire ecosystem will emerge.

   That said, all of these home models [114]remain merely toys; 3D
   printers are still [115]most useful in the context of traditional
   manufacturing.

   So why do home 3D printers matter? Just as with the PCs of yore, kids
   everywhere are going to be playing with these things in their garages,
   learning non-trivial skills that are hard to pick up as an adult, like
   how to model things in 3D and how to get creative with the limits of
   fragile materials and layer-by-layer manufacturing. Those kids will
   grow up and deliver the manufacturing revolution that is the
   promise--but not yet the reality--of 3D printing.
