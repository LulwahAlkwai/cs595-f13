Apple has been trying to trademark `startup' since 2011 in Singapore, China,
US, Australia

   [77]apple apple Digital News Asia [78]reported today that Apple has
   filed a trademark for the word `startup' in Malaysia, which will cover
   retail store services, hardware maintenance, education services, as
   well as hardware and software design.

   Apple has also registered the same trademark for the second time in
   Australia on August 27, according to [79]TM Watch. The first
   application, made in 2011, is stuck in limbo.

   It turns out that the same filing has also been [80]made in Singapore,
   China, and the US since 2011, covering the same type of services. In
   Singapore, the mark is still pending approval despite being registered
   more than two years ago, which suggests that the registration has faced
   complications.

   It is unclear if the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore received
   any objections, since any party can [81]oppose the trademark two months
   after it was filed.

   In the United States, Apple's trademark has faced resistance, according
   to [82]Wired. The computing giant has until September 20 this year to
   respond to the objections.

   The company's trademark application in Singapore was filed through the
   [83]Madrid Protocol, an international registration system for marks of
   which Singapore is a member country. The US, China, and Australia
   registrations have also been filed through the same system.

   While trademarking English words may sound preposterous, it is in fact
   legally possible to trademark them as long as the mark is distinctive
   and capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods or services from
   other traders, intellectual property lawyer Foong Cheng Leong told
   Digital News Asia.

   If successfully registered in a country, Apple would have exclusive
   rights to use the word in the category of services it has specified,
   and even variations like `STARTUP', `Startup', or `StartUp' are
   covered.

   As an example, Foong points out that startup boot camps, accelerator
   programmes and government-initiated programs with the term in their
   names may be liable to trademark infringement should Apple be
   successful.

   But if the [84]trademark distinctiveness test is any indication
   however, Apple's applications may face an uphill climb. Trademark
   registrations are judged based on how unique they are.

   This means that fanciful and arbitrary marks like Exxon for petroleum
   products and Apple for computers are more likely to be accepted since
   they bear no relation to the product.

   On the other hand, generic terms are more likely to be rejected. A term
   like `startup' is already commonly used: Startup a computer, Windows
   Startup, and startup companies are just some examples.

   That said, different jurisdictions may have different ideas about how
   generic a term is.

   Apple has yet to respond to press inquiries on the matter. Its reasons
   for trademarking the word is unclear.
