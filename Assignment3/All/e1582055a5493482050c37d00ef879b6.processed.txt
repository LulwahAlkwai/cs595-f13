   __________________________________________________________________

   It's just after breakfast, and the superheroes are gathering in a
   cavernous white-walled room amid a sea of brightly colored beanbag
   chairs. Once assembled, they place their hands over their hearts, face
   the portraits of Thomas Edison and Bill Gates hung high on the wall,
   and begin reciting their daily oath.

   I will promote freedom at all costs! says Tim Draper, a venture
   capitalist with a microphone slung over his ear and a Save the Children
   tie brightening up his suit.

   I will promote freedom at all costs! the heroes echo back.

   I will do everything in my power to drive, build, and pursue progress
   and change! Draper calls out.

   I will do everything in my power to drive, build, and pursue progress
   and change! they repeat.

   My brand, my network, and my reputation are paramount!
   My brand, my network, and my reputation are paramount!

   These 40 young dreamers are the inaugural class of the Draper
   University of Heroes, Silicon Valley's newest and most unconventional
   boarding school for aspiring tech moguls, located in San Mateo,
   California, just up Route 101 from Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters.
   Most of the students are in their early-to-mid-twenties, and their
   backgrounds are a hodgepodge. There's a Swiss wealth manager, a
   Stanford Ph.D., a former professional football player, and handfuls of
   directionless college graduates for whom Silicon Valley has the same
   mystique that Hollywood or New York holds for others. For the next
   eight weeks, they'll apprentice at Draper's feet, trying to pick up the
   tech world's own brand of magical thinking.

   In the process, they'll be subjected to a fair amount of Draper's
   zany-uncle humor. A little wiggle and you're good! he says, miming a
   chicken dance as he shows the students how to choreograph part of their
   oath.

   Draper, a tall, broad-shouldered bruiser with dark Cro-Magnon eyebrows
   and a mussed head of hair, finishes the oath and begins dividing the
   students into the teams they'll stay on for the rest of the session.
   There are the Wonders, Titans, Lightning, Tornados, Angels, Magic,
   Lanterns, Phoenix, and Blizzard, and while it's not quite clear what
   the teams are competing for, the students all titter at the idea of
   Hogwarts-style tribalism. Draper then asks that they introduce
   themselves with tweet-length autobiographies.

   Collete Davis stands up. A petite Floridian, she came here after
   dropping out of Embry-Riddle, an engineering school. Her goal is to one
   day drive for IndyCar, and she wants to find a way to fuse her racing
   career with an entrepreneurial venture of some sort. Tim Draper has
   allowed her to attend for free in exchange for putting a Draper U.
   decal on her racing car and suit. After she gives her Twitter
   autobiography (Hashtag American, racing driver, IndyCar, STEM
   education, creativity, family, passion), she adds an aspiration from
   her personal bucket list. You know that rap song Wake Up in a New
   Bugatti'? she says. Well, because of where we're at, I'd rather wake up
   in a Tesla!

   Draper lets out a guffaw, then pulls something metallic out of his
   pants pocket and tosses it across the room to Collete, whose eyes bulge
   as she sees what she's been given: the keys to Draper's Model S.

   Go aheadtake it for a spin, he says. Three blocks down that way.

   In the public imagination, Silicon Valley is all moments like theseluck
   and lucre falling out of clear California skies. But the day-to-day
   reality of being young in tech is often less glamorous. Even the
   hottest Internet companies have armies of junior grunts cleaning up
   code and doing corporate salesthe digital-age equivalent of scouting
   locations as a movie production assistant or making Excel spreadsheets
   as a junior Wall Street banker, but the magic of Silicon Valley wraps
   the sectorbanal desk jobs and bold solo projects alikein the banner of
   revolution. You feel special, even if you're just answering the phone.

   Draper University, which officially launched this spring, bills itself
   as a school for innovators, but it's really an eight-week infomercial
   for the culture of Silicon Valley. Its goal is to infect students with
   the exuberance of tech and make them brave enough to leave a
   traditional career path for a stint in start-up land. Unlike at most
   tech incubators, you don't have to have a company to enroll at Draper
   U. You don't even have to have an idea for one. You just have to cough
   up the $9,500 tuition or, alternatively, pledge a small percent of your
   income for the next ten years. (So far, only one person has taken
   Draper up on the latter.)

   Students at Draper are given two days of coding lessons and some
   elementary Excel practice, but most of what they'll learn will be soft
   skills. Instead of teaching hard-core classes in Python and C++, Draper
   offers a cornucopia of team-building activities, which range from
   cooking and yoga classes to wilderness training and karaoke. At the end
   of the session, each student will be a C.A., which stands for change
   agent. They'll also be given two minutes to pitch a panel of investors
   on their business ideas. Like tech incubators Y-Combinator and
   TechStars, which are rewarded for their early support of start-ups with
   a fraction of future earnings, Draper stands to profit from any
   successes that sprout from the program. Draper's son, Adam, has set up
   a tech accelerator, Boost VC, across the street from the school, where
   students can apply to polish their idea. When it's ready for the big
   leagues, one of Draper's venture-capital firms will be there, ready to
   pick up the company for funding. It all helps itself, he says. These
   guys will all have leads for me.

   [86]Next: Draper is a true believer in Silicon Valley's greatness.
