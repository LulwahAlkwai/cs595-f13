Detection theory

   Detection theory, or signal detection theory, is a means to quantify
   the ability to discern between information-bearing patterns (called
   [15]stimulus in humans, [16]signal in machines) and random patterns
   that distract from the information (called [17]noise, consisting of
   background stimuli and random activity of the detection machine and of
   the nervous system of the operator). In the field of [18]electronics,
   the separation of such patterns from a disguising background is
   referred to as signal recovery.^[19][1]

   According to the theory, there are a number of determiners of how a
   detecting system will detect a signal, and where its threshold levels
   will be. The theory can explain how changing the threshold will affect
   the ability to discern, often exposing how adapted the system is to the
   task, purpose or goal at which it is aimed.

   When the detecting system is a human being, experience, expectations,
   physiological state (e.g. fatigue) and other factors can affect the
   threshold applied. For instance, a sentry in wartime will likely detect
   fainter stimuli than the same sentry in peacetime due to a lower
   criterion, however they will also be more likely to treat innocuous
   stimuli as a threat.^[[20]citation needed]

   Much of the early work in detection theory was done by [21]radar
   researchers.^[22][2] By 1954 the theory was fully developed on the
   theoretical side as described by [23]Peterson, Birdsall and Fox^[24][3]
   and the foundation for the psychological theory was made by Wilson P.
   Tanner, David M. Green, and [25]John A. Swets, also in 1954.^[26][4]
   Detection theory was used in 1966 by [27]John A. Swets and David M.
   Green for [28]psychophysics.^[29][5] Green and [30]Swets criticized the
   traditional methods of psychophysics for their inability to
   discriminate between the real sensitivity of subjects and their
   (potential) [31]response biases.^[32][6]

   Detection theory has applications in many fields such as
   [33]diagnostics of any kind, [34]quality control,
   [35]telecommunications, and [36]psychology. The concept is similar to
   the [37]signal to noise ratio used in the sciences and [38]confusion
   matrices used in [39]artificial intelligence. It is also usable in
   [40]alarm management, where it is important to separate important
   events from [41]background [42]noise.

Psychology[43]Edit

   Signal detection theory (SDT) is used when psychologists want to
   measure the way we make decisions under conditions of uncertainty, such
   as how we would perceive distances in foggy conditions. SDT assumes
   that the decision maker is not a passive receiver of information, but
   an active decision-maker who makes difficult perceptual judgements
   under conditions of uncertainty. In foggy circumstances, we are forced
   to decide how far away from us an object is, based solely upon visual
   stimulus which is impaired by the fog. Since the brightness of the
   object, such as a traffic light, is used by the brain to discriminate
   the distance of an object, and the fog reduces the brightness of
   objects, we perceive the object to be much farther away than it
   actually is (see also [44]decision theory).

   To apply signal detection theory to a data set where stimuli were
   either present or absent, and the observer categorized each trial as
   having the stimulus present or absent, the trials are sorted into one
   of four categories:

                           Respond "Absent"  Respond "Present"
          Stimulus Present [45]Miss          Hit
          Stimulus Absent  Correct Rejection [46]False Alarm

   Based on the proportions of these types of trials, numerical estimates
   of sensitivity can be obtained with statistics like the [47]sensitivity
   index d' and A',^[48][7] and response bias can be estimated with
   statistics like c and b.^[49][8]

   Signal detection theory can also be applied to memory experiments,
   where items are presented on a study list for later testing. A test
   list is created by combining these 'old' items with novel, 'new' items
   that did not appear on the study list. On each test trial the subject
   will respond 'yes, this was on the study list' or 'no, this was not on
   the study list'. Items presented on the study list are called Targets,
   and new items are called Distractors. Saying 'Yes' to a target
   constitutes a Hit, while saying 'Yes' to a distractor constitutes a
   False Alarm.

                       Respond "No"     Respond "Yes"
            Target   [50]Miss          Hit
          Distractor Correct Rejection [51]False Alarm

Applications[52]Edit

   Signal Detection Theory has wide application, both in humans and
   [53]other animals. Topics include [54]memory, stimulus characterists of
   schedules of reinforcement, etc.

Sensitivity or discriminability[55]Edit

   Conceptually, sensitivity refers to how hard or easy it is to detect
   that a target stimulus is present from background events. For example,
   in a recognition memory paradigm, having longer to study
   to-be-remembered words makes it easier to recognize previously seen or
   heard words. In contrast, having to remember 30 words rather than 5
   makes the discrimination harder. One of the most commonly used
   statistics for computing sensitivity is the so-called [56]sensitivity
   index, or [57]d'. There are also [58]non-parametric measures, such as
   the area under the [59]ROC-curve.^[60][6]

Bias[61]Edit

   Bias is the extent to which one response is more probable than another.
   That is, a receiver may be more likely to respond that a stimulus is
   present or more likely to respond that a stimulus is not present. Bias
   is independent of sensitivity. For example, if there is a penalty for
   either false alarms or misses, this may influence bias. If the stimulus
   is a bomber, then a miss (failing to detect the plane) may increase
   deaths, so a liberal bias is likely. In contrast, [62]crying wolf (a
   false alarm) too often may make people less likely to respond, grounds
   for a conservative bias.

Mathematics[63]Edit

P(H1|y) > P(H2|y) / MAP Testing[64]Edit

   In the case of making a decision between two [65]hypotheses, H1,
   absent, and H2, present, in the event of a particular [66]observation,
   y, a classical approach is to choose H1 when p(H1|y) > p(H2|y) and H2
   in the reverse case.^[67][9] In the event that the two [68]a posteriori
   [69]probabilities are equal, one typically defaults to a single choice,
   say H2. One could also flip a coin although the expected number of
   errors would be the same.

   When taking this approach, usually what one knows are the conditional
   probabilities, p(y|H1) and p(y|H2), and the [70]a priori probabilities
   p(H1) = \pi_1 and p(H2) = \pi_2 . In this case,

   p(H1|y) = \frac{p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1}{p(y)} ,

   p(H2|y) = \frac{p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2}{p(y)}

   where p(y) is the total probability of event y,

   p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1 + p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2 .

   H2 is chosen in case

   \frac{p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2}{p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1 + p(y|H2) \cdot \pi_2}
   \ge \frac{p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1}{p(y|H1) \cdot \pi_1 + p(y|H2) \cdot
   \pi_2}

   \Rightarrow \frac{p(y|H2)}{p(y|H1)} \ge \frac{\pi_1}{\pi_2}

   and H1 otherwise.

   Often, the ratio \frac{\pi_1}{\pi_2} is called \tau_{MAP} and
   \frac{p(y|H2)}{p(y|H1)} is called L(y) , the [71]likelihood ratio.

   Using this terminology, H2 is chosen in case L(y) \ge \tau_{MAP} . This
   is called MAP testing, where MAP stands for "maximum a posteriori").

   Taking this approach minimizes the expected number of errors one will
   make.

Bayes Criterion[72]Edit

   In some cases, it is far more important to respond appropriately to H1
   than it is to respond appropriately to H2. For example, if one is
   trying to detect an incoming bomber known to be carrying a [73]nuclear
   weapon, it is much more important to shoot down the bomber if it is
   there, than it is not to send a fighter squadron to inspect a false
   alarm (assuming a large supply of fighter squadrons). The [74]Bayes
   criterion is an approach suitable for such cases.^[75][9]

   Here a [76]utility is associated with each of four situations:
     * U_{11} : One responds with behavior appropriate to H1 and H1 is
       true: fighters destroy bomber, incurring fuel, maintenance, and
       weapons costs, take risk of some being shot down;
     * U_{12} : One responds with behavior appropriate to H1 and H2 is
       true: fighters sent out, incurring fuel and maintenance costs,
       bomber location remains unknown;
     * U_{21} : One responds with behavior appropriate to H2 and H1 is
       true: city destroyed;
     * U_{22} : One responds with behavior appropriate to H2 and H2 is
       true: fighters stay home, bomber location remains unknown;

   As is shown below, what is important are the differences, U_{11} -
   U_{21} and U_{22} - U_{12} .

   Similarly, there are four probabilities, P_{11} , P_{12} , etc., for
   each of the cases (which are dependent on one's decision strategy).

   The Bayes criterion approach is to maximize the expected utility:

   U = P_{11} \cdot U_{11} + P_{21} \cdot U_{21} + P_{12} \cdot U_{12} +
   P_{22} \cdot U_{22}

   U = P_{11} \cdot U_{11} + (1-P_{11}) \cdot U_{21} + P_{12} \cdot U_{21}
   + (1-P_{12}) \cdot U_{22}

   U = U_{12} + U_{21} + P_{11} \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21}) - P_{12} \cdot
   (U_{22} - U_{12})

   Effectively, one may maximize the sum,

   U' = P_{11} \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21}) - P_{12} \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12}) ,

   and make the following substitutions:

   P_{11} = \pi_1 \cdot \int_{R_1}p(y|H1)\, dy

   P_{12} = \pi_2 \cdot \int_{R_1}p(y|H2)\, dy

   where \pi_1 and \pi_2 are the a priori probabilities, P(H1) and P(H2) ,
   and R_1 is the region of observation events, y, that are responded to
   as though H1 is true.

   \Rightarrow U' = \int_{R_1} \left \{ \pi_1 \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21})
   \cdot p(y|H1) - \pi_2 \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12}) \cdot p(y|H2) \right \}
   \, dy

   U' and thus U are maximized by extending R_1 over the region where

   \pi_1 \cdot (U_{11} - U_{21}) \cdot p(y|H1) - \pi_2 \cdot (U_{22} -
   U_{12}) \cdot p(y|H2) > 0

   This is accomplished by deciding H2 in case

   \pi_2 \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12}) \cdot p(y|H2) \ge \pi_1 \cdot (U_{11} -
   U_{21}) \cdot p(y|H1)

   \Rightarrow L(y) \equiv \frac{p(y|H2)}{p(y|H1)} \ge \frac{\pi_1 \cdot
   (U_{11} - U_{21})}{\pi_2 \cdot (U_{22} - U_{12})} \equiv \tau_B

   and H1 otherwise, where L(y) is the so-defined [77]likelihood ratio.
