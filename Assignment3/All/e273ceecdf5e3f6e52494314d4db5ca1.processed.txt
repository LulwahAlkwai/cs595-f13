   More than a year after his arrest, [48]Kim Dotcom is going on the
   offense, suing the New Zealand government for the raid on his mansion
   and its preceding surveillance.

   Dotcom filed a lawsuit against the government seeking to be compensated
   for a total amount of $6 million New Zealand dollars (approximately
   $4.85 million), [49]as first reported by The New Zealand Herald. The
   suit was filed earlier in the year, but it was only made public this
   week.

   Encryption Software?

   The exuberant file-sharing entrepreneur wants to be compensated for
   [51]the raid in which Dotcom and his associated were arrested by local
   police working on behalf of the U.S. government on Jan. 20, 2012. The
   controversial operation was preceded by months of surveillance by the
   country's spy agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau
   (GCSB).

   Earlier this year, the New Zealand Appeals Court [52]granted Dotcom the
   right to sue after ruling that the surveillance was illegal.

   For Dotcom, this lawsuit is a chance to show the world that the U.S.
   conspired to spy on him using tools uncovered by [53]NSA leaker
   [54]Edward Snowden.

   "My court case will uncover the truth about the [Government
   Communications Security Bureau] using X-Keyscore, Prism, and the Five
   Eyes spy cloud to spy on New Zealanders. The truth will come out,"
   [55]he told Ars Technica.

   The complaint alleges that the New Zealand spying agency started its
   illegal surveillance on Dotcom and his associates in Dec. 16, 2011.

   In the court filing, Dotcom describes in detail the raid, which was
   carried out by armed police that arrived with two helicopters and vans,
   and broke down the doors of the house. Dotcom himself was "forced to
   the ground and had force applied to him in such a way that left him
   with bruises and abrasions. This was not precipitated by any resistance
   from the first plaintiff to the police."

   The raid, according to the complaint, was unnecessarily violent and
   aggressive.

   "Throughout the operation the Police paid little or no effective regard
   to the rights or needs of the occupants of the properties, and dealt
   with them in a highly aggressive, oppressive and intimidatory fashion,
   such as to cause significant unnecessary distress and anxiety and
   fear," the complaint reads.

   Meanwhile, Dotcom keeps cracking jokes at the expense of U.S.
   authorities.

     I haven't paid my iCloud premium for a year but Apple keeps
     extending it because the FBI has an active warrant on my account.

   States.
