Longest time between posing a math problem and it being answered?

   (We were asked to remind you: ITCS 2014 Call for papers: [5]call for
   papers.)
   What problem in math had the longest time between POSING IT and SOLVING
   it? This might not be a well defined question since the notion of when
   was it posed? might be murky. For some problems even when it was
   solved? might be murky. Nevertheless I have a candidate:

     Is there a straight-edge and compass construction that will, given a
     square, produce a circle with the same area. (This problem is often
     called Squaring the circle..)

   Wikipedia says that [6]Oenopides was the first person to pose
   construction problems and that he posed this one. He was born in
   roughly 500 BC. Even back then there were people who thought it could
   not be done. However, it was proven impossible when pi was shown to be
   transcendental in 1882 by Lindemann. (This was one of the motivations
   for Lindemann.)

   This problem was open for roughly 2300 years.
    1. Is there any solved problem that was open for longer?
    2. Is there any open problem that has been opened for that longer?
    3. If you polled people in 400 BC what they would have guessed for
       which way it would go and when it would be solved?

   Will P vs NP take that long?

       If the problem was posed in 500 BC and proven impossible in 1882
       AD, wouldn't it be open for 500 + 1882 = 2382 years, much greater
       than the 1300 years you claim above?

            I have fixed it - thanks. I did 1882-500 instead of 1882+500.

       The problem of the parallel postulate (in modern terms, to prove it
       from the other axioms of geometry, or to prove it independent of
       them) must be of similar age. Euclid seems to have been aware of
       the problem c. 300 BC (he avoids using his 5th axiom if at all
       possible), and it was solved in 1868 by Beltrami.

       People have been searching for the best way to multiply integers
       since the then-1500-year-old document the Rhind Papyrus was a copy
       of was written. We still don't know, all of written human history
       later.

       The twin prime conjecture has been open for approximately 2300
       years (the conjecture was made by Euclid around 300 BCE).

            The twin prime conjecture is not due to Euclid. See
            http://mathoverflow.net/questions/7639/twin-prime-conjecture-r
            eference
            One could perhaps argue that the question of whether there
            exist any odd perfect numbers is implicit in Euclid, but he
            doesn't pose this question explicitly.

       Garth: it seems like squaring the circle is older by around 200
       years
       (though we may find that people before Euclid posed Parallel
       Postulate
       and have to revise this) but clearly Parallel Postulate is more
       important.
       Jeff: WOW- complexity of Mult still open!
       Yury: Once Twin Primes is solved we'll prob have a new winner of
       the open-the-longest-but-solved contest, unless Mult ever gets
       solved.

       It's actually Lindemann not Lindermann (without the 'r'). But that
       doesn't really matter, I guess.

       How old is the question of whether there is an odd perfect number?

       the question of the existence of odd perfect numbers is also due to
       the greeks/euclid. basically number theory & diophantine eqns are
       the oldest problems. the inherent difficulty of many of them is
       apparently related to the undecidability phenomenon as in the
       matijasevich-davis-robbins-putnam proof.
       re twin primes note theres been a recent breakthrough by zhang
       covered in many places.

       The oldest problem is consistency. It was first studied in ancient
       Mesopotamia, by a Sumerian whose name we do not know. Yet
       strangely, we know how he looked like. He pondered the question
       many a day, the entire time sitting on his chair. This fellow was
       the first royal scribe. He considered himself lucky, he was fast
       and good with numbers. No one knew of a better scribe. He
       considered his talent a gift, which allowed him a comfortable life
       and many luxuries. But he now saw it was also a curse.
       Some sunrises ago, his liege and employer asked him to make a count
       of all the wealth stored in the royal vault, which was comprised of
       various artifacts and valuables. You see, his liege believed he was
       the wealthiest man in the world and he wanted to prove it, by
       measuring his wealth.
       For days the scribe and his assistants had counted, making a list
       of everything in the vault. Then he sat down and multiplied the
       quantities of everything with their value and then summed it all
       up, covering a vast amount of tablets with his scribblings. The
       final amount was extraordinary, never he had written down such a
       big number. He thought his liege would be much pleased. So he wrote
       the result all nice and formal in a royal report and presented it
       to his liege, hoping for a great reward for his endeavors. He did
       not get was he was expecting. You see, when he presented the report
       to his lord, the lord sat skeptical and said:
       "Very well. But are you sure you have not made a mistake?"
       The scribe described how he and his assistants calculated for days.
       He did every operation twice when multiplying and summing, just to
       be sure. But his lord did not understand mathematics and so he said
       to him:
       " But are you certain those... calculations of yours are correct?
       If your methods are false, I shall be ridiculed by all. Begone and
       do not come back until you can show me that this amount is
       correct."
       The scribe, a noble himself, as his father, knew very well the
       punishment for disobeying his lord. So he sat in his chair and
       pondered. He thought for days of how proving his multiplications
       and additions were correct, but thought as he may, he could not
       find a solution. He perished in that very chair, by starvation and
       worry. We may never learn his name, but he was forever immortalized
       by a sculptor of that court, who was fascinated by the
       mathematician who stood there, for days, pondering his seemingly
       inescapable situation.
       [The thinking scribe:

       tatue-of-a-sumerian-scribe.jpg]
       His replacement was his assistant, a good scribe, but he lacked the
       talent of his master for calculations. However, what he lacked in
       talent, he replaced with wit. For you see, when the lord asked him
       for an answer to the same question, the young scribe said:
       "We asked the oracle for an omen, my Lord. The Gods confirm
       everything is in order and this is your true wealth."
       [The above story is of course, fictional.]

       The Biblical prophet Job's (serious) question "[80]Why do the
       righteous suffer?" has remained open for at least the past four
       millennia.
       Until recently, that is! Now David Deutsch is (seriously) proposing
       (in The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the
       World, page 212) the simple (too simple?) STEM-centric (too
       STEM-centric?) answer "[81]All evils are caused by insufficient
       knowledge".
       It will be interesting to see whether the 21st century's
       exponentiating accumulation of STEM-related knowledge results in an
       appreciable global reduction of suffering.
       Summary  So far, so good! :)

       Oenopides of Chios was an ancient Greek mathematician and
       astronomer, who lived around 450 BCE. He was born shortly after 500
       BCE on the island of Chios, but mostly worked in Athens.

       The problem has not been resolved if this "out of the box" rPi
       concept is valid. It promotes a trigonometric understanding of the
       Pi ratio where irrational and transcendental numbers may have less
       influence: http://www.aitnaru.org/images/Pi_Corral.pdf
       The 62.402887364309.. degree radius is consistent in all of the
       designs: any circle can be squared once this angle is known (the
       trigonometry proves this).
       What is rPi? The geometric complement to Pi (all of the known
       digits of Pi can be substituted into the formula).
