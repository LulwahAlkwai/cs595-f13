Google's "Project Loon" flying Internet coming to homes in California

Balloon network test will help Google figure out how to actually make it
work.

   Google is asking residents of Central Valley in California to take part
   in a beta test of Project Loon, the company's ambitious plan to deliver
   Internet access from balloons.

   "Project Loon is looking for folks in the area who are willing to have
   a Loon Internet antenna installed on their house or small business
   building to help test the strength of the Loon Internet connection,"
   Google said on the [9]project's Google+ page. "When balloons fly
   overhead, the Loon Internet antennas will generate traffic that will
   load-test our service."

   Interested residents in Madera, Chowchilla, Mariposa, Merced, or
   Turlock can [10]fill out a survey for the chance to participate. The
   tests will begin in August and run through the end of the year, Google
   said.

   "You'll be asked to help us load test the system during our research
   flights in the coming months," Google said. "Load testing involves
   putting demand on the system and then measuring its response. During
   these research flights, you will be invited to install a specialized
   Internet antenna on your home or business building which will help us
   learn how to deliver reliable, fast Internet connectivity to as many
   people as possible."

   [11]Google unveiled Project Loon in June, conducting the first publicly
   acknowledged tests in New Zealand. Google's balloons have been flying
   for some time, though. Last October, residents of Kentucky noticed one
   of the balloons and called it a UFO, alerting police and attracting the
   attention of the [12]Huffington Post with a YouTube video. Google
   didn't acknowledge the test at the time, but it [13]recently admitted
   that Kentucky residents had seen one of its Project Loon balloons.

   The system is still just experimental, but Google believes it will
   eventually bring Internet access to many parts of the world where
   people have little or no connectivity. The balloons are sent into the
   stratosphere and fly untethered, but Google says it uses "complex
   algorithms" along with wind and solar power to control their movement.
   The balloons form a mesh network 20 kilometers above the ground, with
   each balloon communicating with its neighbors and ultimately to ground
   stations connected to Internet providers.
