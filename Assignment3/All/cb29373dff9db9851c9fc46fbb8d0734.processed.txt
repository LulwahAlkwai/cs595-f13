   [27]Design and Build Weekend

   Update: We are excited to add [28]Pebble smart watches to our
   hackathon! Read below for details.

   Join us in 3 weeks in Silicon Valley for our first ever Design & Build
   Weekend at Evernote HQ! After hosting many designer/developer events
   and workshops around the world, we are thrilled to finally bring the
   hackathon to our home turf and challenge app creators to build projects
   that sync with the Evernote API.

   [29]To attend our Design & Build Weekend, please RSVP for the event
   here »

All-New Integrations

   We have some fantastic partners for the hackathon and our ongoing
   [30]Evernote Devcup challenge. Our co-host for the design & build
   weekend is [31]Honda Silicon Valley Lab (HSVL), Honda's open innovation
   lab in Silicon Valley. HSVL will be launching a brand new API platform
   for developers at the event. In addition, we are introducing a new
   Hardware Hack section for the event, with special guests Leap Motion
   and NODE sensor!

Honda Silicon Valley Lab (HSVL) API

   [32]Honda Silicon Valley Labs
   Honda Silicon Valley Lab is introducing the HSVL API platform for
   connecting into smart cars and providing developers with active data.
   For developers interested in the quantified self, the internet of
   everything, and life logging - this will be a brand new set of data for
   your applications. In addition, this hackathon will connect HSVL with
   developers in the community working on compelling and interesting use
   cases for the future of mobility.

Intelligent Design & Hardware Hacks

   [33]intel_design

Leap Motion

   Evernote users have stored billions of notes in their accounts for the
   last 6+ years. The API team at Evernote loves to feature developers who
   build new ways for exploring notes and helping our 50+ million users
   get more out of Evernote.

   When it comes to the future of the user interface, we are thrilled to
   include [34]Leap Motion for the Design & Build Weekend! We will be
   challenging design and dev teams to envision hand and gesture control
   of notes. This could include recipe book flipping, fast sorting,
   notebook stack visualization, and more.

   The best app that uses Leap Motion and Evernote will receive Leap
   Motion devices and the possibility of being featured in their new app
   store, [35]Air Space. [36]Explore the Devcup forum for Leap Motion app
   ideas »

Pebble

   [37]Pebble, one of the early trailblazers in the era of wearable
   technology, is the first smartwatch built for the 21st Century.
   Connecting wirelessly to Android and iOS smartphones via Bluetooth, the
   Pebble Smartwatch brings an high resolution e-paper display to your
   wrist, displaying notifications and information directly from a mobile
   device.

   But the true power of Pebble will come from apps. Track your speed,
   distance, and pace data with a cycling or running app that delivers
   information to the watchface, or pause and skip tracks on your phone's
   music app with the touch of a button. The Pebble SDK is versatile and
   ready for developers to build with it.

   At the Hackathon, Pebble will provide support for all the teams working
   with their SDK, and the top three teams will win a device to continue
   their development. Winning teams will be automatically entered into
   Devcup and will win watches for the entire team as well as a chance to
   win Devcup Gold.

NODE

   [38]NODE is a wireless sensor platform that can measure anything from
   movement and color to gasses, depending on the interchangeable sensors.
   Node began on Kickstarter in 2012 and has since added many new sensors
   including the CHROMA that allows for accurate color scanning,
   previously only available with expensive spectrometers. The CHROMA
   brings color matching for paints or fabrics to your smart device and is
   a must have for contractors, artists and interior architects. Check out
   [39]nodesensors.com to learn more about the NODE platform. There are
   countless ways users can create a collection of data in Evernote with
   Node to help them understand more about the world around them. Can you
   bring the power of mobile sensors to Evernote?

   Every team that develops a working NODE app can keep their NODE, will
   be featured on the NODE website and will get a free ticket to the
   upcoming NODEVCON.

Weekend Workshops

   [40]Workshops

   Collaboration and learning come together at our hackathons, and the
   main tool we support this ecosystem of innovation is through weekend
   workshops. Attendees of the Design & Build Weekend are invited to all
   our open workshops to learn more about the specific technologies
   involved and jumpstart their projects.

   Some highlights for the weekend workshops:
     * Evernote API overview (basic & advanced)
     * HSVL API overview
     * Leap Motion SDK overview
     * Node SDK overview
     * Amazon Web Services getting started
     * Startup pitch training workshop

Design & Build Weekend Hackathon and the Evernote Devcup

   [41]Evernote Devcup

   All applications built over the weekend are eligible for entry in the
   Evernote Devcup, our annual developer competition. To learn more about
   the global competition for apps that integrate with the Evernote API,
