[4]Big-O notation and real-world performance

   Classical Newtonian mechanics is always mathematically consistent.
   However, Newtonian mechanics assumes that bodies move without friction
   and that we stay far from the speed of light. When your car is stuck in
   the mud or you are running an intergalactic spaceship, frictionless
   Newtonian mechanics is the wrong model even though it remains
   mathematically consistent. Why do we still use Newtonian mechanics?
   Because it gets the job done in many practical cases.

   Similarly, in computer science, we routinely analyze algorithms using
   the [5]big-O notation. This notation is always mathematically
   consistent. In this sense, it is always right.

   However, most computer scientists and engineers use the big-O notation
   as a model for real-world performance (at a high level). So if a
   computer scientist tells you that algorithm X runs in time O(n^2)
   whereas a algorithm Y runs in time O(n log n), you expect that for some
   large but reasonable value of n and for some data, algorithm Y will be
   faster than algorithm X. If it does not happen, it does not mean that
   the big-O notation is mathematically wrong, but it means that it is
   wrong as model for real-world performance. It must be rejected. That
   is, the big-O notation does not model real-world performance and is not
   useful as a scientific model. That's just like saying that if you run
   an intergalactic spaceship, Newtonian mechanics is wrong. It is not up
   to debate: Newtonian mechanics will simply fail to model how your
   engine relate to the speed of your ship.

   What do I mean by large but reasonable value of n? First we must agree
   that there is a limit. Just consider that our solar system is finite.
   We could spend all our ressources on a single massive computer, but it
   would still be finite. Even if we were to expand the computer to
   encompass all of the universe, it would still be finite. So there is
   clearly a limit to how big n can be. In practice, this limit is set by
   the practical problems we encounter. If, for your problems, n is too
   small, then the big-O notation is the wrong model for you.

   To make matters worse, nobody uses the same program to process 10KB and
   to process 100TB of data. Suresh [6]summarizes the problem:

     Asymptotics will eventually win out, as long as everything else
     stays fixed. But that's the precise problem. Everything else doesn't
     stay fixed. Well before your n log n algorithm beats the n ^2
     algorithm, we run out of memory, or local cache, or something else,
     and the computational model changes on us.

   So even if your algorithm would eventually win out for a value of n
   that is not outrageous, your asymptotic analysis can still be
   irrelevant because larger values of n are handled with a different
   architecture.

   Ultimately, the big-O notation is a tremendously useful but crude tool.
   It is great to convey broad ideas. It can help to explain some simple
   decisions. For example, if you need to search an element in an array
   and you expect the array to be large, you might just say that you opt
   for a binary search instead of a sequential scan because the former has
   O(log n) complexity wheres the latter has O(n) complexity. It is
   unlikely that your colleagues will expect you to run benchmarks. In
   this case, the big-O notation captures and summarizes our knowledge of
   the problem.

   However, when designing a software system, the fraction of your
   decisions that rely on big-O analysis is small. Good engineers rely on
   more sophisticated models and metrics. In this sense, it is unfair to
   compare the big-O notation with Newtonian mechanics. The latter allows
   you to model complex problems from start to finish with exact results
   (under some assumptions that can be almost realized). The big-O
   notation is far more limited in its applications. Of course, when it is
   applicable, the big-O notation is tremendously powerful.

    1. This reminds me of my post, O(n) beats O(lg n) I wrote a while ago:

    2. Further, Jeff Ulmann complained about people using easy test sets
       that show their algorithm working, while, in the real word this
       would not happen. Some, even cheat.
       The same problem is with Big-O notation. Computer scientists derive
       new estimates using clever mathematical tricks. The problem is that
       these tricks introduce such enormous constants, so that (I believe)
       a majority of Big-O published formulas are totally bogus.
       They are mathematically correct, but you would never get a
       sufficiently large n.

    3. I recently optimised an algorithm that was part of a scientist's
       MATLAB program. I described how I did it to a computer scientist
       who poured scorn on my work `Trival! It changes nothing in the
       big-O sense'
       The scientist, who's workflow was now many times faster, bought me
       a case of wine.

    4. I think another way to say this is that for real world problems the
       constant matters. If you really want to know what is faster you
       need to work harder and get a sharp bound. Big-O just tells you how
       the bound will scale with size. However, if the difference is
       between O(log(n)) and O(n), then the ratio of constants must be
       pretty big for log(n) not to win for any appreciable n.

    5. @Carson Chow. The problem is that it is not always log(n) vs n.
       Quite often it is log^3(n) or, say, log^5(n). (have a real example,
       of course).

    6. Mike, you need to find a computer scientist to talk to who isn't an
       idiot.

    7. In addition to this point, the smaller but important point is that
       big-O gives only an upper bound, asymptotically, and not
       necessarily a tight one. Use big-Omega for that. See
       [23]http://mcw.wordpress.fos.auckland.ac.nz/2011/09/27/big-omicron-
       and-big-omega-and-big-theta/
       Comment by [24]Mark C. Wilson -- 12/7/2013 @ [25]13:34
    8. So, if I may paraphrase, big O-notation is a mathematically very
       useful notion that allows us to talk about algorithms very
       reasonably, and often corresponds pretty directly to reality. But
       you have to consider it with a grain of salt -- hidden constant
       factors, the fact that it's asymptotic, it doesn't (by itself,
       necessarily) take into account parallelism/caches/other hardware
       issues all are things to worry about.
       Great. My lecture in my algorithms class has all bases covered.

    9. (Oh, and I forgot -- it's worst case analysis, not
       average/typical/whatever your case is analysis. That's in my
       lecture too.)

   10. @Michael
       I would hope that everything in this blog post is standard
       knowledge and uncontroversial.
       Comment by [28]Daniel Lemire -- 12/7/2013 @ [29]23:23
   11. While I'd agree that the limitations of the O notation you describe
       should be uncontroversial (and should be clearly taught with the
       notation), I think you exaggerate when you say:
       "However, when designing a software system, the fraction of your
       decisions that rely on big-O analysis is small. Good engineers rely
       on more sophisticated models and metrics."
       and
       "The big-O notation is far more limited in its applications."
       In my experience, a great many basic decisions stem from
       understanding what your code is doing at the level of counting
       operations -- is it linear, quadratic, n log n, etc. -- and then
       fine-tuning for constant factors.
       So while I agree with all of your caveats, I think of O-notation as
       not being useful as still an exceptional rather than common case.

   12. Asymptotic analysis tends to be more relevant with polynomial
       complexities than with (poly-)logarithmic ones. After all, log n ~=
       30 is usually a reasonable estimate, while cache misses cost from
       tens to hundreds of CPU cycles.
       Comment by [31]Jouni -- 15/7/2013 @ [32]9:49
   13. Jouni, as far as I remember (let anybody correct me if I am wrong),
       quadratic time algorithm for suffix-tree(array) construction are
       faster in practice than linear ones.
       Comment by [33]Itman -- 15/7/2013 @ [34]10:07
   14. Itman: A few years ago the fastest suffix array construction
       algorithms (at least under some assumptions) were indeed O(n^2 log
       n)-time. These days the fastest well-known implementation (under
       similar assumptions) is Yuta Mori's libdivsufsort, which uses an
       O(n log n)-time algorithm.
       The caveat is that the benchmarks are usually done with small
       inputs of up to ~100 MB in size. With such small inputs, memory
       locality and various heuristic tricks play more important role than
       in the multi-gigabyte range.
       Comment by [35]Jouni -- 15/7/2013 @ [36]10:36
   15. Jouni,
       Thank you for the update. Yes, this may be the case. But, still, up
       to a "small" 100 MB input, the quadratic beats the classic LINEAR.
       Comment by [37]Itman -- 15/7/2013 @ [38]11:16
   16. Itman: The quadratic complexities of those fast algorithms are
       basically rough upper bounds. A reasonably straightforward
       implementation of naive suffix sorting takes O(nL log n) time,
       where L is the average LCP value. The fast "quadratic time"
       algorithms basically improve upon this in two ways:
       1) They identify a subset of suffixes, whose sorted order can be
       used to induce the order of the rest of the suffixes. This
       typically improves the running time by a constant factor.
       2) They use some heuristics to identify long repetitions, and sort
       them in some other way. There are known bad cases for some of the
       heuristics, but even then the asymptotic complexity does not grow
       over the naive O(nL log n). For other heuristics, neither bad cases
       nor better time bounds are known.
       Now consider a snapshot of the English language Wikipedia. In the
       first tens of megabytes, the average LCP is in low tens. When we
       increase dataset size to hundreds of megabytes or even a few
       gigabytes, L increases into the 50-100 range. After that, L starts
       to rise, reaching the 500-1000 range with dataset size in tens of
       gigabytes.
       Then consider the human genome. Due to the long runs of Ns (unknown
       bases), the average LCP in the entire reference genome is in
       hundreds of thousands. Yet this is exactly the kind of repetition
       the heuristics in the quadratic algorithms can easily handle. If we
       ignore the Ns, the average LCP drops below 100 for the most of the
       chromosomes (I couldn't find the numbers for the entire genome).
       In both cases, asymptotic analysis gives us reasons to believe that
       the speed of the "quadratic" algorithms should be in the same
       neighborhood as the linear and O(n log n)-time algorithms, at least
       if we consider the typical ~100 MB test cases. Yet as the Wikipedia
       example suggests, the situation may change with larger inputs.
