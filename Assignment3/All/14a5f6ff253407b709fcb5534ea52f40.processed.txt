What is "derp"? The answer is technical.

   Author: [5]Noah Smith
   [johnny_derp_depp.jpg?w=720]
   There has been much discussion lately concerning the word "derp" and
   its appropriate usage. For example, Josh Barro [6]used the word to
   describe conservative bigmouth Erick Erickson, and Paul Krugman [7]used
   it as well. This prompted [8]a primer on the history of the term,
   followed elsewhere by [9]the usual hand-wringing by self-appointed
   cultural policemen annoyed by the word.
   Now, I myself have used the word "derp" [10]quite a lot. Possibly more
   than any other pundit I know, with the exception of Dave Weigel. But in
   any case, not only do I consider myself an expert in the use of "derp",
   I also have a very precise idea of what "derp" means, and how it should
   be used. I think "derp" is incredibly useful as a term for an important
   concept for which the English language has no other word.
   It has to do with Bayesian probability.
   [11]Bayesian probability basically says that "probability" is, to some
   degree, subjective. It's your best guess for how likely something is.
   But to be Bayesian, your "best guess" must take the observable evidence
   into account. Updating your beliefs by looking at the outside world is
   called "[12]Bayesian inference". Your initial guess about the
   probability is called your "prior belief", or just your "prior" for
   short. Your final guess, after you look at the evidence, is called your
   "posterior." The observable evidence is what changes your prior into
   your posterior.
   How much does the evidence change your belief? That depends on three
   things. It depends on A) how different the evidence is from your prior,
   B) how strong the evidence is, and C) how strong your prior is.
   What does it mean for [13]a prior to be "strong"? It means you really,
   really believe something to be true. If your start off with a very
   strong prior, even solid evidence to the contrary won't change your
   mind. In other words, your posterior will come directly from your
   prior. (And where do priors come from? On this, Bayesian theory is
   silent. Let's assume they come directly from your...um...posterior.)
   There are many people who have very strong priors about things. For
   example, there are people who believe, very strongly, that solar power
   will never be cost-efficient. If you confront them with [14]evidence of
   solar's rapid price declines, they will continue to insist that,
   despite this evidence, solar will simply never be cost-competitive with
   fossil fuels. That they continue to insist this does not necessarily
   make them irrational in the Bayesian sense; they simply have very
   strong priors. Someday they may be convinced - for example, if and when
   unsubsidized solar power starts being adopted on a mass scale. It'll
   just take a LOT to convince them. (A more entertaining example can be
   seen in [15]this classic comedy video.)
   But here's the thing: When those people keep broadcasting their priors
   to the world again and again after every new piece of evidence comes
   out, it gets very annoying. After every article comes out about a new
   solar technology breakthrough, or a new cost drop, they'll just repeat
   "Solar will never be cost-competitive." That is unhelpful and
   uninformative, since they're just restating their priors over and over.
   Thus, it is annoying. Guys, we know what you think already.
   English has no word for "the constant, repetitive reiteration of strong
   priors". Yet it is a well-known phenomenon in the world of punditry,
   debate, and public affairs. On Twitter, we call it "derp".
   So "derp" is a unique and useful English word. Let's keep using it.
   (Also, the verb associated with "derp" is "herp". It describes the
   action of coughing a large sticky mass of derp onto the internet in
   front of you. For example, to use it in a sentence: "That twerp just
   herped a flerp of derp!" A "flerp" is a unit I made up. It is the
   amount of derp that can be herped by one twerp. See?)

       How many utils per flerp does a twerp get from herping derp? The
       evidence would seem to indicate that the marginal utility of
       herping derp can be increasing in flerps per herp.

            Using the theory of diminishing marginal returns, I believe "
            the utility of herping derp can be increasing in flerps per
            herp". But the Marginal Utility would have to be decreasing.

            Maybe herping derp is an example that violates the law of
            diminishing marginal returns (DMR). Your prior is that DMR is
            always true, however, the evidence is that twerps receive
            greater marginal returns per flerp the more derp they herp.
            Since the evidence is infinite and self evident, no prior
            belief, no matter how strongly held, can withstand it.

       Love the wording of this description of Bayesian probability. It
       takes what seems like a complicated concept, and explains it
       clearly and simply.
       Some cliches/quotes can be described based on this:
       "If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything" - If
       you have a weak prior, weak evidence will change your belief
       disproportionately than if you had a strong prior
       "Extraordinary allegations require extraordinary evidence."-
       Lance Armstrong. The cheater, using this concept to his advantage.
       "A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence."

       My first thought when I first saw the word was that it might have

       Sadly, although I have a reasonable understanding of Bayesian
       probability, like Blue Aurora above I had no idea what a "derp" was
       before reading this.
       Great article, thanks. One (very minor) quibble: you say "That is
       unhelpful and uninformative, since they're just restating their
       priors over and over." Technically, they are stating their
       posterior - it's just very similar to their prior. But, hopefully,
       each new piece of evidence makes another little dent in it.
       Of course, some people's prior assumptions may be so strong that
       the evidence can't change it (see Cromwell's rule)...

       I think your definition is a bit off, since it's perfectly possible
       to have a high prior *and* be willing to change that prior quickly
       in the light of new evidence. For example, I assign a high prior to
       propositions like "there isn't a tiger in my bathroom right now,"
       but am willing to change it in a hurry if I see/hear otherwise.
       I don't think probability theory has an accepted term for what you
       are talking about, though I know Brian Skyrms calls it
       "resiliency." A probability assignment is resilient to the degree,
       roughly, that you are unwilling to change it in the light of new
       evidence (but will instead change your probability assignments on
       other statements). It's an instance of what philosophers of science
       call the "Quine-Duhem problem"--you can always hold any to any
       theory (however crazy) so long as you are willing to changes to
       other beliefs.

            Brendan,
            In your example, if you have a high prior for not-tiger (say
            0.99), you must assign a correspondingly low probability to
            seeing a tiger in your bathroom, as p(~tiger) = 1-p(tiger).
            Now say you see the tiger, call that evidence E. How likely is
            it that you see the tiger if the tiger is there? Say 0.9. How
            likely is it that you see the tiger if the tiger isn't there?
            Say 0.01 (the 1% accounting for sudden psychosis, drugs,
            etc.). Now, by Bayes' Rule, p(tiger|E)
            =(p(E|tiger)*p(tiger))/p(E) = (0.9*0.1)/0.11 ~= 0.82. Seem
            reasonable?
            Wallfly, it is very much related to falsifiability.
            P(tiger|E) = p(tiger)*p(

            Sharif,
            Yep, that's a good way of modeling a simple case. One of way
            of thinking about what is happening with derping is that (1)
            they assign super-high probabilities to certain propositions
            AND (2) they "insulate" these priors from revision by failing
            to assign high (or low) likelihoods to any particular
            predictions. So, for example, logical truths (such as "it is
            either raining right now or not raining right now") will tend
            to be well insulated (since they don't allow for many precise
            predictions), whereas beliefs about tigers won't be (since
            they do allow for predictions). Beliefs about economic theory
            *ought* to be more similar to the tiger case, but derpers fail
            to see this.
            Of course, another possibility is that the derpers simply have
            incoherent probability assignments, and thus shouldn't be
            modeled using Bayesian epistemology at all. But that's no fun.

       Is derp then always a hypothesis, a la this Bayesian definition.
       I.e., it seems there should be a distinction between between values
       (which are typically strongly held), and beliefs about the way the
       world is (the "model of" side of Geertz's definition of ideology -
       in contrast to the "model for").
       What I am getting at is, some values (or lack thereof) may be

       For example, there are people who believe, very strongly, that
       solar power will be cost-efficient. If you confront them with
       evidence that, according to Todd Woody of the New York Times,
       "Worldwide, testing labs, developers, financiers and insurers are
       reporting similar problems and say the $77 billion solar industry
       is facing a quality crisis just as solar panels are on the verge of
       widespread adoption," they will continue to insist that, despite
       this evidence, solar will soon be cost-competitive with fossil
       fuels."
       In addition, your link is far less positive about solar than you
       imply, pointing out that fossil fuels are still far cheaper, and
       that there's no way to store the electricity that solar cells
       generate.

            1/ Disco Stu's projections are exponential, not linear.
            2/ Because a 40-year trend of continued falling costs in solar
            power is the same as a 2 or 3 year trend of rising disco
            record sales, right?
            The latter is a short-term trend based on fickle consumer
            tastes. The former is a long-term trend based on improved
            technology and there are massive, massive incentives for
            continued investment and innovation -- falling energy costs,
            and clean non-polluting energy!
            Obviously there are some potential hurdles and stumbling
            blocks on the road toward solar energy that is cheaper than
            fossil fuels. But comparing it to disco record sales is a
            pretty big herp.

       The word "derp" comes from South Park (and BASEketball before
       that). I think it's a little ridiculous that you "consider
       [yourself] an expert in the use of 'derp,'" given that your version
       of derp is quite different from the word Stone and Parker coined.
       Whereas "derp!" was originally an exclamatory phrase, you use it as
       a noun. Both uses call to mind similar associations, but they are
       entirely different parts of speech, and therefore they are used in
       very different contexts.
       What I mean to say is, you're welcome to use derp in this new
       way--language is meant to change over time, and that's perfectly
       great-- but before you call yourself an expert in the use of a
       word, you might as well look in to the other ways that people use
       that same word.

       Love the post & thanks for the info. However, your definition of
       the Flerp - "the amount of derp that can be herped by one twerp" -
       could be improved by adding a temporal dimension, and the Friedman
       Unit would be the most appropriate denominator.
       But what would the numerator be? Perhaps "MeMes" - (pronounced "Me!
       Me!") to undermine the impressive aspect of "meme" as a measure of
       meaning, reminding the audience that the derp the twerp herped
       contains no real meaning beyond a cry for attention.
       But the average twerp could probably produce an awful lot of MeMes
       per Friedman unit, so the Flerp is kinda like the Tesla - a unit
       which suffers from being rather too large for daily use (unless you
       study solar flares or run an MRI clinic). But this makes it (the
       Flerp) even more useful rhetorically, when one can accuse a twerp
       of herping a whole flerp of derp in 120 charaters or le
       -elkern

       "And where do priors come from? On this, Bayesian theory is

       I'd have to think Bayesian statisticians and econometricians would
       think that the prior belief should come from an intelligent logical
       evaluation of the prior data, information, evidence. It shouldn't
       be a dogmatic.
       My adviser was a successful Bayesian, Chris Lamereoux. Once in a
       conversation he summed it up well; any good statistician will
       consider the prior, and other evidence outside of the current
       study, in an intelligent way in coming up with final beliefs, but
       Bayesians do so in a very formal way. But he agreed with me that
       that formality can be a straight jacket that can lead to a less
       accurate intelligent conclusion than a more flexible analysis and
       inclusion of your other evidence.

            And I should note that Bayesians also do sensitivity analysis
            with priors. In other words, they try a series of ever
            stronger priors to see if the conclusion still hold up
            qualitatively to them.

            There was a comment (by Nate Silver? Krugman? A poli sci
            blogger?) that one advantage of formal models is that they
            force you to state your assumptions explicitly (being aware,
            of course, about implicit zeros from unconsidered factors).
            As has been repeatedly pointed out, many frequentist
            procedures are equivalent to certain Bayesian procedures,
            given certain priors. This means that non-Bayesians are doing
            Bayesian-equivalent work, but without acknowledging or
            examining priors.

       Strong priors do at times make sense. Say you go to a magic show,
       and the magician is very impressive and you don't have an idea how
       they did most of the tricks. Do you assume that everything you know
       about physics is wrong, or do you consider the possibility that
       Penn and Teller are just very good at their job?
       Note, I saw a couple of episodes of a TV show where magicians tried
       to fool Penn and Teller, as in showing them a trick and the two
       tried to figure out how it was done, and a few managed to fool Penn
       and Teller themselves.

       Bayesian probability is a form of pseudo-science, as any with a
       formal education in mathematics should know, I say this because
       even though I find your post hilarious... I also find you
       constantly invoke Bayes.
       Probability is a just a subset of measure theory, in particular,
       let F be a sigma algebra on a non-empty set S, and Pr a valued
       function on F, then Pr is a probability measure on F if and only if
       i) Pr is non-negative real valued function on F.
       ii) Pr is completely additive in F (for any countably infinite
       collection of pairwise disjoint sets in F, the probability of their
       union equals the sum of their probabilities).
       iii) Pr is normed (Pr(S)=1).
       Obviously we can form state spaces and so on using the correct
       definition of the mathematical meaning of probability, and it's
       completely impossible to force a Bayesian read of this (there's no
       enough variables to represent the nonsense, even if you assume that
       the domain is a collection of mental facts).

       "(And where do priors come from? On this, Bayesian theory is

       your...um...posterior.)"
       Is it really silent? My understanding is that, as a field of study,
       it's clamorously noisy on that subject. The first (rather obvious)
       suggestion would be that we adopt as our priors all the previously
       established body of knowledge discovered by science. That way, if
       we see a rock falling upward, we can with some confidence rule out
       a lot of silly ideas to do with telekinesis, and instead home in on
       things like (a) a tornado in the vicinity, (b) it's not really a
       rock, (c) you imagined it, etc. If you want to find the objective
       truth, you need priors to guard you against taking a single freak
       result too seriously - they give appropriate weight to the previous
       mountain of evidence.
       It was neat wordplay, but there's a possible implication here that
       you suspect all the previously established body of knowledge
       discovered by science was just pulled out of someone's ass, or else
       that you think I'd be no worse off if I pulled some alternative
       beliefs out of my own. And I'm fairly sure you don't believe that!
       The problem with derp is not that these commentators have strong
       priors, but that they are simply not doing anything like "updating"
       of anything recognizably based in the hard-won established
       scientific knowledge.
       They started with what they *wished* to be true, and now, whatever
       happens, they continue to cling to their comforting, fluffy
       myth-blanket, regardless. Just like religious folks. Not remotely
       related to Bayesian inference.

            Unfortunately, the word "Bayesian" has been used as a talisman
            by certain internet pundits to explain why hypotheses they
            don't like can't be true no matter what data support them. If
            the guy doing the assignment of prior probabilities insists,
            for example, that a non-Western medical treatment is as
            unlikely to be effective as a rock is to fall upward, then a
            dozen positive clinical trials can still leave him virtually
            certain that all of the actual *science* related to the
            hypothesis is wrong and should be rejected out of hand. A
            statistician might call him a Dunning-Kruger case, but he's an
            extreme example of the overall truth that most of the
            hypotheses we ponder involve subjects far less certain than
            gravity, and even if there has been some formal scientific
            study of the subject, one's evaluation of its meaning and
            strength will always be influenced by one's personal beliefs.
            Any estimation of the strength of new evidence for a
            hypothesis will be equally influenced by ideology - so if I
            like a study's results, I will say that p<.01 is very strong
            evidence, while if you don't like them, you will find some
            reason to call the study "flawed", "weak", or even
            "worthless". So I wonder if "Bayesian" talk without attached
            and fully justified numbers is not simply a form of
            pseudoquantification designed to intimidate one's ideological
            opponents.
            There is also, by the way, the question of what kinds of
            evidence qualify as evidence at all. You suggest that priors
            might be derived from all previous "knowledge discovered by
            science." This opens up a can of worms regarding, at least,
            the treatment of knowledge not discovered by formal science.
            In my opinion, the proposition that rocks do not fly was
            adequately supported far earlier and more strongly by a couple
            hundred thousand years of human experience, involving
            literally trillions of man-hours of observation of rocks in
            their natural habitats, than by the relatively limited and
            theoretical scientific studies of the matter. If we presume
            that it is correct to reject the evidence of one's eyes in the
            case of a particular flying-rock sighting today, it would also
            have been correct to do so in ancient Rome on the basis of
            general understanding regarding the behavior of rocks. You
            certainly did not suggest that you think persons in ancient
            Rome or in nonliterate traditional cultures today could not
            claim to know that rocks don't fly - but there are others out
            there on the Net who imply just that, with some serious and in
            my opinion unsupportable epistemological implications.

       The resistance or transition time to overcome strong priors may
       perhaps be reduced by smart implementations of at least two
       mechanisms: 1. an integrated 'incentivization' mechanism such as
       +/- reps, shares, and re-tweets and properly feeding that back into
       to users view. 2. A 'credibility' badge overlay (also in the form
       of an incentivization element) that rewards users who have
       exhibited the capacity to overcome strong priors. We've seen
       evidence that both can be effective if properly utilized. In
       addition, we are developing technologies to implement these
       techniques which will ultimately be used to 'measure' the notions
       of credibility and truth of people in online discussions.

       This is a great explanation for how internet pundits think about

       What you're describing is closer to Bayesian updating, and even
       then, you're not describing it very well. (For one, because
       Bayesian updating rules are pretty tricky, not widely accepted, and
