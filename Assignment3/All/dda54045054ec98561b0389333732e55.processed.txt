   The Problem

   Opponents of reproductive choice have been attempting to frighten women
   in recent years by touting a medically unsupported link between
   abortion and an increased risk of breast cancer. Despite evidence to
   the contrary and lack of support for the claim from research scientists
   and breast cancer activists, anti-choice organizations have been trying
   to disseminate the message to women through advertising campaigns,
   so-called informed consent laws, and even through the National Cancer
   Institute.

   Research Findings

   In 2003, the world's leading experts on the interactions between
   pregnancy and breast cancer met to evaluate the research and agreed
   that there is strong evidence that abortion does not increase the risk
   of breast cancer.
     * The strongest single study of abortion and breast cancer, a 1997
       Danish study published in The New England Journal of Medicine,
       reported on the experience of over 300,000 women who had had
       abortions. It found that those women were no more likely to develop
       breast cancer than were the 1.2 million women with no history of
       abortion.
     * More recent studies -including two conducted in China -- have also
       found no association between abortion and breast cancer risk
       (International Journal of Cancer and British Journal of Cancer).

   Even those scientists whose work is cited to support the claim that
   abortion causes breast cancer disagree. Anti-abortion groups have
   presented unconfirmed, disputed data as fact in order to advance their
   political agenda by exploiting women's fear of breast cancer. There is
   currently no scientifically-based reason for women to factor an
   increased risk of breast cancer into their decision about whether or
   not to continue a pregnancy.

   Countering the Anti-Choice Scare Tactics

   In January 1996, Christ's Bride Ministries, a pro-life organization,
   began running misleading advertisements in transit systems in several
   cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia and Chicago.
   These ads stated "women who choose abortion suffer more and deadlier
   breast cancer."

   The public health, reproductive rights and breast cancer advocacy
   communities all quickly responded. Dr. Philip Lee, assistant secretary
   of health in the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote a
   letter stating that the ad is unfortunately misleading, unduly
   alarming, and does not accurately reflect the weight of the scientific
   literature.? The National Cancer Institute issued a fact sheet
   asserting that the statements in the ad "misrepresent the information
   in the scientific literature." And the National Breast Cancer
   Coalition, a grassroots advocacy organization, published a position
   paper which stated that the current evidence of abortion's relationship
   to breast cancer is inconclusive and pointed out that "the abortion
   rate has been fairly constant since 1978, while breast cancer incidence
   continues to rise."

   When President Bush took office, however, suddenly the NCI removed the
   fact sheet from its website and replaced it with a statement that
   studies on this topic were inconclusive. Eventually, in response to
   overwhelming scientific consensus agreement that the evidence does not
   support a link, NCI posted a new and accurate fact sheet. This is one
   of many examples of the Bush administration's misuse, distortion or
   suppression of science for political ends.

   Other anti-choice activists have found additional ways to use this
   scare tactic on women. Several states have considered, and some have
   passed, legislation which requires clinicians to provide women seeking
   abortions with information about the alleged association with an
   increased risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer and reproductive rights
   activists are working to prevent the passage of laws requiring the
   dissemination of medically inaccurate information and to challenge
   states that disregard the evidence.

   Watch for Anti-Choice Scare Tactics in Your Community

   The National Women's Health Network is committed to ensuring that women
   have access to accurate, balanced information about abortion and breast
   cancer. Watch in your community for the scare tactics described here,
   and let us know what you find.
