How the "Internet of Things" May Change the World

Wireless connectivity of billions of objects offers many benefits--and risks.

   [124]National Geographic

   Published August 30, 2013

   This week, the Oxford English Dictionary added the phrase
   [125]"Internet of things" to its hallowed pages, along with such
   neologisms as Bitcoin (a virtual currency), selfie (a self-portrait
   photo), twerk (a new dance move), and fauxhawk (a mohawk hairstyle
   achieved with gel and a comb).

   But what exactly is the Internet of things, and how might the emerging
   technology change our lives?

   The Internet of things is a concept that aims to extend the benefits of
   the regular Internet--constant connectivity, remote control ability,
   data sharing, and so on--to goods in the physical world. Foodstuffs,
   electronics, appliances, collectibles: All would be tied to local and
   global networks through embedded sensors that are "always on."

   Sometimes called the "Internet of everything," the term Internet of
   things was coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, a British technology pioneer
   who helped develop the concept. Proponents say the benefits to
   consumers are substantial, although critics raise concerns about
   privacy and security.

   In order for objects to interface with the existing Internet, they must
   have some means to connect. This is being done largely via
   radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips, although other means are
   also being used, including old-fashioned barcodes, QR (quick response)
   codes, and wireless connection systems like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

   Ashton co-founded the [126]Auto-ID Center at the Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology in 1999, which developed a global standard
   for RFID. That technology grew out of earlier iterations invented in
   the 1970s and early 1980s.

   In the mid-1990s, Ashton worked for Procter & Gamble, where he saw that
   RFID chips could help the company keep track of its massive array of
   products. Today, RFID chips are used by many companies to manage their
   inventories. They also make passports scannable by Homeland Security,
   and enable farecards to be read at subway terminals. Farmers use the
   chips to keep track of livestock.

   In 2011, the world spent an estimated $6.37 billion on RFID chips, but
   that market is expected to balloon to more than $20 billion by 2014,
   [127]according to RFID World Canada, a website that follows the
   industry.

   ABI Research, a market research firm, says that more than 30 billion
   devices will form an Internet of things by 2020. But what does that
   mean?

   (Related: "[128]Smart Meters Take Bite Out of Electricity Theft.")

   Advantages of a Wired World

   Proponents like Helen Duce, director of the [129]RFID Technology
   Auto-ID European Centre at the University of Cambridge, argue that the
   technology will provide great efficiencies across many industries.
   Stores won't have to worry about running out of products, because an
   automated inventory-control system will know how many packs of gum or
   boxes of diapers are on hand at any given moment.

   Consumers will be able to set their fridge to order new groceries for
   delivery when the eggs run out or the milk expires. Forget to turn off
   the oven? No problem, turn a dial on your smartphone from anywhere in
   the world. No need to turn off the lights: Your rooms will know when
   you enter or leave, setting all systems just the way you like them,
   since they will be able to detect when the phone in your pocket is
   near.

   Already, consumers can save money, and carbon emissions, during peak
   energy periods by agreeing to let their utility turn down their air
   conditioner a few degrees remotely.

   Duce [130]recently wrote, "We have a clear vision--to create a world
   where every object--from jumbo jets to sewing needles--is linked to the
   Internet."

   In a push toward adoption of this technology, [131]Songdo in South
   Korea aims to become the first totally wired "smart city," where almost
   every item interfaces with an Internet of things. Planners hope to
   collect a vast wealth of data on everyday objects, and use that to
   increase efficiencies.

   Security Concerns?

   It's obvious that military agencies will need to make sure that
   missiles and other systems of war aren't hijacked by hackers. But what
   is the risk of your neighbor turning your toaster against you?

   The U.S. National Intelligence Council [132]produced a report in 2008
   that warned it would be hard to deny "access to networks of sensors and
   remotely controlled objects by enemies of the United States, criminals,
   and mischief makers."

   The report also noted that it's unclear how much of the data from the
   Internet of things could or should be used by law enforcement, versus
   how much should be considered private information.

   (See: "[133]Who's Watching? Privacy Concerns Persist as Smart Meters
   Roll Out.")

   Writing [134]in ITBusinessEdge, Loraine Lawson warned that an Internet
   of things will provide challenges for computer programmers, who will
   soon have the networking of billions of devices to contend with.
   Updates and patches are going to be tricky, she wrote, as will finding
   signals in all the noise.

   Lawson suggested that the solutions will have to come through smart,
   stable software that doesn't require too much processing power.

   "In short, the IoT (Internet of things) may cause a lot of headaches,
   but it could also prove to be very transformative for organizations,"
   she wrote.

   IeT is a reality. The naysayers are likely the same ones who thought
   the internet itself was a fad with a limited appeal. I think those that
   are raising issues about ethics and security are right on queue. We
   need to get a handle on those issues. We are all going to be connected.
   Yes, even us! I found this blog
   interesting: [141]http://chopra-m.blogspot.com/2013/03/are-you-thing-ye
   t-if-not-soon-you-will.html. There is a lot more information on some of
   these issues.

   I'm sorry, I just can't see a single positive thing about any of this.
   In fact, it could well be enough to motivate the individual to rip open
   their toasters and microwaves to find those little intrusive devices
   and send them out to the nearest landfill.

   I agree about the "Security Concerns". It can create potential issues
   with privacy and regulations.

   We know that Big Data is the only way to handle the volume and speed
   required for "Internet of Things" data collection and analysis, but
   many organizations have rushed into Big Data focused solely on ROI, and
   security is an afterthought.

   There is also a shortage in Big Data skills and an industry-wide
   shortage in data security personnel, so many organizations don't even
   know they are doing anything wrong from a security perspective.  The
   big differences with Big Data is that we are changing the way we are
   dealing with data.

   Collecting and processing a huge amount of data is now more feasible
   and cost effective with Big Data technology. Our IT teams are used to
   structure the data before loading it into traditional databases, but
   Big Data is different.

   I think that many organizations shortly will be struggling with a major
   big data barrier:

   1. I think a big data security crisis is likely to occur very soon and
   few organizations have the ability to deal with it.

   2. We have little knowledge about data loss or theft in big data
   environments.

   3. I imagine it is happening today but has not been disclosed to the
   public.

   The good news is that some organizations are proactive and successfully
   using new approaches to address issues with security and privacy in Big
   Data environments. These new security approaches are required since Big
   Data is based on new and different architecture. Big Data is very
   different - not like our traditional databases.

   I recently read an interesting report from Aberdeen Group that revealed
   that "Over the last 12 months, tokenization users had 50% fewer
   security-related incidents(e.g., unauthorized access, data loss or data
   exposure than tokenization non-users". The name of the study, released
   a few months ago, is "Tokenization Gets Traction".

       Hippopotamus defends territory from elephant, Chobe River, Botswana
       - Aug 2013 It was a battle of the giants when a hippo had a tetchy
       face-off with an elephant. The ellie had invaded the
       hippopotamus&#x27; territory on the Chobe River in Botswana and the
       angry hippo seemed keen to make its feelings clear. The heavyweight
       face-off was captured by Nicole Cambre, a 43-year-old lawyer and
       keen photographer from Brussels. Her pictures show the elephant
       proudly standing on an island in the river, while the submerged
       hippo approaches through the water. When the hippo gets onto the
       island it does its best to intimidate the unwelcome guest by
       widening its jaws and bearing teeth. The elephant lowers its head
       but the battle is over before it has begun as more elephants arrive
       and the hippo backs off. Nicole explains: There is an island on the
       middle of the Chobe River to which this elephant had crossed. The
       hippo was not happy about it and was apparently defending its
       territory. When more elephants crossed the river to the island the
       hippo backed off and went back into the river.&quot; [199]Hippo vs.
