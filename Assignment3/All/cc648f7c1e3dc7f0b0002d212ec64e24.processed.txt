Tomorrow's Food, Today: 3 Opportunities for Disruption of the Industrial Food
System

   It's a waste of words to spend time writing about how broken our food
   system is. For anyone who cares to find out, it's not difficult to
   uproot articles and research about polluted waterways caused by
   fertilizer runoff, "pink slime," the obesity epidemic, food deserts,
   harmful growth hormones in our meat, the "carbon footprint" of food
   transportation, millions of pounds of food going to waste [40]every
   year, and more.

   These problems, further complicated by the political and social climate
   surrounding the food production system, have not gone unnoticed.

   Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have realized that an opportunity
   to change the way we produce, transport, process, and consume food
   exists. According to [41]The New York Times, venture funding to food
   tech startups is higher than ever before, to the tune of $350 million
   in the last year.

   But food tech startups, especially at the consumer level, have yet to
   prove themselves profitable or permeating, despite the dire need for
   innovation in our food system and despite the gargantuan market
   potential for entrepreneurs (everyone eats, after all). There are
   several reasons that investment in food technology is currently going
   to waste.

   First and foremost, the rhetoric surrounding the so-called "food
   movement" invokes a certain nostalgia for the days before technology
   entered our food system, before GPS-enabled tractors, before
   genetically engineered organisms, and before large scale processing
   techniques.

   It's difficult for companies with a good product and a solid business
   plan to scale when "processed" food is a bad word and "technology" has
   become the villain in this Neo-Luddism era of Slow Food. As the New
   York Times notes, "The movement[...] is decidedly low-tech."

   Secondly, the consumer-facing tech products that are coming out are
   geared at a more informed, more affluent audience, not the mainstream.
   They often require significant behavior change in order to achieve
   widespread adoption, and it's hard to get even the folks who can afford
   it to change their eating and buying habits in any radical way.

   That's why fundamental change in our food system has to happen in the
   actual machinery of the system -- the harvesting, the processing, the
   transportation. Venture capital and entrepreneurial efforts are
   currently misguided and should be refocused on the system as a whole,
   where they will have the most impact on the food system (and,
   consequently, will see the greatest pay-off).

   Three of the most promising technologies that are being developed in
   the here and now to reinvent the way we produce food include
   large-scale vertical farming coupled with aquaponics and/or
   hydroponics; algae production and cultivation for fertilizer, as well
   as for nutrient/protein consumption (for animals and humans); and
   finally, entomophagy.

   Food in the City: Growing Up

   Companies like [42]Plantagon in Sweden are designing futuristic
   "skyscraper farms" meant to feed an urban population from within a
   city's borders. [43]Farmiculture, based in Phoenix, is meanwhile
   turning commercial warehouses into vertical hydroponic greenhouses,
   maximizing space and resources and eliminating the need for tractors,
   intensive tilling, and expensive and wasteful irrigation systems.

   When done well, both large-scale vertical farming and hydroponics has
   proven to be more productive and diverse, [44]less wasteful, and
   extremely energy and resource efficient. Even better, produce can be
   grown year-round and crops are more resistant to climate change and
   other weather-related factors that conventional farmers face.

   Leafy greens, tomatoes, herbs, and peppers can be raised in close
   proximity to the retailers who will stock the vegetables in their
   grocery stores and restaurants, assuaging some of the cost of
   transportation, both to the farmer and to the environment. The plants
   in these systems grow much more quickly because they are not exposed to
   the stress caused by being under or over-watered or having to struggle
   in suboptimal conditions.

   Vertical farms and hydroponics (vertical or otherwise) are a
   win-win-win solution for the farmers (who can cut costs on water and
   fertilizer), the consumers (who can buy affordable, fresh produce
   year-round) and the environment. Aquaponics systems use 70% to 90% less
   water than conventional irrigation techniques.

   The Algae Band-Aid: Biofertilizer

   Large-scale algae cultivation for biofuels and other high-value
   products already exists at scale, but the latest application for algae
   comes from the leftover biomass of the "de-oiling" process.

   The leftover mass is nutrient- and energy-rich and makes for an organic
   and environmentally safe biofertilizer that's able to compete (in terms
   of yield/acre) with the chemical fertilizers responsible for such
   environmental damage such as the "dead zone" in the Gulf of Mexico and
   the loss of biodiversity (and therefore, productivity) in the soil.

   In a [45]study performed at the University of Texas at Austin,
   algae-based fertilizer showed higher crop yields than traditional
   chemical fertilizers, another win for farmers who have to meet their
   bottom line.

   Biofertilizers also reinforce soil nutrients and they encourage
   microbiological diversity in the soil. These are obvious boons to the
   environment, but they also have long-term economic benefits as well.
   Good soil is good for yield is good for business.

   Right now, the upfront cost of growing algae and producing fertilizers
   is high as research and development are still going into commercial
   biofertilizers, but as the technology proves itself out, prices will
   fall as the short- and long-term benefits are realized.

   Eating Insects

   Grasshopper cookies and cricket protein bars could soon be making an
   appearance at your local grocery store or farmer's market. And you
   should buy them.

   Bugs are plentiful, cheap to produce, inexpensive to feed, high in
   protein, iron, and calcium, low in saturated fat, and require very
   little water or space. And they're already being produced at scale to
   feed the pet chameleons and bearded dragons of American households.

   For all of those reasons, insects are an affordable source of protein
   (which 80% of the world already consumes) and far better for the
   environment, and our health, than red meat.

   In fact, it's not a new idea. Startups are already jumping (squirming,
   hopping?) at the market opportunity. The technology to raise and
   harvest crickets at scale already exists. Companies like [46]Chirp and
   [47]Chapul are producing organic cricket flour for protein bars and
   baked goods. Restaurants like [48]Antojeria Popular in New York serve
   crickets disguised as tostadas and [49]Don Bugito, a mobile street food
   vendor in San Francisco, cooks up Spicy Superworms.

   And we already eat weird things. Escargot, lobsters, fish roe -- are
   grasshoppers really that big of a leap? And yet, there's still a major
   barrier to entry for entomophagy. Western psychology tells us that bugs
   are icky, dirty, and for squashing, not cooking.

   Luckily, there's already a solution to psychological barriers to new
   products -- good marketing. Insect startups should be funneling their
   investment funds into their marketing departments, partnering with
   innovative chefs, holding tastings, designing appealing packaging, and
   holding cooking classes and educational workshops.

   If consumers are properly primed, by the time concerns about our food
   system and our health reach a tipping point in the next ten years (or
   sooner), grasshopper spring rolls and mealworm stir fry will be seen as
   a sustainable alternative to beef, poultry, and pork.

   Next Steps

   Before these technologies can take hold, we first have to change the
   way we think about food and food production.

   On the most fundamental level, we have to be comfortable with
   redefining the very concept of food itself. If it was never actually
   living, is it still meat? Can it be produce if it wasn't grown in the
   ground?

   That's the first step.

   Then, we have to overcome the local vs. industrial rhetoric to realize
   that sustainable solutions will likely be a combination of the two.

   Finally, we need to help producers overcome the high upfront capital
   costs of food technology. This will happen when universities, large
   cash-rich food corporations, and venture capitalists realize that
   investments in early stage food technology research will have a high
   pay off in the long-run.

   The answer will lie in the win-win-win innovations -- good for the
   producer, good for the consumer, and good for the environment.

   By day, Brittany Smith brings early-stage technologies to market at
   Jones-Dilworth, Inc. At night, she writes frequently about the rhetoric
   of local food systems and food technology, hoping to one day redefine
   the way we process, distribute and eat food. To continue the
