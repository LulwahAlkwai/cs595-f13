   Samurai (^[26]?), usually referred to in Japanese as bushi (¦«^[27]?,
   [28][bu.i<o>]) or buke (¦¶^[29]?), were the military nobility of
   medieval and early-modern [30]Japan. According to translator
   [31]William Scott Wilson: "In Chinese, the character was originally a
   verb meaning to wait upon or accompany persons in the upper ranks of
   society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese,
   [32]saburau. In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean
   "those who serve in close attendance to the nobility," the
   pronunciation in Japanese changing to [33]saburai. According to Wilson,
   an early reference to the word "samurai" appears in the [34]Kokin
   Wakashu (905-914), the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in
   the first part of the 10th century.^[35][1]

   By the end of the 12th century, samurai became almost entirely
   synonymous with bushi, and the word was closely associated with the
   middle and upper echelons of the warrior class. The samurai followed a
   set of rules that came to be known as [36]bushido. While the samurai
   numbered less than 10% of Japan's population,^[37][2] their teachings
   can still be found today in both everyday life and in modern
   [38]Japanese martial arts.

History

Asuka and Nara periods

   century. [40]Tokyo National Museum.

   Following the [41]Battle of Hakusukinoe against [42]Tang [43]China and
   [44]Silla in 663 AD that led to a Japanese retreat from Korean affairs,
   Japan underwent widespread reform. One of the most important was that
   of the [45]Taika Reform, issued by Prince Naka no Oe ([46]Emperor
   Tenji) in 646 AD. This edict allowed the Japanese aristocracy to adopt
   the [47]Tang Dynasty political structure, [48]bureaucracy, culture,
   religion, and philosophy.^[49][3] As part of the [50]Taiho Code, of 702
   AD, and the later [51]Yoro Code,^[52][4] the population was required to
   report regularly for census, a precursor for national conscription.
   With an understanding of how the population was distributed,
   [53]Emperor Mommu introduced a law whereby 1 in 3-4 adult males was
   drafted into the national military. These soldiers were required to
   supply their own weapons, and in return were exempted from duties and
   taxes.^[54][3] This was one of the first attempts by the Imperial
   government to form an organized army modeled after the Chinese system.
   It was called "Gundan-Sei" (£¶) by later historians and is believed to
   have been short-lived.^[[55]citation needed]

   The Taiho Code classified most of the Imperial bureaucrats into 12
   ranks, each divided into two sub-ranks, 1st rank being the highest
   adviser to the Emperor. Those of 6th rank and below were referred to as
   "samurai" and dealt with day-to-day affairs. Although these "samurai"
   were civilian public servants, the name is believed^[[56]by whom?] to
   have derived from this term. Military men, however, would not be
   referred to as "samurai" for many more centuries.^[[57]citation needed]

Heian period

   In the early [58]Heian period, the late 8th and early 9th centuries,
   [59]Emperor Kammu sought to consolidate and expand his rule in northern
   [60]Honshu, but the armies he sent to conquer the rebellious [61]Emishi
   people lacked motivation and discipline, and failed in their
   task.^[[62]citation needed] Emperor Kammu introduced the title of
   sei'i-taishogun (·§) or [63]Shogun, and began to rely on the powerful
   regional clans to conquer the Emishi. Skilled in mounted combat and
   [64]archery ([65]kyudo), these clan warriors became the Emperor's
   preferred tool for putting down rebellions.^[[66]citation needed]
   Though this is the first known use of the "Shogun" title, it was a
   temporary title, and was not imbued with political power until the 13th
   century. At this time (the 7th to 9th century) the Imperial Court
   officials considered them merely a military section under the control
   of the Imperial Court.

   Ultimately, Emperor Kammu disbanded his army. From this time, the
   emperor's power gradually declined. While the emperor was still the
   ruler, powerful clans around [67]Kyoto (¬½) assumed positions as
   ministers, and their relatives bought positions as magistrates. To
   amass wealth and repay their debts, magistrates often imposed heavy
   taxes, resulting in many farmers becoming landless.^[[68]citation
   needed]

   ([70]yumi) and arrows in a [71]yebira quiver

   Through protective agreements and political marriages, they
   accumulated, or gathered, political power, eventually surpassing the
   traditional aristocracy.^[[72]citation needed]

   Some clans were originally formed by farmers who had taken up arms to
   protect themselves from the Imperial magistrates sent to govern their
   lands and collect taxes. These clans formed alliances to protect
   themselves against more powerful clans, and by the mid-Heian period
   they had adopted characteristic [73]Japanese armor and weapons, and
   laid the foundations of [74]Bushido, their ethical code.^[[75]citation
   needed]

   After the [76]Genpei war of the late 12th century, a clan leader
   [77]Minamoto no Yoritomo obtained the right to appoint [78]shugo and
   [79]jito, and was allowed to organize soldiers and police, and to
   collect a certain amount of tax. Initially, their responsibility was
   restricted to arresting rebels and collecting needed army provisions,
   and they were forbidden from interfering with [80]Kokushi Governors,
   but their responsibility gradually expanded and thus the samurai-class
   appeared as the political ruling power in Japan. [81]Minamoto no
   Yoritomo opened the [82]Kamakura Bakufu Shogunate in 1192.

Kamakura Bakufu and the rise of samurai

   Museum.

   Originally the emperor and nobility employed these warriors. In time,
   they amassed enough manpower, resources and political backing in the
   form of alliances with one another, to establish the first
   samurai-dominated government. As the power of these regional clans
   grew, their chief was typically a distant relative of the emperor and a
   lesser member of either the [86]Fujiwara, [87]Minamoto, or [88]Taira
   clans. Though originally sent to provincial areas for a fixed four-year
   term as a magistrate, the toryo declined to return to the capital when
   their terms ended, and their sons inherited their positions and
   continued to lead the clans in putting down rebellions throughout Japan
   during the middle- and later-Heian period. Because of their rising
   military and economic power, the warriors ultimately became a new force
   in the politics of the court. Their involvement in the [89]Hogen in the
   late Heian period consolidated their power, and finally pitted the
   rival [90]Minamoto and [91]Taira clans against each other in the
   [92]Heiji Rebellion of 1160.

   The winner, [93]Taira no Kiyomori, became an imperial advisor, and was
   the first warrior to attain such a position. He eventually seized
   control of the central government, establishing the first
   samurai-dominated government and relegating the emperor to figurehead
   status. However, the Taira clan was still very conservative when
   compared to its eventual successor, the Minamoto, and instead of
   expanding or strengthening its military might, the clan had its women
   marry emperors and exercise control through the emperor.

   The Taira and the Minamoto clashed again in 1180, beginning the
   [94]Gempei War, which ended in 1185. Samurai fought at the naval
   [95]battle of Dan-no-ura, at the Shimonoseki Strait which separates
   Honshu and Kyushu in 1185. The victorious [96]Minamoto no Yoritomo
   established the superiority of the samurai over the aristocracy. In
   1190 he visited Kyoto and in 1192 became [97]Sei'i-taishogun,
   establishing the Kamakura Shogunate, or Kamakura Bakufu. Instead of
   ruling from Kyoto, he set up the Shogunate in [98]Kamakura, near his
   base of power. "Bakufu" means "tent government", taken from the
   encampments the soldiers would live in, in accordance with the Bakufu's
   status as a military government.^[99][5]

   Over time, powerful samurai clans became warrior nobility, or "buke",
   who were only nominally under the court aristocracy. When the samurai
   began to adopt aristocratic pastimes like [100]calligraphy, poetry and
   music, some court aristocrats in turn began to adopt samurai customs.
   Despite machinations and brief periods of rule by emperors, real power
   was then in the hands of the Shogun and the samurai.

Ashikaga Shogunate

   Various samurai clans struggled for power during the [103]Kamakura and
   [104]Ashikaga Shogunates. [105]Zen Buddhism spread among the samurai in
   the 13th century and helped to shape their standards of conduct,
   particularly overcoming fear of death and killing, but among the
   general populace, [106]Pure Land Buddhism was favored.

   In 1274, the Mongol-founded [107]Yuan Dynasty in [108]China sent a
   force of some 40,000 men and 900 ships to invade Japan in northern
   [109]Kyushu. Japan mustered a mere 10,000 samurai to meet this threat.
   The invading army was harassed by major thunderstorms throughout the
   [110]invasion, which aided the defenders by inflicting heavy
   casualties. The Yuan army was eventually recalled and the invasion was
   called off. The Mongol invaders used small [111]bombs, which was likely
   the first appearance of bombs and [112]gunpowder in Japan.

   The Japanese defenders recognized the possibility of a renewed
   invasion, and began construction of a [113]great stone barrier around
   [114]Hakata Bay in 1276. Completed in 1277, this wall stretched for 20
   kilometers around the border of the bay. This would later serve as a
   strong defensive point against the Mongols. The Mongols attempted to
   settle matters in a diplomatic way from 1275 to 1279, but every envoy
   sent to Japan was executed. This set the stage for one of the most
   famous engagements in Japanese history.

   In 1281, a Yuan army of 140,000 men with 5,000 ships was mustered for
   another invasion of Japan. Northern Kyushu was defended by a Japanese
   army of 40,000 men. The Mongol army was still on its ships preparing
   for the landing operation when a typhoon hit north Kyushu island. The
   casualties and damage inflicted by the typhoon, followed by the
   Japanese defense of the Hakata Bay barrier, resulted in the Mongols
   again recalling their armies.

   The thunderstorms of 1274 and the typhoon of 1281 helped the samurai
   defenders of Japan repel the Mongol invaders despite being vastly
   outnumbered. These winds became known as kami-no-kaze, which literally
   translates as "wind of the gods." This is often given a simplified
   translation as "divine wind." The kami-no-kaze lent credence to the
   Japanese belief that their lands were indeed divine and under
   supernatural protection.

   In the 14th century, a blacksmith called [116]Masamune developed a
   two-layer structure of soft and hard steel for use in swords. This
   structure gave much improved cutting power and endurance, and the
   production technique led to Japanese swords ([117]katana) being
   recognized as some of the most potent hand weapons of pre-industrial
   [118]East Asia. Many swords made using this technique were exported
   across the [119]East China Sea, a few making their way as far as
   [120]India.

   Issues of inheritance caused family strife as [122]primogeniture became
   common, in contrast to the division of succession designated by law
   before the 14th century. To avoid infighting, invasions of neighboring
   samurai territories became common and bickering among samurai was a
   constant problem for the [123]Kamakura and [124]Ashikaga Shogunates.

Sengoku period

   The [125]Sengoku jidai ("warring-states period") was marked by the
   loosening of samurai culture with people born into other social strata
   sometimes making names for themselves as warriors and thus becoming
   [126]de facto samurai. In this turbulent period, [127]bushido ethics
   became important factors in controlling and maintaining public order.

   Japanese war tactics and technologies improved rapidly in the 15th and
   16th century. Use of large numbers of infantry called [128]ashigaru
   ("light-foot," due to their light armor), formed of humble warriors or
   ordinary people with nagayari (a long [129]lance) or ([130]naginata),
   was introduced and combined with cavalry in maneuvers. The number of
   people mobilized in warfare ranged from thousands to hundreds of
   thousands.
   [131]Nanban (Western)-style samurai [132]cuirass, 16th century

   The [133]arquebus, a [134]matchlock gun, was introduced by the
   [135]Portuguese via a Chinese [136]pirate ship in 1543 and the Japanese
   succeeded in assimilating it within a decade. Groups of mercenaries
   with mass-produced [137]arquebuses began playing a critical role. By
   the end of the Sengoku Period, several hundred thousand firearms
   existed in Japan and massive armies numbering over 100,000 clashed in
   battles.

Azuchi-Momoyama period

   In 1592, and again in 1597, [138]Toyotomi Hideyoshi decided to invade
   [139]China (¥ri) through [140]Korea and mobilized an army of 160,000
   peasants and samurai.(See [141]Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea,
   Chosen-seibatsu (®^[142]?). Taking advantage of its mastery of the
   arquebus, Japanese samurai made major gains in most of Korea. Kato
   Kiyomasa advanced to Orangkai (present northeastern region of China)
   and crossed the Korean border, but withdrew when it was clear he had
   outpaced the rest of the Japanese invasion force. A few of the more
   famous samurai generals of this war were [143]Kato Kiyomasa,
   [144]Konishi Yukinaga, and [145]Shimazu Yoshihiro. Shimazu Yoshihiro
   led 7,000 Samurai and defeated the tens of thousands of soldiers of
   Ming and Korean allied Forces at the [146]Battle of Sacheon in 1598.
   Yoshihiro was feared as Oni-Shimazu ("Shimazu ogre") and his nickname
   spread across not only Korea but to Ming Dynasty China.

   Social mobility was high, as the ancient regime collapsed and emerging
   samurai needed to maintain large military and administrative
   organizations in their areas of influence. Most of the samurai families
   that survived to the 19th century originated in this era, declaring
   themselves to be the blood of one of the four ancient noble clans:
   [147]Minamoto, [148]Taira, [149]Fujiwara and [150]Tachibana. In most
   cases, however, it is hard to prove these claims.

Oda, Toyotomi and Tokugawa

   The Samurai [151]Hasekura Tsunenaga in Rome in 1615, Coll. Borghese,
   [152]Rome.

   [153]Oda Nobunaga was the well-known lord of the [154]Nagoya area (once
   called [155]Owari Province) and an exceptional example of a samurai of
   the [156]Sengoku Period. He came within a few years of, and laid down
   the path for his successors to follow, the reunification of Japan under
   a new Bakufu (Shogunate).

   Oda Nobunaga made innovations in the fields of organization and war
   tactics, heavily used arquebuses, developed commerce and industry and
   treasured innovation. Consecutive victories enabled him to realize the
   termination of the Ashikaga Bakufu and the disarmament of the military
   powers of the Buddhist monks, which had inflamed futile struggles among
   the populace for centuries. Attacking from the "sanctuary" of Buddhist
   temples, they were constant headaches to any warlord and even the
   emperor who tried to control their actions. He died in 1582 when one of
   his generals, [157]Akechi Mitsuhide, turned upon him with his army.

   Importantly, [158]Toyotomi Hideyoshi (see below) and [159]Tokugawa
   Ieyasu, who founded the Tokugawa Shogunate, were loyal followers of
   Nobunaga. Hideyoshi began as a nameless peasant and became one of
   Nobunaga's top generals, and Ieyasu had shared his childhood with
   Nobunaga. Hideyoshi defeated Mitsuhide within a month, and was regarded
   as the rightful successor of Nobunaga by avenging the treachery of
   Mitsuhide.

   These two were gifted with Nobunaga's previous achievements on which
   build a unified Japan and there was a saying: "The reunification is a
   rice cake; Oda made it. Hashiba shaped it. At last, only Ieyasu tastes
   it."^[[160]citation needed] (Hashiba is the family name that Toyotomi
   Hideyoshi used while he was a follower of Nobunaga.)

   [161]Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who became a grand minister in 1586, himself
   the son of a poor peasant family, created a law that the samurai caste
   became codified as permanent and hereditary, and that non-samurai were
   forbidden to carry weapons, thereby ending the social mobility of Japan
   up until that point, which lasted until the dissolution of the Edo
   Shogunate by the Meiji revolutionaries.

   It is important to note that the distinction between samurai and
   non-samurai was so obscure that during the 16th century, most male
   adults in any social class (even small farmers) belonged to at least
   one military organization of their own and served in wars before and
   during Hideyoshi's rule. It can be said that an "all against all"
   situation continued for a century.

   The authorized samurai families after the 17th century were those that
   chose to follow Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu. Large battles occurred
   during the change between regimes, and a number of defeated samurai
   were destroyed, went [162]ronin or were absorbed into the general
   populace.

Tokugawa Shogunate

   [163]Miyamoto Musashi, [164]Self-portrait, Ronin, writer and artist, c.
   1640

   During the [165]Tokugawa shogunate, samurai increasingly became
   courtiers, bureaucrats, and administrators rather than warriors. With
   no warfare since the early 17th century, samurai gradually lost their
   military function during the [166]Tokugawa era (also called the
   [167]Edo period). By the end of the Tokugawa era, samurai were
   aristocratic bureaucrats for the [168]daimyo, with their [169]daisho,
   the paired long and short swords of the samurai (cf. [170]katana and
   [171]wakizashi) becoming more of a symbolic emblem of power rather than
   a weapon used in daily life. They still had the legal right to cut down
   any [172]commoner who did not show proper respect [173]kiri-sute gomen
   (¬ri¨te¡^[174]?), but to what extent this right was used is unknown.
   When the central government forced daimyos to cut the size of their
   armies, unemployed [175]ronin became a social problem.

   Theoretical obligations between a samurai and his lord (usually a
   daimyo) increased from the Genpei era to the Edo era. They were
   strongly emphasized by the teachings of [176]Confucius and [177]Mencius
   (ca 550 BC), which were required reading for the educated samurai
   class. Bushido was formalized by several influential leaders and
   families before the Edo Period. Bushido was an ideal, and it remained
   fairly uniform from the 13th century to the 19th century -- the ideals
   of Bushido transcended social class, time and geographic location of
   the warrior class.

   [178]Bushido was formalized by samurai such as Imagawa Ryoshun as early
   as the 13th century. The conduct of samurai served as role model
   behavior for the other social classes. With time on their hands,
   samurai spent more time in pursuit of other interests such as becoming
   scholars.

Modernization

   Main article: [179]Late Tokugawa shogunate

   Samurai with sword, ca. 1860.

   The relative peace of the Tokugawa era was shattered with the arrival
   of Commodore [181]Matthew Perry's massive U.S. Navy steamships in 1853.
   Perry used his superior firepower to force Japan to open its borders to
   trade. Prior to that only a few harbor towns, under strict control from
   the Shogunate, were allowed to participate in Western trade, and even
   then, it was based largely on the idea of playing the [182]Franciscans
   and [183]Dominicans off against one another (in exchange for the
   crucial [184]arquebus technology, which in turn was a major contributor
   to the downfall of the classical samurai).

   From 1854, the samurai army and the navy were modernized. A [185]Naval
   training school was established in [186]Nagasaki in 1855. Naval
   students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years,
   starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as
   Admiral [187]Enomoto. French naval engineers were hired to build naval
   arsenals, such as [188]Yokosuka and [189]Nagasaki. By the end of the
   Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Japanese navy of the [190]shogun
   already possessed eight western-style steam warships around the
   flagship [191]Kaiyo Maru, which were used against pro-imperial forces
   during the [192]Boshin war, under the command of Admiral [193]Enomoto.
   A [194]French Military Mission to Japan (1867) was established to help
   modernize the armies of the [195]Bakufu.

   The last showing of the original samurai was in 1867 when samurai from
   [196]Choshu and [197]Satsuma provinces defeated the Shogunate forces in
   favor of the rule of the emperor in the [198]Boshin War (1868-1869).
   The two provinces were the lands of the daimyo that submitted to Ieyasu
   after the [199]Battle of Sekigahara (1600).

Decline

   [206]Saigo Takamori (upper right, in Western uniform) directing his
   troops, some of them in traditional samurai armor, at the [207]Battle
   of Shiroyama.

   [208]Emperor Meiji abolished the samurai's right to be the only armed
   force in favor of a more modern, western-style, conscripted army in
   1873. Samurai became [209]Shizoku («) who retained some of their
   salaries, but the right to wear a katana in public was eventually
   abolished along with the right to [210]execute commoners who paid them
   disrespect. The samurai finally came to an end after hundreds of years
   of enjoyment of their status, their powers, and their ability to shape
   the government of Japan. However, the rule of the state by the military
   class was not yet over. In defining how a modern Japan should be,
   members of the Meiji government decided to follow the footsteps of the
   [211]United Kingdom and [212]Germany, basing the country on the concept
   of [213]noblesse oblige. Samurai were not a political force under the
   new order. With the [214]Meiji reforms in the late 19th century, the
   samurai class was abolished, and a western-style national army was
   established. The Imperial Japanese Armies were conscripted, but many
   samurai volunteered as soldiers, and many advanced to be trained as
   officers. Much of the Imperial Army officer class was of samurai
   origin, and were highly motivated, disciplined, and exceptionally
   trained.

   The last samurai conflict was arguably in 1877, during the [215]Satsuma
   Rebellion in the [216]Battle of Shiroyama. This conflict had its
   genesis in the previous uprising to defeat the Tokugawa Shogunate,
   leading to the Meiji Restoration. The newly formed government
   instituted radical changes, aimed at reducing the power of the feudal
   domains, including Satsuma, and the dissolution of samurai status. This
   led to the ultimately premature uprising, led by [217]Saigo Takamori.

   Samurai were many of the early exchange students, not directly because
   they were samurai, but because many samurai were literate and
   well-educated scholars. Some of these exchange students started private
   schools for higher educations, while many samurai took pens instead of
   guns and became reporters and writers, setting up newspaper companies,
   and others entered governmental service.

   Only the name Shizoku existed after that. After Japan lost [218]World
   War II, the name Shizoku disappeared under the law on 1 January 1947.

Philosophy

Religious influences

   The philosophies of [219]Buddhism and [220]Zen, and to a lesser extent
   [221]Confucianism and [222]Shinto, influenced the samurai culture. Zen
   meditation became an important teaching due to it offering a process to
   calm one's mind. The Buddhist concept of [223]reincarnation and
   [224]rebirth led samurai to abandon torture and needless killing, while
   some samurai even gave up violence altogether and became Buddhist monks
   after realizing how fruitless their killings were. Some were killed as
   they came to terms with these realizations in the battlefield. The most
   defining role that [225]Confucianism played in samurai philosophy was
   to stress the importance of the lord-retainer relationship--the loyalty
   that a samurai was required to show his lord.

   [228]Bushido ("way of the warrior") was a term that began to appear in
   intellectual and nationalist discourse after the [229]Japanese defeat
   of China in 1895 and [230]of Russia in 1905.^[231][6] [232]Hagakure or
   "Hidden in Leaves" by [233]Yamamoto Tsunetomo and Gorin no Sho or "Book
   of the Five Rings" by Miyamoto Musashi, both written in the Tokugawa
   period (1603-1868), are theories often associated with Bushido and Zen
   philosophy.

   The philosophies of [234]Buddhism and [235]Zen, and to a lesser extent
   [236]Confucianism and [237]Shinto, are attributed to the development of
   the samurai culture. "The notion that Zen is somehow related to
   Japanese culture in general, and bushido in particular, is familiar to
   Western students of Zen through the writings of D. T. Suzuki, no doubt
   the single most important figure in the spread of Zen in the
   West."^[238][7]

   In an account of Japan sent to Father [239]Ignatius Loyola at Rome,
   drawn from the statements of Anger (Han-Siro's western name), Xavier
   describes the importance of honor to the Japanese (Letter preserved at
   College of Coimbra.):

     In the first place, the nation with which we have had to do here
     surpasses in goodness any of the nations lately discovered. I really
     think that among barbarous nations there can be none that has more
     natural goodness than the Japanese. They are of a kindly
     disposition, not at all given to cheating, wonderfully desirous of
     honour and rank. Honour with them is placed above everything else.
     There are a great many poor among them, but poverty is not a
     disgrace to any one. There is one thing among them of which I hardly
     know whether it is practised anywhere among Christians. The nobles,
     however poor they may be, receive the same honour from the rest as
     if they were rich.^[240][8]

Doctrine

   Samurai warriors described themselves as followers of "The Way of the
   Warrior" or Bushido. [241]Bushido is defined by the Japanese dictionary
   [242]Shogakukan Kokugo Daijiten as "a unique philosophy (ronri) that
   spread through the warrior class from the Muromachi (chusei) period.
   From the earliest times, the Samurai felt that the path of the warrior
   was one of honor, emphasizing duty to one's master, and loyalty unto
   death".^[243][9]

   In the 13th century, [244]Hojo Shigetoki (1198-1261 AD) wrote: "When
   one is serving officially or in the master's court, he should not think
   of a hundred or a thousand people, but should consider only the
   importance of the master."^[245][10] [246]Carl Steenstrup noted that
   13th and 14th century warrior writings (gunki) "portrayed the bushi in
   their natural element, war, eulogizing such virtues as reckless
   bravery, fierce family pride, and selfless, at times senseless devotion
   of master and man."^[247][11] Feudal lords such as Shiba Yoshimasa
   (1350-1410 AD) stated that a warrior looked forward to a glorious death
   in the service of a military leader or the emperor: "It is a matter of
   regret to let the moment when one should die pass by....First, a man
   whose profession is the use of arms should think and then act upon not
   only his own fame, but also that of his descendants. He should not
   scandalize his name forever by holding his one and only life too
   dear....One's main purpose in throwing away his life is to do so either
   for the sake of the Emperor or in some great undertaking of a military
   general. It is that exactly that will be the great fame of one's
   descendants."^[248][12]
   General Akashi Gidayu preparing to commit [249]Seppuku after losing a
   battle for his master in 1582. He had just written his [250]death poem

   In 1412 AD, [251]Imagawa Sadayo wrote a letter of admonishment to his
   brother stressing the importance of duty to one's master. Imagawa was
   admired for his balance of military and administrative skills during
   his lifetime and his writings became widespread. The letters became
   central to Tokugawa-era laws and were a required study for traditional
   Japanese until World War II^[[252]citation needed]:

   "First of all, a samurai who dislikes battle and has not put his heart
   in the right place even though he has been born in the house of the
   warrior, should not be reckoned among one's retainers....It is
   forbidden to forget the great debt of kindness one owes to his master
   and ancestors and thereby make light of the virtues of loyalty and
   filial piety....It is forbidden that one should...attach little
   importance to his duties to his master...There is a primary need to
   distinguish loyalty from disloyalty and to establish rewards and
   punishments."^[253][13]

   Similarly, the feudal lord [254]Takeda Nobushige (1525-1561 AD) stated:
   "In matters both great and small, one should not turn his back on his
   master's commands...One should not ask for gifts or enfiefments from
   the master...No matter how unreasonably the master may treat a man, he
   should not feel disgruntled...An underling does not pass judgments on a
   superior"^[255][14]

   Nobushige's brother [256]Takeda Shingen (1521-1573 AD) also made
   similar observations: "One who was born in the house of a warrior,
   regardless of his rank or class, first acquaints himself with a man of
   military feats and achievements in loyalty....Everyone knows that if a
   man doesn't hold filial piety toward his own parents he would also
   neglect his duties toward his lord. Such a neglect means a disloyalty
   toward humanity. Therefore such a man doesn't deserve to be called
   'samurai'."^[257][15]

   The feudal lord [258]Asakura Yoshikage (1428-1481 AD) wrote: "In the
   fief of the Asakura, one should not determine hereditary chief
   retainers. A man should be assigned according to his ability and
   loyalty." Asakura also observed that the successes of his father were
   obtained by the kind treatment of the warriors and common people living
   in domain. By his civility, "all were willing to sacrifice their lives
   for him and become his allies."^[259][16]

   [260]Kato Kiyomasa was one of the most powerful and well-known lords of
   the Sengoku Era. He commanded most of Japan's major clans during the
   invasion of Korea (1592-1598). In a handbook he addressed to "all
   samurai, regardless of rank" he told his followers that a warrior's
   only duty in life was to "...grasp the long and the short swords and to
   die." He also ordered his followers to put forth great effort in
   studying the military classics, especially those related to loyalty and
   filial piety. He is best known for his quote:^[261][17] "If a man does
   not investigate into the matter of Bushido daily, it will be difficult
   for him to die a brave and manly death. Thus it is essential to engrave
   this business of the warrior into one's mind well."

   [262]Nabeshima Naoshige (1538-1618 AD) was another Sengoku Daimyo who
   fought alongside Kato Kiyomasa in Korea. He stated that it was shameful
   for any man to have not risked his life at least once in the line of
   duty, regardless of his rank. Nabeshima's sayings would be passed down
   to his son and grandson and would become the basis for [263]Tsunetomo
   Yamamoto's [264]Hagakure. He is best known for his saying "The way of
   the Samurai is in desperateness. Ten men or more cannot kill such a
   man."^[265][18]^[266][19]
   [267]Battle of Kawanakajima in 1561

   [268]Torii Mototada (1539-1600) was a feudal lord in the service of
   Tokugawa Ieyasu. On the eve of the battle of [269]Sekigahara, he
   volunteered to remain behind in the doomed [270]Fushimi Castle while
   his lord advanced to the east. Torii and Tokugawa both agreed that the
   castle was indefensible. In an act of loyalty to his lord, Torii chose
   to remain behind, pledging that he and his men would fight to the
   finish. As was custom, Torii vowed that he would not be taken alive. In
   a dramatic last stand, the garrison of 2,000 men held out against
   overwhelming odds for ten days against the massive army of Ishida
   Mitsunari's 40,000 warriors. In a moving [271]last statement to his son
   Tadamasa, he wrote:^[272][20]

   "It is not the Way of the Warrior [i.e., bushido] to be shamed and
   avoid death even under circumstances that are not particularly
   important. It goes without saying that to sacrifice one's life for the
   sake of his master is an unchanging principle. That I should be able to
   go ahead of all the other warriors of this country and lay down my life
   for the sake of my master's benevolence is an honor to my family and
   has been my most fervent desire for many years."

   It is said that both men cried when they parted ways, because they knew
   they would never see each other again. Torii's father and grandfather
   had served the Tokugawa before him and his own brother had already been
   killed in battle. Torii's actions changed the course of Japanese
   history. Ieyasu Tokugawa would successfully raise an army and win at
   [273]Sekigahara.

   The translator of Hagakure, [274]William Scott Wilson observed examples
   of warrior emphasis on death in clans other than Yamamoto's: "he
   (Takeda Shingen) was a strict disciplinarian as a warrior, and there is
   an exemplary story in the Hagakure relating his execution of two
   brawlers, not because they had fought, but because they had not fought
   to the death."^[275][21]^[276][22]

   The rival of [277]Takeda Shingen (1521-1573) was [278]Uesugi Kenshin
   (1530-1578), a legendary Sengoku warlord well-versed in the Chinese
   military classics and who advocated the "way of the warrior as death".
   Japanese historian Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki describes Uesugi's beliefs
   as: "Those who are reluctant to give up their lives and embrace death
   are not true warriors.... Go to the battlefield firmly confident of
   victory, and you will come home with no wounds whatever. Engage in
   combat fully determined to die and you will be alive; wish to survive
   in the battle and you will surely meet death. When you leave the house
   determined not to see it again you will come home safely; when you have
   any thought of returning you will not return. You may not be in the
   wrong to think that the world is always subject to change, but the
   warrior must not entertain this way of thinking, for his fate is always
   determined."^[279][23]

   Families such as the Imagawa were influential in the development of
   warrior ethics and were widely quoted by other lords during their
   lifetime. The writings of [280]Imagawa Sadayo were highly respected and
   sought out by Tokugawa Ieyasu as the source of [281]Japanese Feudal
   Law. These writings were a required study among traditional Japanese
   until World War II^[[282]citation needed].
   [283]Edo period screen depicting the [284]Battle of Sekigahara. It
   began on 21 October 1600 with a total of 160,000 men facing each other.

   Historian H. Paul Varley notes the description of Japan given by Jesuit
   leader [285]St. Francis Xavier (1506-1552): "There is no nation in the
   world which fears death less." Xavier further [286]describes the honor
   and manners of the people: "I fancy that there are no people in the
   world more punctilious about their honour than the Japanese, for they
   will not put up with a single insult or even a word spoken in anger."
   Xavier spent the years 1549-1551 converting Japanese to Christianity.
   He also observed: "The Japanese are much braver and more warlike than
   the people of China, Korea, [287]Ternate and all of the other nations
   around the Philippines."^[288][24]

Arts

   In December 1547, Francis was in Malacca (Malaysia) waiting to return
   to Goa (India) when he met a low-ranked samurai named Anjiro (possibly
   spelled "Yajiro"). Anjiro was not a nobleman or an intellectual, but he
   impressed Xavier because he took careful notes of everything he said in
   church. Xavier made the decision to go to Japan in part because this
   low-ranking samurai convinced him in Portuguese that the Japanese
   people were highly educated and eager to learn. They were hard workers
   and respectful of authority. In their laws and customs they were led by
   reason, and, should the Christian faith convince them of its truth,
   they would accept it en masse.^[289][25]

   [290]Ulsan during the [291]Japanese invasions of Korea, 1597

   By the 12th century, upper-class samurai were highly literate due to
   the general introduction of Confucianism from China during the 7th to
   9th centuries, and in response to their perceived need to deal with the
   imperial court, who had a monopoly on culture and literacy for most of
   the Heian period. As a result they aspired to the more cultured
   abilities of the nobility.^[292][26]

   Examples such as Taira Tadanori (a samurai who appears in the
   [293]Heike Monogatari) demonstrate that warriors idealized the arts and
   aspired to become skilled in them.

   Tadanori was famous for his skill with the pen and the sword or the
   "bun and the bu", the harmony of fighting and learning. Samurai were
   expected to be cultured and literate, and admired the ancient saying
   "bunbu-ryodo" (¦¡, lit., literary arts, military arts, both ways) or
   "The pen and the sword in accord." By the time of the Edo period, Japan
   had a higher literacy comparable to that in central Europe.^[294][27]

   The number of men who actually achieved the ideal and lived their lives
   by it was high. An early term for warrior, "uruwashii", was written
   with a kanji that combined the characters for literary study ("bun" )
   and military arts ("bu" ¦), and is mentioned in the Heike Monogatari
   (late 12th century). The Heike Monogatari makes reference to the
   educated poet-swordsman ideal in its mention of Taira no Tadanori's
   death:^[295][28]

   Friends and foes alike wet their sleeves with tears and said,

   What a pity! Tadanori was a great general,
   pre-eminent in the arts of both sword and poetry.

   In his book "Ideals of the Samurai" translator [296]William Scott
   Wilson states: "The warriors in the [297]Heike Monogatari served as
   models for the educated warriors of later generations, and the ideals
   depicted by them were not assumed to be beyond reach. Rather, these
   ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society
   and recommended as the proper form of the Japanese man of arms. With
   the Heike Monogatari, the image of the Japanese warrior in literature
   came to its full maturity."^[298][28] Wilson then translates the
   writings of several warriors who mention the Heike Monogatari as an
   example for their men to follow.

   Plenty of warrior writings document this ideal from the 13th century
   onward. Most warriors aspired to or followed this ideal otherwise there
   would have been no cohesion in the samurai armies.^[299][29]

Culture

   As de facto aristocrats for centuries, samurai developed their own
   cultures that influenced Japanese culture as a whole. The culture
   associated with the samurai such as the [300]tea ceremony, monochrome
   ink painting, rock gardens and poetry were adopted by warrior patrons
   throughout the centuries 1200-1600. These practices were adapted from
   the Chinese arts. Zen monks introduced them to Japan and they were
   allowed to flourish due to the interest of powerful warrior elites.
   [301]Muso Soseki (1275-1351) was a Zen monk who was advisor to both
   Emperor Go-Daigo and General Ashikaga Takauji (1304-58). Muso, as well
   as other monks, acted as political and cultural diplomat between Japan
   and China. Muso was particularly well known for his garden design.
   Another Ashikaga patron of the arts was Yoshimasa. His cultural
   advisor, the Zen monk Zeami, introduced tea ceremony to him.
   Previously, tea had been used primarily for Buddhist monks to stay
   awake during meditation.^[302][30]

   A 10-volume set of books with wood block prints by Osaka artist
   Matsukawa Hanzan (1820-1882?) dated 1863

   In general, samurai, aristocrats, and priests had a very high literacy
   rate in [307]kanji. Recent studies have shown that literacy in kanji
   among other groups in society was somewhat higher than previously
   understood. For example, court documents, birth and death records and
   marriage records from the Kamakura period, submitted by farmers, were
   prepared in Kanji. Both the kanji literacy rate and skills in math
   improved toward the end of Kamakura period.^[308][26]

   Literacy was generally high among the warriors and the common classes
   as well. The feudal lord [309]Asakura Norikage (1474-1555 AD) noted the
   great loyalty given to his father, due to his polite letters, not just
   to fellow samurai, but also to the farmers and townspeople:

     There were to Lord Eirin's character many high points difficult to
     measure, but according to the elders the foremost of these was the
     way he governed the province by his civility. It goes without saying
     that he acted this way toward those in the samurai class, but he was
     also polite in writing letters to the farmers and townspeople, and
     even in addressing these letters he was gracious beyond normal
     practice. In this way, all were willing to sacrifice their lives for
     him and become his allies.^[310][31]

   In a letter dated 29 January 1552, [311]St Francis Xavier observed the
   ease of which the Japanese understood prayers due to the high level of
   literacy in Japan at that time:

     There are two kinds of writing in Japan, one used by men and the
     other by women; and for the most part both men and women, especially
     of the nobility and the commercial class, have a literary education.
     The bonzes, or bonzesses, in their monasteries teach letters to the
     girls and boys, though rich and noble persons entrust the education
     of their children to private tutors.
     Most of them can read, and this is a great help to them for the easy
     understanding of our usual prayers and the chief points of our holy
     religion.^[312][32]

   In a letter to [313]Father Ignatius Loyola at [314]Rome, Xavier further
   noted the education of the upper classes:

     The Nobles send their sons to monasteries to be educated as soon as
     they are 8 years old, and they remain there until they are 19 or 20,
     learning reading, writing and religion; as soon as they come out,
     they marry and apply themselves to politics. They are discreet,
     magnanimous and lovers of virtue and letters, honouring learned men
     very much.

   In a letter dated 11 November 1549, Xavier described a multi-tiered
   educational system in Japan consisting of "universities", "colleges",
   "academies" and hundreds of monasteries that served as a principle
   center for learning by the populace:

     But now we must give you an account of our stay at Cagoxima. We put
     into that port because the wind was adverse to our sailing to Meaco,
     which is the largest city in Japan, and most famous as the residence
     of the King and the Princes. It is said that after four months are
     passed the favourable season for a voyage to Meaco will return, and
     then with the good help of God we shall sail thither. The distance
     from Cagoxima is three hundred leagues. We hear wonderful stories
     about the size of Meaco : they say that it consists of more than
     ninety thousand dwellings. There is a very famous University there,
     as well as five chief colleges of students, and more than two
     hundred monasteries of bonzes, and of others who are like
     coenobites, called Legioxi, as well as of women of the same kind,
     who are called Hamacutis. Besides this of Meaco, there are in Japan
     five other principal academies, at Coya, at Negu, at Fisso, and at
     Homia. These are situated round Meaco, with short distances between
     them, and each is frequented by about three thousand five hundred
     scholars. Besides these there is the Academy at Bandou, much the
     largest and most famous in all Japan, and at a great distance from
     Meaco. Bandou is a large territory, ruled by six minor princes, one
     of whom is more powerful than the others and is obeyed by them,
     being himself subject to the King of Japan, who is called the Great
     King of Meaco. The things that are given out as to the greatness and
     celebrity of these universities and cities are so wonderful as to
     make us think of seeing them first with our own eyes and
     ascertaining the truth, and then when we have discovered and know
     how things really are, of writing an account of them to you.
     10^[[315]clarification needed] They say that there are several
     lesser academies besides those which we have mentioned.

Names

   A samurai was usually named by combining one [316]kanji from his father
   or grandfather and one new kanji. Samurai normally used only a small
   part of their total name.

   For example, the full name of [317]Oda Nobunaga would be "Oda
   Kazusanosuke Saburo Nobunaga" (°¡·), in which "Oda" is a clan or family
   name, "Kazusanosuke" is a title of vice-governor of Kazusa province,
   "Saburo" is a name before [318]genpuku, a coming of age ceremony, and
   "Nobunaga" is an adult name. Samurai were able to choose their own
   first names.

Marriage

   The [319]marriage of samurai was done by having a marriage arranged by
   someone with the same or higher rank than those being married. While
   for those samurai in the upper ranks this was a necessity (as most had
   few opportunities to meet a female), this was a [320]formality for
   lower ranked samurai. Most samurai married women from a samurai family,
   but for a lower ranked samurai, marriages with commoners were
   permitted. In these marriages a [321]dowry was brought by the woman and
   was used to start their new lives.

   A samurai could have a [322]mistress but her background was strictly
   checked by higher ranked samurai. In many cases, this was treated like
   a marriage. "Kidnapping" a mistress, although common in fiction, would
   have been shameful, if not a crime. When she was a commoner, a
   messenger would be sent with betrothal money or a note for exemption of
   tax to ask for her parent's acceptance and many parents gladly
   accepted. If a samurai's wife gave birth to a son he could then one day
   become a samurai.

   A samurai could [323]divorce his wife for a variety of reasons with
   approval from a superior, but divorce was, while not entirely
   nonexistent, a rare event. A reason for divorce would be if she could
   not produce a son, but then [324]adoption could be arranged as an
   alternative to divorce. A samurai could divorce for personal reasons,
   even if he simply did not like his wife, but this was generally avoided
   as it would embarrass the samurai who had arranged the marriage. A
   woman could also arrange a divorce, although it would generally take
   the form of the samurai divorcing her. After a divorce samurai had to
   return the betrothal money, which often prevented divorces. Some rich
   merchants had their daughters marry samurai to erase a samurai's debt
   and advance their positions.

Women

   Main article: [325]Onna bugeisha
   Japanese woman preparing for [326]jigai (female version of seppuku) to
   follow her husband in death.

   Maintaining the household was the main duty of samurai women. This was
   especially crucial during early feudal Japan, when warrior husbands
   were often traveling abroad or engaged in clan battles. The wife, or
   okugatasama (meaning: one who remains in the home), was left to manage
   all household affairs, care for the children, and perhaps even defend
   the home forcibly. For this reason, many women of the samurai class
   were trained in wielding a polearm called a [327]naginata or a special
   knife called the [328]kaiken in an art called [329]tantojutsu (lit. the
   skill of the knife), which they could use to protect their household,
   family, and honor if the need arose.

   Traits valued in women of the samurai class were humility, obedience,
   self-control, strength, and loyalty. Ideally, a samurai wife would be
   skilled at managing property, keeping records, dealing with financial
   matters, educating the children (and perhaps servants, too), and caring
   for elderly parents or in-laws that may be living under her roof.
   Confucian law, which helped define personal relationships and the code
   of ethics of the warrior class required that a woman show subservience
   to her husband, filial piety to her parents, and care to the children.
   Too much love and affection was also said to indulge and spoil the
   youngsters. Thus, a woman was also to exercise discipline.

   Though women of wealthier samurai families enjoyed perks of their
   elevated position in society, such as avoiding the physical labor that
   those of lower classes often engaged in, they were still viewed as far
   beneath men. Women were prohibited from engaging in any political
   affairs and were usually not the heads of their household.

   This does not mean that samurai women were always powerless. Powerful
   women both wisely and unwisely wielded power at various occasions.
   After [330]Ashikaga Yoshimasa, 8th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate
   lost interest in politics, his wife [331]Hino Tomiko largely ruled in
   his place. Nene, wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was known to overrule her
   husband's decisions at times and Yodo, his mistress, became the de
   facto master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's
   death. [332]Tachibana Ginchiyo was chosen to lead the Tachibana clan
   after her father's death. Chiyo, wife of Yamauchi Kazutoyo, has long
   been considered the ideal samurai wife. According to legend, she made
   her kimono out of a quilted patchwork of bits of old cloth and saved
   pennies to buy her husband a magnificent horse, on which he rode to
   many victories. The fact that Chiyo (though she is better known as
   "Wife of Yamauchi Kazutoyo") is held to such high esteem for her
   economic sense is illuminating in the light of the fact that she never
   produced an heir and the Yamauchi clan was succeeded by Kazutoyo's
   younger brother. The source of power for women may have been that
   samurai looked down upon matters concerning money and left their
   finances to their wives.

   As the Tokugawa period progressed more value became placed on
   education, and the education of females beginning at a young age became
   important to families and society as a whole. Marriage criteria began
   to weigh intelligence and education as desirable attributes in a wife,
   right along with physical attractiveness. Though many of the texts
   written for women during the Tokugawa period only pertained to how a
   woman could become a successful wife and household manager, there were
   those that undertook the challenge of learning to read, and also
   tackled philosophical and literary classics. Nearly all women of the
   samurai class were literate by the end of the Tokugawa period.

Western samurai

   The [333]French Navy officer [334]Eugène Collache fought for the Shogun
   as a samurai during the [335]Boshin War (1869).

   The English sailor and adventurer [336]William Adams (1564-1620) seems
   to have been the first Westerner to receive the dignity of samurai. The
   Shogun [337]Tokugawa Ieyasu presented him with two swords representing
   the authority of a samurai, and decreed that William Adams the sailor
   was dead and that Anjin Miura (¦), a samurai, was born. Adams also
   received the title of [338]hatamoto (bannerman), a high-prestige
   position as a direct retainer in the Shogun's court. He was provided
   with generous revenues: "For the services that I have done and do
   daily, being employed in the Emperor's service, the emperor has given
   me a living" (Letters). He was granted a fief in Hemi (¸) within the
   boundaries of present-day [339]Yokosuka City, "with eighty or ninety
   husbandmen, that be my slaves or servants" (Letters). His estate was
   valued at 250 [340]koku. He finally wrote "God hath provided for me
   after my great misery," (Letters) by which he meant the disaster-ridden
   voyage that initially brought him to Japan.

   [341]Jan Joosten van Lodensteijn (1556?-1623?), a Dutch colleague of
   Adams' on their ill-fated voyage to Japan in the ship De Liefde, was
   also given similar privileges by Tokugawa Ieyasu. It appears Joosten
   became a samurai^[[342]citation needed] and was given a residence
   within Ieyasu's castle at Edo. Today, this area at the east exit of
   [343]Tokyo Station is known as [344]Yaesu («²). Yaesu is a corruption
   of the Dutchman's Japanese name, Yayousu (¶). Also in common with
   Adam's, Joostens was given a [345]Red Seal Ship (±°¹) allowing him to
   trade between Japan and [346]Indo-China. On a return journey from
   [347]Batavia Joosten drowned after his ship ran aground.

   Also, during the [348]Boshin War (1868-1869), French soldiers joined
   the forces of the Shogun against the Southern Daimyos favorable to the
   restoration of the [349]Meiji emperor. It is recorded that the French
   Navy officer [350]Eugène Collache fought in samurai attire with his
   Japanese brothers-in-arms. At the same time, the Prussian [351]Edward
   Schnell served the [352]Aizu domain as a military instructor and
   procurer of weapons. He was granted the Japanese name Hiramatsu Buhei
   (³¾¦µ), which inverted the characters of the daimyo's name
   [353]Matsudaira. Hiramatsu (Schnell) was given the right to wear
   swords, as well as a residence in the castle town of [354]Wakamatsu, a
   Japanese wife, and retainers. In many contemporary references, he is
   portrayed wearing a Japanese kimono, overcoat, and swords, with Western
   riding trousers and boots.

     * [361]Japanese swords are the weapons that have come to be
       synonymous with the samurai. Ancient Japanese swords from the
       [362]Nara period ([363]Chokuto) featured a straight blade, by the
       late 900s curved [364]tachi appeared, followed by the
       [365]uchigatana and ultimately the [366]katana. Smaller commonly
       known companion swords are the [367]wakizashi and the
       [368]tanto.^[369][33] Wearing a long sword ([370]katana) or
       ([371]tachi) together with a smaller sword such as a wakizashi or
       tanto became the symbol of the samurai, this combination of swords
       is referred to as a [372]daisho (literally "big and small"). During
       the Edo period only samurai were allowed to wear a daisho.

     * [373]The yumi (longbow), reflected in the art of [374]kyujutsu
       (lit. the skill of the bow) was a major weapon of the Japanese
       military. Its usage declined with the introduction of the
       tanegashima (Japanese matchlock) during the [375]Sengoku period,
       but the skill was still practiced at least for sport.^[376][34] The
       yumi, an asymmetric [377]composite bow made from [378]bamboo,
       [379]wood, [380]rattan and [381]leather, had an effective range of
       50 meters (about 164 feet) or 100 meters (328 feet) if accuracy was
       not an issue. On foot, it was usually used behind a [382]tate (¾),
       a large, mobile wooden shield, but the yumi could also be used from
       horseback because of its asymmetric shape. The practice of shooting
       from horseback became a Shinto ceremony known as [383]yabusame
       (¬).^[384][35]

     * [385]Pole weapons including the [386]yari and [387]naginata were
       commonly used by the samurai. The [388]yari (Japanese spear)
       displaced the [389]naginata from the battlefield as personal
       bravery became less of a factor and battles became more organized
       around massed, inexpensive foot troops
       ([390]ashigaru).^[[391]citation needed] A charge, mounted or
       dismounted, was also more effective when using a spear rather than
       a sword, as it offered better than even odds against a samurai
       using a sword. In the Battle of Shizugatake where [392]Shibata
       Katsuie was defeated by [393]Toyotomi Hideyoshi, then known as
       Hashiba Hideyoshi, seven samurai who came to be known as the
       "[394]Seven Spears of Shizugatake" (¤KE³¬) played a crucial role in
       the victory.^[395][36]

   Various Japanese (samurai) Tanegashima matchlock firearms.
     * [396]Tanegashima (Japanese matchlock) were introduced to Japan in
       the 1543 through [397]Portuguese trade. Tanegashima were produced
       on a large scale by Japanese gunsmiths, enabling warlords to raise
       and train armies from masses of peasants. The new weapons were
       highly effective, their ease of use and deadly effectiveness led to
       the tanegashima becoming the weapon of choice over the yumi (bow).
       By the end of the 16th century, there were more firearms in Japan
       than in many European nations. Tanegashima--employed en masse,
       largely by [398]ashigaru peasant foot troops--were responsible for
       a change in military tactics that eventually led to establishment
       of the Tokugawa shogunate ([399]Edo period) and an end to civil
       war. Production of tanegashima declined sharply as there was no
       need for massive amounts of firearms. During the Edo period,
       tanegashima were stored away, and used mainly for hunting and
       target practice. Foreign intervention in the 1800s renewed interest
       in firearms--but the tanegashima was outdated by then, and various
       samurai factions purchased more modern firearms from European
       sources.

   The ozutsu (§), a swivel breech-loading cannon, 16th century
     * [400]Cannons became a common part of the samurai's armory in the
       1570s. They often were mounted in castles or on ships, being used
       more as anti-personnel weapons than against castle walls or the
       like, though in the [401]siege of Nagashino castle (1575) a cannon
       was used to good effect against an enemy siegetower. The first
       popular cannon in Japan were swivel-breech loaders nicknamed
       kunikuzushi or "province destroyers". Kunikuzushi weighed 264 lb
       (120 kg). and used 40 lb (18 kg). chambers, firing a small shot of
       10 oz (280 g). The [402]Arima clan of Kyushu used guns like this at
       the Battle of Okinawate against the [403]Ryuzoji clan. By the time
       of the [404]Osaka campaign (1614-1615), cannon technology had
       improved in Japan to the point where at Osaka, [405]Ii Naotaka
       managed to fire an 18 lb (8.2 kg). shot into the castle's
       keep.^[[406]citation needed]

     * [407]Staff weapons of many shapes and sizes made from oak and other
       hard woods were also used by the samurai, commonly known ones
       include the [408]bo, the [409]jo, the [410]hanbo, and the
       [411]tanbo.

     * [412]Clubs and truncheons made of iron and/or wood, of all shapes
       and sizes were used by the samurai. Some like the [413]jutte were
       one-handed weapons and others like the [414]kanabo were large
       two-handed weapons.

     * [415]Chain weapons, various weapons using chains kusari were used
       during the samurai era, the [416]kusarigama and [417]Kusari-fundo
       are examples.

Armour

   Main article: [418]Japanese armour
   [419]Edo period (1600s) samurai armor, Tosei-gusoku.

   As far back as the seventh century Japanese warriors wore a form of
   [420]lamellar armor, this armor eventually evolved into the armor worn
   by the samurai.^[421][37] The first types of Japanese armors identified
   as [422]samurai armor were known as yoroi. These early samurai armors
   were made from small individual scales known as kozane. The kozane were
   made from either iron or leather and were bound together into small
   strips, the strips were coated with lacquer to protect the kozane from
   water. A series of strips of kozane were then laced together with silk
   or leather lace and formed into a complete chest armor [423](dou or
   do).^[424][37]

   In the 1500s a new type of armor started to become popular due to the
   advent of firearms, new fighting tactics and the need for additional
   protection. The kozane dou made from individual scales was replaced by
   [425]plate armor. This new armor, which used iron plated [426]dou (do),
   was referred to as Tosei-gusoku, or modern armor.^[427][38]^[428][39]
   Various other components of armor protected the samurai's body. The
   helmet [429]kabuto was an important part of the samurai's armor.
   Samurai armor changed and developed as the methods of samurai warfare
   changed over the centuries.^[430][40] The known last use of samurai
   armor occurring in 1877 during the [431]satsuma rebellion.^[432][41] As
   the last samurai rebellion was crushed, Japan modernized its defenses
   and turned to a national conscription army that used
   uniforms.^[433][42]

   [438]Kanji for Samurai

   The term samurai originally meant "those who serve in close attendance
   to nobility", and was written with a [439]Chinese character (or
   [440]kanji) that had the same meaning. In Japanese, it was originally
   recorded in the Nara Period as a verb *samorapu ("to watch, to keep
   watch, to observe, to be on the lookout for something; to serve, to
   attend"), which is believed to be derived from the frequentative form
   (*morapu rahu) of the verb moru (ru, "to watch, to guard, to be on the
   lookout; to keep, to protect, to take care of, to be in charge of, to
   have as one's ward"). By the [441]Heian period, this word had developed
   into the verb saburahu (saburahu, "to serve, to attend"), from which a
   deverbal noun saburahi (saburahi, "servant, attendant") was later
   derived, and this noun then yielded samurahi (samurahi) in the Edo
   period. In Japanese literature, there is an early reference to samurai
   in the [442]Kokinshu (¤, early 10th century):^[443][43]

   Attendant to your nobility

   Ask for your master's umbrella
   The dews 'neath the trees of Miyagino
   Are thicker than rain

   The word bushi (¦«, lit. "warrior or armsman") first appears in an
   early history of Japan called [444]Shoku Nihongi (¥¬, AD 797). In a
   portion of the book covering the year AD 721, Shoku Nihongi states:
   "Literary men and Warriors are they whom the nation values". The term
   bushi is of [445]Chinese origin and adds to the indigenous Japanese
   words for warrior: tsuwamono and mononofu.

   Bushi was the name given to the ancient Japanese soldiers from
   traditional warrior families. The bushi class was developed mainly in
   the north of Japan. They formed powerful clans, which in the 12th
   century were against the noble families who were grouping themselves to
   support the imperial family who lived in Kyoto. Samurai was a word used
   by the [446]Kuge aristocratic class with warriors themselves preferring
   the word bushi. The term [447]Bushido, the "way of the warrior," is
   derived from this term and the mansion of a warrior was called
   bukeyashiki.

   The terms bushi and samurai became synonymous near the end of the 12th
   century, according to [448]William Scott Wilson in his book Ideals of
   the Samurai--Writings of Japanese Warriors. Wilson's book explores the
   origins of the word warrior in Japanese history as well as the kanji
   used to represent the word.

   "Breaking down the character bu (¦) reveals the radical (¢), meaning
   "to stop," and an abbreviation of the radical ( ) "spear." The Shuo
   Wen, an early Chinese dictionary, gives this definition: "Bu consists
   of subduing the weapon and therefore stopping the spear." The Tso
   Chuan, another early Chinese source, goes further:

     Bu consists of bun (), literature or letters (and generally the arts
     of peace), stopping the spear. Bu prohibits violence and subdues
     weapons ... it puts the people at peace, and harmonizes the masses.

   The radical shi («) on the other hand seems to have originally meant a
   person who performs some function or who has the ability in some field.
   Early in Chinese history it came to define the upper class of society,
   and in the Book of Han this definition is given :

     The shi, the farmer, the craftsman, and the tradesman are the four
     professions of the people. He who occupies his rank by means of
     learning is called a shi.

   Wilson states that the shi, as the highest of the four classes,
   brandished the weapons as well as the books. bushi therefore translates
   as "a man who has the ability to keep the peace, either by literary or
   military means, but predominantly by the latter".^[449][44]

   It was not until the early modern period, namely the
   [450]Azuchi-Momoyama period and early [451]Edo period of the late 16th
   and early 17th centuries that the word saburai was replaced with
   samurai. However, the meaning had changed long before that.
   A Samurai [452]katana in [453]koshirae.

   During the era of the rule of the samurai, the term yumitori (,
   "bowman") was also used as an honorary title of an accomplished warrior
   even though swordsmanship had become more important. (Japanese archery
   ([454]kyujutsu) is still strongly associated with the war god
   [455]Hachiman.)

   A samurai with no attachment to a clan or [456]daimyo (§) was called a
   [457]ronin (ªº). In Japanese, the word ronin means "wave man", a person
   destined to wander aimlessly forever, like the waves in the sea. The
   word came to mean a samurai who was no longer in the service of a lord
   because his lord had died, because the samurai had been banished or
   simply because the samurai chose to become a ronin.

   The pay of samurai was measured in koku of rice (180 liters; enough to
   feed a man for one year). Samurai in the service of the [458]han are
   called hanshi.
   Samurai and retainers with various types of armor and weapons, 1860s.

   The following terms are related to samurai or the samurai tradition:
     * Uruwashii
       a cultured warrior symbolized by the kanji for "bun" (literary
       study) and "bu" (military study or arts)
     * Buke (¦¶)
       A martial house or a member of such a house
     * Mononofu (mononohu)
       An ancient term meaning a warrior. Originally referred to a section
       of government under the [459]Ritsuryo system composed of
       low-ranking civil servants who held posts as jailers, executioners,
       watchmen, gatekeepers, bodyguards, market supervisors, etc.
     * Musha (¦)
       A shortened form of bugeisha (¦¸), lit. martial artist.
     * Shi («)
       A word roughly meaning "gentleman," it is sometimes used for
       samurai, in particular in words such as bushi (¦«, meaning warrior
       or samurai).
     * Tsuwamono (µ)
       An old term for a soldier popularized by [460]Matsuo Basho in his
       famous [461]haiku. Literally means "vessel, tool, weapon" (cf.
       Japanese utsuwa ¨ and utsuwamono ¨©).

Myth and reality

   Most samurai were bound by a code of [462]honor and were expected to
   set an example for those below them. A notable part of their code is
   [463]seppuku (¹, seppuku^[464]?) or hara kiri, which allowed a
   disgraced samurai to regain his honor by passing into death, where
   samurai were still beholden to social rules. Whilst there are many
   romanticized characterizations of samurai behavior such as the writing
   of [465]Bushido (¦«, Bushido^[466]?) in 1905, studies of [467]Kobudo
   and traditional [468]Budo indicate that the samurai were as practical
   on the battlefield as were any other warrior.

   Despite the rampant romanticism of the 20th century, samurai could be
   disloyal and treacherous (e.g., [469]Akechi Mitsuhide), cowardly,
   brave, or overly loyal (e.g., [470]Kusunoki Masashige). Samurai were
   usually loyal to their immediate superiors, who in turn allied
   themselves with higher lords. These loyalties to the higher lords often
   shifted; for example, the high lords allied under [471]Toyotomi
   Hideyoshi (£) were served by loyal samurai, but the [472]feudal lords
   under them could shift their support to [473]Tokugawa, taking their
   samurai with them. There were, however, also notable instances where
   samurai would be disloyal to their lord or [474]daimyo, when loyalty to
   the emperor was seen to have supremacy.^[475][45]

Popular culture

   Actor [477]Kotaro Satomi on the set of [478]Mito Komon

   [479]Jidaigeki (lit. historical [480]drama) has always been a staple
   program on Japanese movies and TV. The programs typically feature a
   samurai. Samurai films and [481]westerns share a number of similarities
   and the two have influenced each other over the years. Kurosawa was
   inspired by the works of director [482]John Ford and in turn Kurosawa's
   works have been remade into westerns such as [483]The Seven Samurai
   into [484]The Magnificent Seven and [485]Yojimbo into [486]A Fistful of
   Dollars. There is also a 26 episode anime adaptation ([487]Samurai 7)
   of The Seven Samurai.

   [488]Eiji Yoshikawa is one of the most famous Japanese [489]historical
   novelists. His retellings of popular works, including [490]Taiko,
   [491]Musashi and [492]Heike Tale are popular among readers for their
   epic narratives and rich realism in depicting samurai and warrior
   culture.

   The samurai have also appeared frequently in Japanese comics
   ([493]manga) and animation ([494]anime). Most common are historical
   works where the protagonist is either a samurai or former samurai (or
   another rank/position) who possesses considerable martial skill.
   Samurai-like characters are not just restricted to historical settings
   and a number of works set in the modern age, and even the future,
   include characters who live, train and fight like samurai. Examples
   being [495]Samurai Champloo, [496]Requiem from the Darkness,
   [497]Muramasa: The Demon Blade, and [498]Afro Samurai.

   American [499]comic books have adopted the character type for stories
   of their own like [500]Silver Samurai of [501]Marvel Comics.

   A film released in 2003 titled [502]The Last Samurai, starring [503]Tom
   Cruise, is inspired by the Samurai way of life.

   The television series [504]Power Rangers Samurai (adapted from
   [505]Samurai Sentai Shinkenger) is also inspired by the way of the
   Samurai.
