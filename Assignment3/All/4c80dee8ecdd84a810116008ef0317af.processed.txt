[15]Pattern of Life and Temporal Signatures of Hacker Organizations

   by [16]holden under [17]Cyber Security

   Observing an organization or person by their [18]activities using web
   intelligence can provide interesting clues about who and where they
   actually are. These clues can include targets, methods, tools,
   language, etc. This is true in both the physical and cyber world.

   In this post we'll look at the temporal signature of activities by
   hacker groups and use those to discern their pattern of life -
   basically their work week - for matching with national work
   weeks/schedules.

   Top level conclusion?

   Different groups have different temporal signatures that could
   potentially be used to differentiate between those on very regular
   schedules - i.e. working a desk job (nation state?) - and those on
   nights/weekend schedules - independent hackers? - as well as to
   establish their geographic location.

   Temporal analysis has long played a part in cyber defense. For example,
   [19]Bob Gourley, who was the Director of Intelligence for a new (at the
   time) military unit responsible for defending all DoD networks,
   indicated in a conversation with me the [20]initial Moonlight Maze
   intrusion set matched up very well with working hours in Moscow.

   This was just one of many other factors that pointed to Russian
   involvement, but it helped orient analysts.

   Another example is how [21]Mandiant used observations of hacker team
   activity as one signal of indicating a group being Chinese (or in other
   other countries in same time zone):

     "Hacker teams [22]regularly began work, for the most part, at 8 a.m.
     Beijing time. Usually they continued for a standard work day, but
     sometimes the hacking persisted until midnight."

   KPMG calls out in their [23]Cyber threat intelligence and the lessons
   from law enforcement report:

     "Time: Are there any temporal patterns regarding cyber attacks and,
     similarly, are your information assets more vulnerable at certain
     times?"

Sample world wide work week patterns

   A quick [24]summary of work week data from Wikipedia yields us the
   following on work week from around the world:
   [25]Global Weekend Calendar

   Work Week Calendar

Analyzing hacker groups given work week as baseline

   Now given the above temporal signatures - can we say anything about
   various hacker groups? We'll find out using the Recorded Future data
   set, and in particular 250,000 cyber threat events involving various
   groups and individuals and times of attacks all collected from open web
   sources ranging from Twitter and other social media to government sites
   to hacker forums to regular news in seven different languages.

   We've taken all the time points of the events and transformed them to
   day of week so that we can determine what days various groups activate
   and other patterns.

   Below we look at a series of hacker groups - Syrian Electronic Army,
   Anonymous, Al Qassam Cyber Fighters, Lulzsec, Zcompany, and TeaMp0ison
   - versus a large group of other cyber events that either fall with
   other groups (Nation states, individuals, and other groups) as well as
   non-attributed attacks. Our data collection harvests open source data,
   so obviously, there is potential for skewing towards more media
   oriented groups (e.g. Anonymous, and yes, we have more data on them),
   but given that we're looking at the pattern, not the volume, this
   should be less of an issue.
   [26]Temporal Patterns of Cyber Attacks

   Temporal Patterns of Cyber Attacks

   The graph above visualizes weekday distribution for each group. A
   statistical test for non-random distribution is at the very bottom of
   the post.

Group-by-group observations

     * Syrian Electronic Army
          + Activates right after Syrian weekend. Between actual name and
            pattern of life/temporal signature this certainly indicates a
            group located in Syria that takes time off during the weekend,
            i.e. potentially a state sponsored group on a paid schedule.
     * Anonymous
          + Anonymous interestingly peaks in activity during the weekend,
            which indicates that they are mostly students or western
            people with "normal jobs" that use weekends for hacking. Good
            example would be how [27]Reuters recently fired an alleged
            Anonymous member, who probably had a busy regular workweek. We
            will be back to take apart the temporal signature by various
            Anonymous groups around the world.
     * Al Qassam Cyber Fighters
          + Al Qassam Cyber Fighters activates on Mondays and Wednesdays.
            Given their focus on hitting US and European banks this could
            make a lot of sense: hit them Monday morning when online
            banking activity peaks up. But you could also argue that the
            pattern indicates activating after Saturday, i.e. a regular
            state-employed hacker week in the middle East.
     * Lulzsec
          + Lulzsec (the breakout group from Anonymous) is interestingly
            enough completely inverted in its temporal signature from
            Anonymous. It peaks on Wednesday (and this is across many
            observations.) This might just be the peak of internet
            traffic...
     * ZCompany
          + Fits the "modern Islamic country" calendar perfectly: key
            activity is Monday-Thursday with little activity
            Friday-Sunday. The organized work schedule may indicate a
            state actor/paid schedule. It could also point to Pakistan,
            which aligns with ZCompany's [28]targeting of India.
     * TeaMp0ison
          + This rival group to Lulzsec activates Tuesday-Wednesday. It's
            targeting is inconsistent but includes anti-Islamic targets.

Cross correlation analysis

   There is great potential for cross correlation analysis here:
     * Compare activity with temporal signatures other than the work week
       such as Thanksgiving, Christmas break, Spring break, Ramadan, etc.
     * Compare group activity to their Twitter patterns through the use
       of [29]http://sleepingtime.org/. Potentially a very insightful
       cross-correlation to be had with this data, for example, TeaMp0ison
       - [30]http://sleepingtime.org/teamp0ison.
     * Correlate with other pattern of life variables: targeting, human
       language used, people association, etc.
     * Correlate/normalize vs. general internet activity per country
       potentially with [31]Internet Census data. Likewise, the data from
       [32]HoneyNet would be powerful to mash up and investigate.
     * If you had access to proprietary IP level data of attacks by these
       groups you could obviously cross-correlate those activities in a
       very powerful way. Unfortunately, such data is less readily
       available to the public.

Conclusion

   Temporal signatures can be helpful in developing pattern of life
   analysis on groups in cyberspace. Obviously it's only one signal, but
   potentially a quite interesting one.

   Appendix - comments on data and analysis
     * Data is from Recorded Future collection activities, explore
       interactively at [33]www.recordedfuture.com
     * Time stamp is event time, which should be time of event. However,
       given the nature of cyber attacks it could very well be time of
       discovery/publication.
     * There are multiple normalizations that could be done to this data -
       both within the domain of cyber events as well normalization vs. a
       total event metric - and we will be back with that.
     * As a statistical test we did a chi squared test on likelihood that
       day of week is unrelated a cyber attack. Results below - day of
       week is significant for all groups except for ZCompany.
