Virgin Atlantic Launches World's First-Ever Glass-Bottomed Plane

   by Moderator [46]Maxine April - last edited April

   Virgin Atlantic's glass-bottomed plane.jpg


   As you may have seen in the [47]national press, after nearly 30 years
   of providing the ultimate long-haul flying experience, Virgin Atlantic
   and our founder Richard Branson are once again flying in the face of
   ordinary by announcing the creation of a world first in aircraft
   innovation. This technological innovation coincides with the start of
   our first ever domestic service, Little Red.


   Today we've announced that our world-class engineering crew have been
   secretly working on the design and production of the world's first-ever
   glass-bottomed plane, created to ensure passengers can enjoy both an
   unparalleled flying experience, as well as a selection of stunning
   landscapes from the comfort of their seats.


   The new aircraft will offer every passenger the chance of a bird's eye
   view with an extra special opportunity to look down on the beautiful
   scenery of Great Britain as they fly.


   The project has been personally funded by Richard Branson and overseen
   by Virgin Atlantic's own Innovation team, who have been hard at work on
   this top secret project for several years. Richard set himself a
   personal goal to change the face of flying forever when he started
   Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984 and this is one of many in the long
   line of aviation breakthroughs.

   The service will be open for bookings shortly and if it proves popular
   there are plans to explore options for adding a glass-bottomed plane on
   routes to long-haul travel destinations too.


   The aircraft will look identical to the standard Airbus A320 that is
   currently being used on Little Red's domestic routes, but will have a
   clear strip made from aviation-standard glass in place of the
   traditional aisle. This ensures the aisle in the plane's underbelly is
   completely see through, allowing passengers to look down directly as
   the plane makes its journey through the sky.


   Cabin crew will also be specially trained to assist with any fliers who
   may be nervous travelling on the innovative aircraft. As an
   alternative, those anxious fliers are urged to book onto the two other
   daily flights from Heathrow to Aberdeen running as part of Little Red's
   scheduled timetable.


   "I'm thrilled to announce that Virgin has created another world-first
   with the introduction of the technology required to produce the world's
   first glass-bottomed plane," said Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic
   founder and president. "In 1984 we started the wonderful airline that
   is Virgin Atlantic Airways. I am incredibly proud of yet another
   aviation breakthrough which has been years in the making. I can't wait
   to experience the first flight for myself with my family and other
   natural born explorers."


   "I have asked the rest of the Virgin companies to get on board and
   support my latest quest to help us support the new domestic Scottish
   flight path. This really is a team effort from all corners of Virgin.

   "2012 was a year of celebrating what is brilliant about Great Britain
   and I'm excited that in 2013 we are continuing this uplifting spirit by
   developing an experience that will enable Little Red passengers to
   appreciate the beauty of the British landscape. And with an unrivalled
   view of Scotland I hope this gives Scottish tourism an even bigger
   boost.


   To see the entire Virgin group activity to support the glass-bottomed
   plane and further information on this exciting announcement, please

   [49]Virgin Atlantic Little Red is our new UK domestic service, offering
   great value, full service multiple daily flights between London and
   Manchester, London and Aberdeen and London and Edinburgh. Little Red
   flights can be [50]booked now, bringing you closer to all our
   destinations.

   The great thing about this, my daughter will never fight for window
   seats again. She was very amused and breath taken when she saw this.
   Looks magnificent, scary and glamourous but I think I will get
   headaches too. WOWCHA!
