   Going Private: BMC Blazes Private Trail That Dell Will Follow
   In my blog post for ITBusinessEdge I look at BMC who just turned the
   corner and became private this week and used it as an example of what
   is ahead for Dell. BMC will lead Dell through this process and
   showcases some of the initial concerns about a process that often cuts
   too deeply and leaves customers exposed. Neither company is likely to
   make that mistake having handpicked the investors; and both firms
   expect to eventually re-emerge as very different companies when they go
   public again. Full column on ITBusinessEdge:
