Sebastian Thrun: Update on our SJSU Plus Summer Pilot

   We have some exciting news to share on our SJSU Plus Pilot. To remind
   everyone, with the encouragement of California Governor Brown, Udacity
   teamed up with SJSU to deliver for-credit college classes online. A key
   objective for this partnership has been to bring college education to
   students who are presently under-served and left out of higher
   education.
   This summer, we ran the second instance of our pilot. While in the
   Spring, we actively sought out underserved high schools from low-income
   areas in California, this time we simply opened up enrollment to
   anyone. As predicted, with 2,091 students who enrolled, we mainly
   reached students who would not ordinarily attend college. Only 11% of
   the summer students who took the for-credit courses from SJSU were
   matriculated students in one of the California State Universities. 71%
   of our students came from out of state or foreign countries. And while
   the total number of high school students went up, their proportion in
   the total student body went down.
   Hot off the press, here are the latest results for the summer pilot.
   For comparison, we also provide rates of students who received a C or
   better for the Spring and Summer pilots, and the comparable rates for
   on-campus classes at SJSU averaged over the past six semesters.

   In short, pass rates are up and match more closely those in SJSU
   on-campus classes.
   We did change a number of things. A good fraction of the content was
   re-done between spring and summer. We used data from the spring to
   understand what parts of our content worked, and what needed to be
   improved. We added hints for challenging exercises, and we added more
   course support staff to assist with online discussions and
   communications. We also changed the pacing methodology, informing
   students earlier and as part of their course experience when they were
   falling behind. And reaping the benefits of all the hard work in the
   spring when they were busy preparing all the content, SJSU's professors
   spent much more time over the summer interacting with students.
   Undoubtedly, these changes had an impact on the student experience and
   success rate.
   Another way to achieve high pass rates is to be highly selective in the
   student admissions process. Elite private institutions are masters at
   picking the very best students, and consequently their graduation rates
   are amazing. We wanted this program to be the opposite.
   One key difference between Spring and Summer was that we opened our
   Summer session to everyone. This led to a substantial difference in
   student body. Among the student body, 53% reported that they already
   hold a post-secondary degree (5% Associate, 28% Bachelor's, 16%
   Master's, and 4% Doctorate). Only 12% of the students had a high school
   graduate diploma or equivalent, and 15% were active high school
   students. This is very different from the Spring Pilot, in which
   approximately 50% of the student body were active high school students,
   and the other 50% were matriculated SJSU students.
   And interestingly, college credit was not the leading motivation for
   students to take these courses for credit. With love of learning,
   career advancement, and lack of options all part of the equation, we
   found we were serving a broader need:
   [hMe-XPK2FILCqINQ9VfxOnJOwEIoYz0Fc3uQnl2WHXC8LfScKXR4y-TMdoyxr1glWPm8wx
   T_oOW1-04zUGAi00EcXSqbwUAoTEskPBqiHruzmXGR2lC_wBUHeA]
   Yet with these new results, we still aren't there. There remains so
   much more that needs to be improved. The summer pilot was the second
   iteration of a new approach. To all those people who declared our
   experiment a failure, you have to understand how innovation works. Few
   ideas work on the first try. Iteration is key to innovation. We are
   seeing significant improvement in learning outcomes and student
   engagement. And we know from our data that there is much more to be
   done.
   We know that students learn at different speeds. This is particularly
   the case in the mathematical sciences, where it just takes a while to
   really understand certain concepts. Rushing students through a timed
   curriculum with a pre-defined pace cannot be the best way to achieve
   lasting success. In our remedial math class, we only gave students a
   single chance to pass various exams. If they even failed the first
   midterm, they failed the class. On campus, multiple chances are
   offered. There are clear opportunities to rethink assessment as a
   whole, especially as we open up new pacing options.
   It is important to acknowledge that we are entering uncharted
   territory. I have been fortunate to work with some of the very best
   innovators in the world. I have learned that innovation requires a
   clear vision, many iterations, and a willingness to learn and improve.
   I believe we are on a path where we can break down many of the barriers
   to access in higher education. But this is just the beginning of this
   path. I am excited to see where the next round will take us.
