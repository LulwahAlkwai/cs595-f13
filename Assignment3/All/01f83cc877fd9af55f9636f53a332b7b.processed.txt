Want a Great Scientific Career? Choose Computer Science

   By
   [75]Jim Austin
   March 25, 2013

   "All other S&T fields pale by comparison." --PCAST

   During a recent conversation with computer scientist Ed Lazowska of the
   University of Washington, Seattle, he alerted Science Careers to a very
   impressive analysis from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) looking
   into trends for science-related jobs and predictions for job growth
   between the present and 2020.

   These are only projections, and job-market projections are generally
   not to be trusted. Yet, these come from an authoritative source, and
   the trends are hardly subtle. Here's an image Lazowska put together
   from the BLS projections, reproduced here with permission:

   That's right: According to BLS, 62% of the growth in jobs in
   science-related fields will be in computer science. That's more than
   750,000 new jobs, and a total of more than 1,350,000 job openings. How
   does that compare with the number of degrees likely to be granted by
   U.S. institutions? In 2009, those institutions granted something like
   95,000 computer science degrees, including about 32,000 associate's
   degrees and fewer than 1600 Ph.D.s. Over 10 years, that adds up to more
   than the number of new jobs that BLS expects will be added, but
   significantly fewer than the number of job openings.

   It's when you compare these numbers to other fields that you realize
   how much better prospects are likely to be in computer science.
   Consider that in the physical sciences, for example, BLS predicts that
   fewer than 36,000 new jobs will be created--a 3% increase. Counting
   replacements, BLS predicts 121,900 openings in all fields of physical
   science, at all degree levels, before 2020. According to the National
   Science Foundation, about 27,000 people were granted degrees in the
   physical sciences in 2009, at all degree levels, including associate's
   degrees. Multiply that by 10 and compare. You'll quickly see that
   supply is predicted to surpass demand.

   What about the other fields? Engineering jobs are projected to grow by
   14%. The growth in jobs in all other categories ranges from 1% (math)
   to 5% (social science and life science). The BLS chart, Lazowska
   explains, is "misleading, in that it only looks at BLS categories 15,
   17, and 19--health sciences are not included. And it's all jobs, not
   just Ph.D. jobs."

   Lazowska notes that the President's Council of Advisors on Science and
   Technology (PCAST) examined similar data from 2 years earlier and
   produced a report, signed by John P. Holdren, assistant to the
   president for science and technology and Director of the Office of
   Science and Technology Policy; Eric Lander, president and founding
   director of the Broad Institute; Shirley Ann Jackson, president of the
   Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and Eric Schmidt, executive chair
   (and former CEO) at Google, that reached the following conclusions:

   "Finding:  All indicators--all historical data, and all
   projections--argue that [computer science] is the dominant factor in
   America's science and technology employment, and that the gap between
   the demand for [computer science] talent and the supply of that talent
   is and will remain large.

   ...

   While there will be inevitable variations in demand for every field,
   the long-term prospects for employment in [computer science]
   occupations in the United States are exceedingly strong. All other S&T
   fields pale by comparison."

   (Lazowska points out that PCAST uses "NIT," short for "networking and
   information technology," instead of "computer science"--hence the
   square brackets.)

   A major variable, of course, is immigration policy, because
   internationally, more than enough degrees are granted to fill the
   predicted openings in the United States.

   We'll be posting the conversation with Lazowska in the next few days.
   Stay tuned. ...
