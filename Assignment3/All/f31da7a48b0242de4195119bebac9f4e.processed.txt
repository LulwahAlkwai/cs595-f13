   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   The Smartwatch That Will Be Hard To Beat. The TrueSmart Watch.
   Kickstarter funded this Smartwatch is a Smartphone with a strap and
   pretty impressive in that it runs Android 4.2.2 and has most of the
   core Smartphone features. Targeted to sell at just under $400 it has a
   pretty impressive feature set though I really worry about the battery
   life. It does set a bar for what you can do with a watch and the design
   while now stunning isn't bad either. You can almost imagine that logo
   on the back is an Apple. Check out the Omate TrueSmart watch in Gizmo
   Beast:
