8 Things We'd Change About Twitter

   What's This?

   [48]Twitter, the [49]second most popular social site in the world,
   intends to go public on a near-approaching date. That means that if you
   plan to buy any shares, you'll have a negligible say in the direction
   the company takes in the future.

   We'd like to take this chance to put in our 140 characters. Okay, more
   like 600 words, in this case.

   Though an excellent resource for news, jokes and information, Twitter
   is imperfect. Below, we've listed eight areas the site could improve
   upon before and after its IPO.

   Do you agree with our list? What would you change about Twitter? Make
   your case in the comments below.

1. Get rid of conversation lines.

   Conversation lines, Twitter's late August update, have faced a hugely
   negative response from users and the press. Twitter likely added the
   feature as a navigation improvement for newcomers, but it feels like a
   fundamental shift in the network's purpose.

     Hate, hate, HAAAAAAAATE this new [51]@Twitter feature that drags old
     convos back to top of my TL. If I wanted to be on Facebook, I'd be
     there.

     -- Clara Jeffery (@ClaraJeffery) [52]September 13, 2013

     Congratulations, twitter; the new conversation lines bring old
     tweets to the top of the timeline, making you about as useful as
     Facebook.

     -- netmeg (@netmeg) [53]August 29, 2013

   We'd like to see Twitter put a lid on this experiment and return to the
   unobtrusive "View Conversation" button.

2. Scheduled tweets.

   While users can schedule tweets through third party services like
   [54]Tweetdeck and [55]Hootsuite, we don't see why Twitter doesn't allow
   for it on-site.

3. Show platforms again.

   Twitter no longer displays the platforms from which users posted their
   tweets. This feature was useful as a platform discovery tool -- seeing
   what tools popular accounts used to manage their social presences. We'd
   like to see it again.

4. Access drafts on desktop.

     hey [56]@twitter maybe your next update should be so that you can
     make drafts and quote tweets on the desktop

     -- please louis Tu (@louisnuggles) [57]September 12, 2013

   Drafts: because sometimes the world just isn't ready for your hilarious
   tweet -- yet. The ability to save drafts and access them later is one
   of the best features of Twitter's mobile app. For some reason, though,
   drafts are inaccessible on the desktop version. We'd like to see an
   on-site desktop drafts feature in the future.

5. Bring back Instagram-friendly Twitter cards.

   Remember when [58]Instagrams automatically displayed when you expanded
   a tweet? We miss that.

   While the cut-off purportedly had nothing to do with [59]Facebook's
   purchase of Instagram, Twitter was the only site on which photo
   displaying was disabled. We'd like the companies to make up, reinstate
   this feature and beautify our feeds as soon as possible.

6. Improve location-based searches.

   Twitter's search function has improved exponentially since the company
   acquired Summize in 2008. However, there is still room for more
   innovation. One possible path? Allow users to perform better
   location-based searches. If you're looking for local information,
   location-based searches would eliminate the need for lengthy, bizarre
   "event hashtags."

   Editor's note: While Twitter's advanced search feature allows for a
   basic location-based searches within 15 miles of a given location, it's
   not all that easy to use. We'd like to see more search customization,
   allowing users to narrow or expand the range of their search as they
   see fit.

7. Chronology over curation.

   Twitter search results, by default, filter by "top" posts. We're fine
   with curation as an option, but the huge benefit of Twitter is seeing
   information chronologically in real time. We want Twitter to make the
   chronological "all" filter the default choice.

8. Update "Trends."

     This is why Trends suck, Twitter hasn't created a sane registration
     system so all these bots swarm trends with their bullshit

     -- Sneakernets (@Sneakernets) [60]September 13, 2013

   Twitter's "Trends" tool may boast a ton of locations, but it is not at
   all user-friendly. The only way to view trending topics from different
   locations is to manually select them individually, each time, from a
   pop-up screen. We'd like a place for trends in settings, which allows
   you to select multiple, custom locations at once. That way, we don't
   have to continuously switch back and forth.
