   Can Kara Swisher Become the $50M Dollar Woman? All Things D IPO
   Interesting Reuters' story on how the WSJ may lose All things D to an
   IPO. Swisher and Mossberg have done an excellent job creating a
   Technology Coverage property that is roughly valued at around $50M
   according to Reuters. They apparently are looking at spinning out the
   unit if the WSJ doesn't adequately fund them and either move to another
   service or go public. They have a decent bench but, as we have seen
   with other properties that have been sold (C/Net and a number of AOL's
   properties) living under an new manager can be rather painful so here
   is hoping they go the IPO route and have the skill set to run a
   company. With everyone and their brother going private at the moment it
   might be far more fun, though clearly less lucrative, to just spin out
   and not get acquired or go public. Just saying.... Reuters story here:
