   Standard & Poor's took the unprecedented step of downgrading the U.S.
   government's "AAA" sovereign credit rating Friday in a move that could
   send shock waves through global. The following is a press release from
   Standard & Poor's:

   - We have lowered our long-term sovereign credit rating on the
   United States of America to `AA+' from `AAA' and affirmed the `A-1+'
   short-term rating.

   - We have also removed both the short- and long-term ratings
   from CreditWatch negative.

   - The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation
   plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls
   short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the
   government's medium-term debt dynamics.

   - More broadly, the downgrade reflects our view that the
   effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking
   and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal
   and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned when we
   assigned a negative outlook to the rating on April 18, 2011.

   - Since then, we have changed our view of the difficulties in
   bridging the gulf between the political parties over fiscal policy,
   which makes us pessimistic about the capacity of Congress and the
   Administration to be able to leverage their agreement this week into a
   broader fiscal consolidation plan that stabilizes the government's debt
   dynamics any time soon.

   - The outlook on the long-term rating is negative. We could lower
   the long-term rating to `AA' within the next two years if we see that
   less reduction in spending than agreed to, higher interest rates, or
   new fiscal pressures during the period result in a higher general
   government debt trajectory than we currently assume in our base case.

   TORONTO (Standard & Poor's) Aug. 5, 2011-Standard & Poor's Ratings
   Services said today that it lowered its long-term sovereign credit
   rating on the United States of America to `AA+' from `AAA'. Standard &
   Poor's also said that the outlook on the long-term rating is negative.
   At the same time, Standard & Poor's affirmed its `A-1+' short-term
   rating on the U.S. In addition, Standard & Poor's removed both ratings
   from CreditWatch, where they were placed on July 14, 2011, with
   negative implications.

   The transfer and convertibility (T&C) assessment of the
   U.S.-our assessment of the likelihood of official interference in the
   ability of U.S.-based public- and private-sector issuers to secure
   foreign exchange for debt service-remains `AAA'.

   We lowered our long-term rating on the U.S. because we believe that
   the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and
   the related fiscal policy debate indicate that further near-term
   progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on
   entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on raising revenues is less
   likely than we previously assumed and will remain a contentious and
   fitful process. We also believe that the fiscal consolidation plan that
   Congress and the Administration agreed to this week falls short of the
   amount that we believe is necessary to stabilize the general government
   debt burden by the middle of the decade.

   Our lowering of the rating was prompted by our view on the rising
   public debt burden and our perception of greater policymaking
   uncertainty, consistent with our criteria (see "Sovereign Government
   Rating Methodology and Assumptions," June 30, 2011, especially
   Paragraphs 36-41). Nevertheless, we view the U.S. federal government's
   other economic, external, and monetary credit attributes, which form
   the basis for the sovereign rating, as broadly unchanged.

   We have taken the ratings off CreditWatch because the Aug. 2 passage
   of the Budget Control Act Amendment of 2011 has removed any perceived
   immediate threat of payment default posed by delays to raising the
   government's debt ceiling. In addition, we believe that the act
   provides sufficient clarity to allow us to evaluate the likely course
   of U.S. fiscal policy for the next few years.

   The political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see
   as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less
   effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The
   statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political
   bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy. Despite this year's
   wide-ranging debate, in our view, the differences between political
   parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge, and, as
   we see it, the resulting agreement fell well short of the comprehensive
   fiscal consolidation program that some proponents had envisaged until
   quite recently. Republicans and Democrats have only been able to agree
   to relatively modest savings on discretionary spending while delegating
   to the Select Committee decisions on more comprehensive measures. It
   appears that for now, new revenues have dropped down on the menu of
   policy options. In addition, the plan envisions only minor policy
   changes on Medicare and little change in other entitlements, the
   containment of which we and most other independent observers regard as
   key to long-term fiscal sustainability.

   Our opinion is that elected officials remain wary of tackling
   the structural issues required to effectively address the rising U.S.
   public debt burden in a manner consistent with a `AAA' rating and with
   `AAA' rated sovereign peers (see Sovereign Government Rating
   Methodology and Assumptions," June 30, 2011, especially Paragraphs
   36-41). In our view, the difficulty in framing a consensus on fiscal
   policy weakens the government's ability to manage public finances and
   diverts attention from the debate over how to achieve more balanced and
   dynamic economic growth in an era of fiscal stringency and
   private-sector deleveraging (ibid). A new political consensus might (or
   might not) emerge after the 2012 elections, but we believe that
   by then, the government debt burden will likely be higher, the needed
   medium-term fiscal adjustment potentially greater, and the inflection
   point on the U.S. population's demographics and other age-related
   spending drivers closer at hand (see "Global Aging 2011: In The U.S.,
   Going Gray Will Likely Cost Even More Green, Now," June 21, 2011).

   Standard & Poor's takes no position on the mix of spending and
   revenue measures that Congress and the Administration might conclude is
   appropriate for putting the U.S.'s finances on a sustainable footing.

   The act calls for as much as $2.4 trillion of reductions in
   expenditure growth over the 10 years through 2021. These cuts will be
   implemented in two steps: the $917 billion agreed to initially,
   followed by an additional $1.5 trillion that the newly formed
   Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction is supposed
   to recommend by November 2011. The act contains no measures to raise
   taxes or otherwise enhance revenues, though the committee could
   recommend them.

   The act further provides that if Congress does not enact the
   committee's recommendations, cuts of $1.2 trillion will be implemented
   over the same time period. The reductions would mainly affect outlays
   for civilian discretionary spending, defense, and Medicare. We
   understand that this fall-back mechanism is designed to encourage
   Congress to embrace a more balanced mix of expenditure savings, as the
   committee might recommend.

   We note that in a letter to Congress on Aug. 1, 2011, the
   Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated total budgetary savings
   under the act to be at least $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years
   relative to its baseline assumptions. In updating our own fiscal
   projections, with certain modifications outlined below, we have relied
   on the CBO's latest "Alternate Fiscal Scenario" of June 2011, updated
   to include the CBO assumptions contained in its Aug. 1 letter to
   Congress. In general, the CBO's "Alternate Fiscal Scenario" assumes a
   continuation of recent Congressional action overriding existing law.

   We view the act's measures as a step toward fiscal
   consolidation. However, this is within the framework of a legislative
   mechanism that leaves open the details of what is finally agreed to
   until the end of 2011, and Congress and the Administration could modify
   any agreement in the future. Even assuming that at least $2.1 trillion
   of the spending reductions the act envisages are implemented, we
   maintain our view that the U.S. net general government debt burden (all
   levels of government combined, excluding liquid financial assets) will
   likely continue to grow. Under our revised base case fiscal
   scenario-which we consider to be consistent with a `AA+'
   long-term rating and a negative outlook-we now project that net general
   government debt would rise from an estimated 74% of GDP by the end of
   2011 to 79% in 2015 and 85% by 2021. Even the projected 2015 ratio of
   sovereign indebtedness is high in relation to those of peer credits
   and, as noted, would continue to rise under the act's revised policy
   settings.

   Compared with previous projections, our revised base case scenario
   now assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, due to expire by the end
   of 2012, remain in place. We have changed our assumption on this
   because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any
   measure that would raise revenues, a position we believe Congress
   reinforced by passing the act. Key macroeconomic assumptions in the
   base case scenario include trend real GDP growth of 3% and consumer
   price inflation near 2% annually over the decade.

   Our revised upside scenario-which, other things being equal, we view
   as consistent with the outlook on the `AA+' long-term rating being
   revised to stable-retains these same macroeconomic assumptions. In
   addition, it incorporates $950 billion of new revenues on the
   assumption that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for high earners lapse from
   2013 onwards, as the Administration is advocating. In this scenario, we
   project that the net general government debt would rise from an
   estimated 74% of GDP by the end of 2011 to 77% in 2015 and to 78% by
   2021.

   Our revised downside scenario-which, other things being equal, we
   view as being consistent with a possible further downgrade to a `AA'
   long-term rating-features less-favorable macroeconomic assumptions, as
   outlined below and also assumes that the second round of spending cuts
   (at least $1.2 trillion) that the act calls for does not occur. This
   scenario also assumes somewhat higher nominal interest rates for U.S.
   Treasuries. We still believe that the role of the U.S. dollar as the
   key reserve currency confers a government funding advantage, one that
   could change only slowly over time, and that Fed policy might lean
   toward continued loose monetary policy at a time of fiscal tightening.
   Nonetheless, it is possible that interest rates could rise if investors
   re-price relative risks. As a result, our alternate scenario factors in
   a 50 basis point (bp)-75 bp rise in 10-year bond yields relative to the
   base and upside cases from 2013 onwards. In this scenario, we project
   the net public debt burden would rise from 74% of GDP in 2011 to 90% in
   2015 and to 101% by 2021.

   Our revised scenarios also take into account the significant
   negative revisions to historical GDP data that the Bureau of Economic
   Analysis announced on July 29. From our perspective, the effect of
   these revisions underscores two related points when evaluating the
   likely debt trajectory of the U.S. government. First, the revisions
   show that the recent recession was deeper than previously assumed, so
   the GDP this year is lower than previously thought in both nominal and
   real terms. Consequently, the debt burden is slightly higher. Second,
   the revised data highlight the sub-par path of the current economic
   recovery when compared with rebounds following previous post-war
   recessions. We believe the sluggish pace of the current
   economic recovery could be consistent with the experiences of countries
   that have had financial crises in which the slow process of debt
   deleveraging in the private sector leads to a persistent drag on
   demand. As a result, our downside case scenario assumes relatively
   modest real trend GDP growth of 2.5% and inflation of near 1.5%
   annually going forward.

   When comparing the U.S. to sovereigns with `AAA' long-term ratings
   that we view as relevant peers-Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K.-we
   also observe, based on our base case scenarios for each, that the
   trajectory of the U.S.'s net public debt is diverging from the others.
   Including the U.S., we estimate that these five sovereigns will have
   net general government debt to GDP ratios this year ranging from 34%
   (Canada) to 80% (the U.K.), with the U.S. debt burden at 74%. By 2015,
   we project that their net public debt to GDP ratios will range between
   30% (lowest, Canada) and 83% (highest, France), with the U.S. debt
   burden at 79%. However, in contrast with the U.S., we project that the
   net public debt burdens of these other sovereigns will begin
   to decline, either before or by 2015.

   Standard & Poor's transfer T&C assessment of the U.S. remains `AAA'.
   Our T&C assessment reflects our view of the likelihood of the
   sovereign restricting other public and private issuers' access to
   foreign exchange needed to meet debt service. Although in our view the
   credit standing of the U.S. government has deteriorated modestly, we
   see little indication that official interference of this kind is
   entering onto the policy agenda of either Congress or the
   Administration. Consequently, we continue to view this risk as being
   highly remote.

   The outlook on the long-term rating is negative. As our
   downside alternate fiscal scenario illustrates, a higher public debt
   trajectory than we currently assume could lead us to lower the
   long-term rating again. On the other hand, as our upside scenario
   highlights, if the recommendations of the Congressional Joint Select
   Committee on Deficit Reduction-independently or coupled with other
   initiatives, such as the lapsing of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for high
   earners-lead to fiscal consolidation measures beyond the minimum
   mandated, and we believe they are likely to slow the deterioration
   of the government's debt dynamics, the long-term rating could stabilize
   at `AA+'.

   On Monday, we will issue separate releases concerning affected ratings
   in the funds, government-related entities, financial institutions,
   insurance, public finance, and structured finance sectors.

            U.S. media reported that U.S. President Barack Obama next week
            with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talks to
            persuade Israel not to strike at Iran's nuclear facilities
            within the coming months.
            Obama will probably be held on the 5th meeting using the
            visiting Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. By then, Obama will
            persuade Netanyahu to wait patiently the effect played by
            sanctions against Iran and conscious with the threat of a
            military strike. The Washington Post quoted a government
            official said, "We are attempting to obtain Israel to try not
            to produce the selection of a military strike" a situation of
            anonymity.
            The report mentioned that Israeli leaders created ??it clear
            that to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability in
            much less time, however the U.S. is worried that Israel's
            pre-emptive strike action would trigger a regional war within
            the Middle East. Israel had decided to attack on Iran will not
            be issued a warning signal towards the Usa, the U.S.
            government can deny aware of developments in advance, however
            it also limits the United states to defend its military
            installations in the Middle East's capacity.Based on an
            opinion poll carried out in January by the U.S. media, most
            Americans believe that economic sanctions and diplomatic way
            better than military action against Iran. Thus, the Usa and
            Israel for the differences in how to take care of the Iranian
            nuclear concern has elevated. Israel believes Iran is
            developing nuclear weapons and military strikes against the
            window becoming closed whilst the U.S. is no indication that
            Iran is determined to producenuclear weapons, along with the
            significant consequences of military operations, which
            includes Iran's retaliation against the United states, the
            situation in the Middle East instability and also the impact
            of the international economy .
