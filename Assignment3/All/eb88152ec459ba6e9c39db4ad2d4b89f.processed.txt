   The Scientist

   Biomedical researchers have lost a respected source of information--and
   science journalists have lost yet another publication for which they
   can write--with the news that The Scientist will stop publishing
   immediately. The news comes just after the magazine celebrated its
   [74]25th anniversary with a special issue.

   The Scientist was launched as a bi-weekly newspaper in 1986 by Eugene
   Garfield, founder of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI, now
   Thomson Reuters). Based in Washington, D.C., it soon moved to
   Philadelphia, where ISI was located, and later was transformed into a
   monthly print magazine accompanied by daily online news. But Vitek
   Tracz, the scientific publishing entrepreneur who bought the
   publication and who remains its CEO, confirmed today to ScienceInsider
   that with "great sadness, ... we had to close The Scientist." In an
   e-mail, Tracz further writes:

     The only reason is economic - we simply could not find a way to make
     it pay. There is no other reason. It has wonderful and talented
     staff, an audience that likes it, and it succeeded in keeping high
     editorial and production standards for many years. The world is
     turning away from traditional magazines, and our dependence on page
     advertising brought us to this point. There is alas nothing much
     more to say, except to acknowledge the original vision of Eugene
     Garfield, and the work of the many wonderful people over the last 25
     years.

   One of the original champions of the [75]open-access movement, Tracz
   has previously said that he bought The Scientist in part to help
   promote that effort, although the editor at the time, Richard
   Gallagher, largely resisted advocacy. In recent years, Tracz has
   focused much of his attention on the [76]Faculty of 1000 Web site, an
   effort to apply "post-publication peer review" to scientific literature
   using selected researchers in a myriad of disciplines. Just this week,
   the website launched the F1000 Journal Factor, a [77]new attempt to
   rank scientific journals that offers a potential alternative to the
   traditional and controversial metric known as impact factor. Over the
   past year or so, Tracz had sought to more closely integrate the Faculty
   of 1000 with The Scientist.
