   Learning from Steve Ballmer: A Primer for Microsoft's Next CEO
   We live in a blame oriented society which focuses more on finding and
   shooting people as scapegoats and little on understanding the problems
   well enough to not repeat them. Realize that Ballmer was successful at
   a number of things and it is likely whoever replaces him will have the
   same difficulties with new markets Steve did and not be able to do what
   Steve did well as well. To not end up in a worse position than Steve
   did the next CEO will need to win over the Microsoft employees, fix
   indigence so they can improve the quality of their decisions, and
   implement a practice of causal analysis to replace the blame game that
   currently defines the firm. I walk you through this in my second
   ITBueinessEdge Blog post today:
