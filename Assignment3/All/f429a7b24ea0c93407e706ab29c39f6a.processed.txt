Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Review

    1. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(11%2520of%252018)

A Galaxy Tablet That Shines
       With its winning design and good display, the 8-inch version of the
       Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 is an impressive iPad mini alternative, and it
       costs $30 less.
    2. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(1%2520of%252018)

Bigger Is Not Better
       The 10.1-inch version of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 is a
       disappointment. Its screen, camera and overall performance are
       noticeably worse than its competitors.
    3. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(17%2520of%252018)

Remote Control Ability
       All of Samsung's tablets include an infrared port and special apps
       for using them as a TV remote control.
    4. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(10%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 8.0
       The Tab 3 8.0 is slightly more pocketable than the iPad mini.
    5. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(12%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, Back View
       The Tabs come in white and dark brown.
    6. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(13%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, Top View
       Here's the headphone jack.
    7. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(14%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, Left Side
       The microSD card is on the side.
    8. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(15%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, Bottom View
       Speakers and the microUSB port are on the bottom.
    9. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(16%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, Right Side
       The Right Side has the hard buttons and the infrared port -- a good
       design choice since you'll likely be holding the tablet in
       landscape mode while watching TV.
   10. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(2%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 10.1
       The screen of 10.1-inch model is the same resolution as the Tab 3
       8.0, but since it's larger, it doesn't look as good.
   11. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(3%2520of%252018)

Lag
       In addition to its spec shortcomings, the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 has a
       noticeable lag in overall response time.
   12. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(4%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, Right Side
       Unlike the previous Tab 10.1, speakers are on the side.
   13. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(5%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, Bottom
       The new Tabs all use a microUSB connector, ditching the old
       proprietary one -- a great improvement.
   14. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(6%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, Left Side
       Headphone jack is over here.
   15. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(7%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, Top View
       The top of the tablet has the infrared port, hard buttons and the
       microSD card slot.
   16. Samsung%2520tablets%2520(9%2520of%252018)

Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, Back
       The plastic back of the 10.1 keeps the weight down, but it makes
       the device feel cheap.

   Editor's Note: The awarding of Mashable Choice to the Samsung Galaxy
   Tab 3 applies only to the 8-inch model.

   If [49]Samsung's aim was to supply cheaper alternatives to Apple's
   [50]iPad and [51]iPad mini as a way of gaining elusive tablet market
   share, it succeeded with its recent 10.1- and 8-inch Tab 3 tablets. But
   when I say "cheaper," I mean inferior for one of the Tab 3s and merely
   "less expensive" for the other.

   Three feature additions mark this [52]third generation of Samsung
   tablets (which also includes a 7-inch model that we didn't get a chance
   to test):
    1. The company has finally ditched its ridiculous proprietary
       charge/sync jack in favor of the near-universal microUSB.
    2. An IR emitter and the company's WatchON program guide app lets you
       use the tablet as an advanced TV remote.
    3. The addition of a few of the most prominent features from its
       popular Galaxy S4 smartphones.

   As far as the Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 is concerned, these improvements and
   its low price ($399.99, marked down to $379.99) do not make up for
   fatal camera and shortcomings with screen resolutions and battery life.
   But these fresh attributes combined with its low $299.99 price makes
   the 8-inch Galaxy Tab 3 a worthy -- and only -- alternative to the iPad
   mini at $30 more.

Physical Features

   Samsung's ongoing tablet quality perception problems stems from their
   plastic housing, especially on the 10.1 model. On the larger tablet,
   the thin, light plastic casing makes the tablet feel flimsy and, yes,
   cheap, especially when compared to iPad.

   The casing differences between the 8-inch Tab 3 compared to the iPad
   mini are not as stark, although its looks are more readily marred by
   visible fingerprints, at least on the black versions.

   Unlike the iPad, Samsung recognizes you'll use its Galaxy Tab 10.1
   tablet mostly in landscape mode rather than portrait. Like Samsung's
   previous Tab incarnations, the Tab 3 10.1's Home button is beneath the
   screen when held horizontally, and buttons for on/off and volume as
   well as the microSD card slot are located on the opposite top
   perimeter.

   One unwelcome change between the [54]Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and the Tab 3
   10.1 is the speaker placement. On the previous-generation Galaxy Tabs,
   the twin stereo speakers faced front on either side of the screen. But
   for the Tab 3 the speakers are moved to the rim, which means you may
   block one or both with your hands when you hold the device.

   While nearly exactly as flat as the iPad mini (0.28 inches thin), the
   0.27 inch thin Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is about a half inch taller than the
   mini and a half-inch less wide. The practical benefit is pocketability.
   While both fit in most jacket pockets, Tab 3 8.0's slightly slimmer
   profile makes it less snug of a fit, so it slips in and out a little
   more smoothly.

   Like the iPad mini, the Tab 3 8.0's twin speakers are placed on the
   bottom rim, the same arrangement as on the [55]7-inch Tab 2, which
   means you hear movie sound only through one side. Other less
   technically adept tablet makers have managed to place speakers on
   either side of the screen, so it's a bit annoying when a tablet maker
   with market-leadership aspirations doesn't.

Screen Sights

   Both Tab 3s feature 1,280 x 800 screens, which good news for the 8 inch
   model -- you get 189 pixels per inch (ppi), higher than iPad mini's 163
   ppi (although a [56]Retina iPad Mini is rumored).

   But this resolution is bad news for the 10.1 Tab 3. With its larger
   screen, the 10.1 provides only 149 ppi. As a result, standard text
   fonts on ebooks and web pages are fuzzy and sometimes noticeably
   jagged, and tiny text on full HTML pages is nearly indecipherable.

   Samsung has added 0.1-inch of screen area to the 8-incher compared to
   the 7.9-inch screen on the iPad mini, which amounts to nothing. But Tab
   3 8.0's screen is more oblong, which means widescreen movies actually
   appear larger since the screen's shape conforms more closely to a
   widescreen movie, lessening the letterboxing effect you'd get on the
   iPad mini.

   A taller screen means you also get longer Web pages and, depending on
   the font, font size and line spacing, you get a couple of extra lines
   per page while e-reading, which translates into fewer page turns than
   on smaller screen tablets.

The Tablet as Your Remote Control

   All three Tab 3s are joining a small fraternity of tablets with a
   built-in infrared (IR) emitter for AV remote control. Pre-installed on
   all three is Samsung's WatchON app (and, oddly, the similar Peel Smart
   Remote app) to control your TV and cable/satellite set-top box and make
   viewing suggestions.
   Via Wi-Fi, you can also switch content between tablet and smart TV and
   vice versa using a Samsung-specific Wi-Fi-based technology (not
   Miracast). While I understand moving content from tablet to TV, I'm not
   sure under what conditions you'd do the reverse.

   The IR blaster on both the 8- and 10.1-inch Tab 3s are located along
   the horizontal rim -- logical for the larger tablet but not for the
   smaller since, as previously noted, it's laid out to be held
   vertically. It'd also be easier to handle and manipulate the 8-incher
   with one hand if the IR blaster were at the top rather the side.

   Samsung Tablet Remote

   Personally, I'm not a fan of touchscreen remote controls - you can't
   operate them without looking at them. And because of their size,
   especially on the 10.1, a tablet makes an even more awkward touchscreen
   remote. WatchON is handy to get a capsule of what's currently on TV
   and, after you set some favorites, what you might find interesting to
   watch coming up.

   But WatchON is ultimately neutered as an everyday tool because it
   doesn't offer full remote replacement -- it controls ONLY your TV and
   set-top box, no other A/V components. And compared to other remote
   controls, the tablet's otherwise adequate battery life limits its daily
   usefulness.

Samsung Features and Apps

   Among the Galaxy S4 functions ported to these tabs are the Siri-like S
   Voice, photo organizer and photo book creator Story Album and the
   traveler-must-have S Translator (although this app is handier on a
   handset than on a tablet).

   While there's no eye-tracking Smart Pause or Smart Scrolling,
   supposedly the screens on both tablets stay lit as long as you're
   looking at it -- except for me, apparently. I kept getting an "Eyes Not
   Detected" message. Was it my glasses?

   In addition to the usual Android Google Play app store is Samsung's own
   Samsung Apps store. Why two app stores? You may have heard Android is
   rife with malware, many transported to your device via open apps from
   less than reputable sources in third-party app stores. A few malware
   apps have even [57]showed up in Google Play. Samsung's own app store
   is, like Apple's App Store, curated, which means the apps within are
   safe for worry-free downloading. Plus, the Samsung app store recommends
   apps that are optimized for your specific Samsung device.

Performance

   Each of the Tabs is endowed with a quad-core processor, a 1.6GHz in the
   10.1 and a 1.5GHz in the 8. While the Tab 3 8.0 ran smoothly, the 10.1
   seemed occasionally... hesitant. There were infrequent, barely
   perceptible, almost subconscious, lags between tapping and action, sort
   as if the Tab 3 wanted to take a breath before reacting.

   While both tabs sport 1.3-megapixel front-facing imagers, the 8-incher
   includes a barely adequate 5MP rear camera, and the 10.1 a wholly
   inadequate 3.2MP. It's stunning and disappointing to find any modern
   mobile device, and especially one from a company as esteemed as
   Samsung, to offer such a low-resolution camera.

   The most noticeable performance difference between the two Tab 3s is
   battery life. While the 8-incher lasts for a respectable 9 hours or so,
   the 10.1 didn't last even five hours, a totally woeful and unacceptable
   life-span, regardless of price or additional functions.

Split Tab

   If you're looking for an Android alternative to the slightly more
   expensive Apple iPad mini, I heartily recommend the Tab 3 8.0. But with
   its short battery life, low screen resolution, in adequate camera and
   noticeable lag, the 10.1 Tab 3 is a disappointment.

The Lowdown

Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1

   What's Good:
     * Lightweight
     * IR blaster for TV remote

   What's Bad:
     * Lame camera
     * Low-resolution screen
     * Noticeable lag

Samsung Tab 3 8.0

   What's Good:
     * More pocketable than iPad mini
     * Higher ppi than iPad mini
     * IR blaster for TV remote

   What's Bad:
     * speakers mounted on one side

   Bottom Line: The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 challenges the iPad mini with
   a slightly better screen and a somewhat useful remote-control ability,
   but the 10.1-inch version is a poor tablet whose screen, camera and
   overall performance are lacking.
