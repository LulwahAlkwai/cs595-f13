Google+ is the social backbone

There's a lot more to Google+ than a challenge to Facebook

   [22]Google Plus Google Plus The launch of [23]Google+ is the beginning
   of a fundamental change on the web. A change that will tear down silos,
   empower users and create opportunities to take software and
   collaboration to new levels.

   Social features will become pervasive, and fundamental to our
   interaction with networked services. Collaboration from within
   applications will be as natural to us as searching for answers on the
   web is today.

It's not just about Google vs Facebook

   Much attention has focused on Google+ as a [24]Facebook competitor, but
   to view the system solely within that context is short-sighted. The
   consequences of the launch of Google+ are wider-reaching, more exciting
   and undoubtedly more controversial.

   Google+ is the rapidly growing seed of a web-wide social backbone, and
   the catalyst for the ultimate uniting of the social graph. All it will
   take on Google's part is a step of openness to bring about such a
   commoditization of the social layer. This would not only be
   egalitarian, but would also be the most effective competitive measure
   against Facebook.

   As web search connects people to documents across the web, the social
   backbone connects people to each other directly, across the full span
   of web-wide activity. (For the avoidance of doubt, I take "web" to
   include networked phone and tablet applications, even if the web use is
   invisible to the user.)

   Search removed the need to remember domain names and URLs. It's a
   superior way to locate content. The social backbone will relieve our
   need to manage email addresses and save us laborious "friending" and
   permission-granting activity -- in addition to providing other common
   services such as notification and sharing.

   Though Google+ is the work of one company, there are good reasons to
   herald it as the start of a commodity social layer for the Internet.
   Google decided to make Google+ be part of the web and not a walled
   garden. There is good reason to think that represents an inclination to
   openness and interoperation, as I explain below.

It's time for the social layer to become a commodity

   We're now several years into the era of social networks. Companies have
   come and gone, trying to capture the social graph and exploit it. Well
   intentioned but doomed grass-roots initiatives have waxed and waned.
   Facebook has won the platform game, being the dominant owner of our
   social attention, albeit mostly limited to non-workplace application.

   What does this activity in social software mean? Clearly, social
   features are important to us as users of computers. We like to identify
   our friends, share with them, and meet with them. And it's not just
   friends. We want to identify co-workers, family, sales prospects,
   interesting celebrities.

   Currently, we have all these groups siloed. Because we have many
   different contexts and levels of intimacy with people in these groups,
   we're inclined to use different systems to interact with them. Facebook
   for gaming, friends and family. [28]LinkedIn for customers, recruiters,
   sales prospects. [29]Twitter for friends and celebrities. And so on
   into specialist communities: [30]Instagram and [31]Flickr, [32]Yammer
   or [33]Salesforce Chatter for co-workers.

   The situation is reminiscent of electronic mail before it became
   standardized. Differing semi-interoperable systems, many as walled
   gardens. Business plans predicated on somehow "owning" the social
   graph. The social software scene is filled with systems that assume a
   closed world, making them more easily managed as businesses, but
   ultimately providing for an uncomfortable interface with the reality of
   user need.

   An interoperable email system created widespread benefit, and permitted
   many ecosystems to emerge on top of it, both formal and ad-hoc. Email
   reduced distance and time between people, enabling rapid iteration of
   ideas, collaboration and community formation. For example, it's hard to
   imagine the open source revolution without email.

   When the social layer becomes a standard facility, available to any
   application, we'll release ourselves into a world of enhanced
   diversity, productivity and creative opportunity. Though we don't labor
   as much under the constraints of distance or time as we did before
   email, we are confined by boundaries of data silos. Our information is
   owned by others, we cannot readily share what is ours, and
   collaboration is still mostly boxed by the confines of an application's
   ability.

   A social backbone would also be a boost for diversity. Communities of
   interest would be enabled by the ready availability of social
   networking, without having the heavy lifting in creating the community,
   or run the risk of disapproval or censorship from a controlling
   enterprise.

   The effect of email interoperability didn't just stop at enabling
   communication: it was a catalyst for standards in document formats and
   richer collaboration. The social backbone won't just make it easier to
   handle permissions, identity and sharing, but will naturally exert
   pressure for further interoperation between applications. Once their
   identity is united across applications, users will expect their data to
   travel as well.

   We see already a leaning toward this interoperability: the use of
   Twitter, Facebook and Google as sign-on mechanisms across websites and
   games, attempts to federate and intermingle social software,
   cloud-based identity and wallet services.

What a social backbone would do

   As users, what can we expect a social backbone to do for us? The point
   is to help computers serve us better. We naturally work in contexts
   that involve not only documents and information, but groups of people.
   When working with others, the faster and higher bandwidth the
   communication, the better.

   To give some examples, consider workplace collaboration. Today's
   groupware solutions are closed worlds. It's impractical for them to
   encompass either a particularly flexible social model, or a rich enough
   variety of applications and content, so they support a restricted set
   of processes. A social backbone could make groupware out of every
   application. For the future Photoshop, iMovie and Excel, it adds the
   equivalent power of calling someone over and saying "Hey, what about
   this?"

   Or think about people you interact with. When you're with someone,
   everything you're currently doing with them is important. Let's say
   you're working with your friend Jane on the school's PTA fundraiser,
   and her and your kids play together. Drag Jane into your PTA and
   Playdates circles. Drop a letter to parents into the PTA circle, and
   your calendar's free/busy info into Playdates.

   Now you're sharing information both of you need. Next Thursday you see
   Jane at school. While you're chatting, naturally the topic of playdates
   and the PTA come up. You bring up Jane on your phone, and there are
   links right there to the letter you're writing, and some suggested
   dates for mutually free time.

   Teaching computer systems about who we know lets them make better
   guesses as to what we need to know, and when. My examples are merely
   simple increases in convenience. The history of computing frequently
   shows that once a platform is opened up, the creative achievements of
   others far exceed those dreamed of by the platform's progenitors.

   The social backbone democratizes social software: developers are freed
   from the limitations of walled gardens, and the power to control what
   you do with your friends and colleagues is returned to you, the user.

Social backbone services

   Which services will the social backbone provide? We can extract these
   from those provided by today's web and social software applications:
     * Identity -- authenticating you as a user, and storing information
       about you
     * Sharing -- access rights over content
     * Notification -- informing users of changes to content or contacts'
       content
     * Annotation -- commenting on content
     * Communication -- direct interaction among members of the system

   These facilities are not new requirements. Each of them have been met
   in differing ways by existing services. Google and [34]Amazon serve as
   identity brokers with a reasonable degree of assurance, as do Twitter
   and Facebook, albeit with a lesser degree of trust.

   A host of web services address sharing of content, though mostly
   focused on sharing the read permission, rather than the edit
   permission. Notification originated with email, graduated through RSS,
   and is now a major part of Twitter's significance, as well as a
   fundamental feature of Facebook. Annotation is as old as the web,
   embodied by the hyperlink, but has been most usefully realized through
   blogging, [35]Disqus, Twitter and Facebook commenting. Communication
   between users has been around as long as multi-user operating systems,
   but is most usefully implemented today in Facebook chat and instant
   messaging, where ad-hoc groups can easily be formed.

Why not Facebook?

   Unfortunately, each of today's answers to providing these social
   facilities are limited by their implementation. Facebook provides the
   most rounded complement of social features, so it's a reasonable
   question to ask why Facebook itself can't provide the social backbone
   for the Internet.

   Facebook's chief flaw is that is a closed platform. Facebook does not
   want to be the web. It would like to draw web citizens into itself, so
   it plays on the web, but in terms that leave no room for doubt where
   the power lies. Content items in Facebook do not have a URI, so by
   definition can never be part of the broader web. If you want to use
   Facebook's social layer, you must be part of and subject to the
   Facebook platform.

   Additionally, there are issues with the symmetry of Facebook's
   friending model: it just doesn't model real life situations. Even the
   term "friend" doesn't allow for the nuance that a capable web-wide
   social backbone needs.

   This is not to set up a Facebook vs Google+ discussion, but to
   highlight that Facebook doesn't meet the needs of a global social
   backbone.

Why Google+?

   Why is Google+ is the genesis of a social backbone? The simple answer
   is that it's the first system to combine a flexible enough social model
   with a widespread user base, and a company for whom exclusive ownership
   of the social graph isn't essential to their business.

   Google also has the power to bootstrap Google+ as a social backbone:
   the integration of Google+ into Google's own web applications would be
   a powerful proving ground and advertisement for the concept.

   Yet one company alone should not have the power to manage identity for
   everyone. A workable and safe social backbone must support competition
   and choice, while still retaining the benefits of the network. Email
   interoperability was created not by the domination of one system, but
   by standards for communication.

   To achieve a web-wide effect, Google+ needs more openness and
   interoperability, which it does not yet have. The features offered by
   the upcoming [36]Google+ API will give us a strong indication of
   Google's attitude towards control and interoperability.

   There is some substantial evidence that Google would support an open
   and interoperable social backbone:
     * Google's prominence as a supporter of the open web, which is
       crucial to its business.
     * The early inclination to interoperation of Google+: public content
       items have a URI, fallback to email is supported for contacts who
       are not Google+ members.
     * Google is loudly trumpeting their [37]Data Liberation Front,
       committed to giving users full access to their own data.
     * Google has been involved in the creation of, or has supported,
       early stage technologies that address portions of the social
       backbone, including OAuth, OpenID, OpenSocial, PubSubHubbub.
     * Google displays an openness to federation with interoperating
       systems, [38]evinced most keenly by Joseph Smarr, the engineer
       behind the Google+ Circles model. The ill-fated Google Wave
       incorporated federation.
     * The most open system possible would best benefit Google's mission
       in organizing the world's information, and their business in
       targeting relevant advertising.

Toward the social backbone

   Computers ought to serve us and provide us with means of expression.

   A common, expressive and interoperable social backbone will help users
   and software developers alike. Liberated from information silos and
   repeat labor of curating friends and acquaintances, we will be free to
   collaborate more freely. Applications will be better able to serve us
   as individuals, not as an abstract class of "users".

   The road to the social backbone must be carefully trodden, with privacy
   a major issue. There is a tough trade-off between providing usable
   systems and those with enough nuance to sufficiently meet our models of
   collaboration and sharing.

   Obstacles notwithstanding, Google+ represents the promise of a next
   generation of social software. Incorporating learnings from previous
   failures, a smattering of innovation, and a close attention to user
   need, it is already a success.

   It requires only one further step of openness to take the Google+
   product into the beginnings of a social backbone. By taking that step,
   Google will contribute as much to humanity as it has with search.

       This is the first article that I've read that really understands
       what is Google+ aiming for.
       Facebook has a design flaw - in it you can't have a middle ground
       (persons are your friends or aren't your friends) so people are
       afraid of a privacy debacle and don't reproduce in it your real
       life social network. Because of this constraint Facebook is used
       this way:
       a) People only add (or tend to had) their closest friends;
       b) People only share a really small subset of things.
       These things tend to reinforce each other to diminish the value of
       Facebook's social graph - Facebook only knows a specific set of
       your social graph and a specific set of your interactions. You can
       say that Facebook now has groups and lists but they aren't a core
       part of the Facebook experience hence it isn't a natural way to use
       Facebook.
       Google+ is built to manage and to allow every (or almost every)
       type of social interaction that you have.
       That's why the circles feature is so important - because it allows
       you to structure your social graph as you structure your real life
       social network. And core to the Google+ and the circles feature is
       the notion of privacy.
       Check Google+ Help and you can see that the word "privacy" or "who
       can see your post, photo, etc" is pervasive in every feature of the
       service.
       Google understands that only by going this route it can beat
       Facebook in the social network space - by mimicking your real life
       social network.

       I'll admit, I didn't read this entire article. But from I see it's
       largely conjecture.
       People have to use it first and the vast majority of people won't
       for some time. If Google+ is to be the "backbone" of a social
       infrastructure then it has a long way to go. Right now what we have
       is a stem cell and pontificating as to what it's going to turn
       into. There's a lot of possibilities. It could be a huge success or
       a big failure. My issue is that Google, save for the search engine
       and perhaps GMail, doesn't exactly have a track record of creating
       things people flock to.

       I'm still taking this in - this is huge! While I really like the

       Googles primary objective at this stage. Organising the Social
       Graph is going to take decades - if they are doing as you predict
       i'd like to think we are on the cusp of true Social indexing.

       It's going to become so "open" it will be impossible to have any

     * Alex Tolley
       I'd like to see more concrete examples of what the social backbone
       will offer users, rather than the sort of vague ideas expressed
       here. I accept that perhaps this is unknowable until people use it
       and develop it.
       I'd certainly like to see more utility in the social web than just
       more chatter (noise), with better ways to condense the chatter and
       extract useful information about things I want to know about or do.
       If the Google+ API facilitates this, then I would be very
       interested in Google+ as more than a Facebook competitor, which is
       really where it stands today, despite teh hints of the future
       presented by this post.
     * http://radar.oreilly.com/edd Edd Dumbill
       @Alex Tolley, agree with the need for more examples. I want to
       develop the idea further and examine the consequences of extending
       an interoperable social layer into the web.
     * http://www.wohl.com Amy Wohl
       This is a great article with very interesting implications. I think
       of Facebook as something I go to in response to someone asking me
       to do something. I don't trust it very much -- for instance, I
       won't use any application that requires me to "share" my friends
       list because most of my list is business associates.
       On the other hand, I post to my groups on Linked-In all the time,
       but it's another walled garden.
       If google+ lets me have my privacy and the privacy of my friends, I
       think it will be an incredible success. It doesn't have to do
       everything all at once -- evolution is better since it gives the
       google designers time to see how their users react to new features
       and refine or, if necessary discard.
       I can't wait to see my social lists migrate to google+.

       I hate facebook and I hate google+. I do not want to be connected.

       Please stop encouraging these things.
     * David Sims
       I fear I'm holding onto an attitude that is quickly becoming
       unfashionable: I rather like my silos. At worst, this could be seen
       as my being comfortable with duplicity: do I pretend to be one
       person at work and another in the neighborhood? But at its best,
       it's merely tailoring the content to the audience: I don't pretend
       to believe that my wine and music friends care about the same
       issues that my techie friends do -- and neither care much about my
       history geekiness. It's my experience that the broader my audience,
       the less personal my posts. So far, I find that while Google+ and
       Facebook both offer ways to segment posts to specific audiences,
       neither does a very good job of making that clear visually in a way
       that reassures you're speaking only to whom you think you are. I'd
       like to see either service improve that aspect. Save the silos.
     * tcope
       I think the article it to vauge. It does not say much. Google will
       use GP to target ads, as their search engine does, but using more
       personal info. This is what Google gets out of it. FB is 100% and
       not a social network. Its the opposite. It uses "friends" to spam
       other "friends". Drop the business's creating pages and FB fails.
       GP allows people to comminicate. They dont need to spam as Google
       makes money from targeting ads to your account info. Google can
       piggy back services.. FB cannot. FB will fail starting 6 months and
       be gone in 12.

       ok, so this is what Google+ is really about. Has anyone stopped to
       ask what this will mean to identity, privacy, and social roles in
       the future?
       There is already a backlash against Facebook for
       oversharing/invasion of content. What will happen when a single
       "social backbone" integrates cumbersome privacy and sharing
       controls with social search result data.
       I've said this before, and I'll say it again. Until Google answers
       the question of how to get Grandma/Grandpa in line to sign up,
       they'll have missed the mark. Google+ is still exclusive because of
       how it uses technology, and it'll be at least a generation before
       that changes. Until then, Google+ is just another social network I
       don't have time to monitor.
     * http://maffulli.net Stefano Maffulli
       The most important sentence of the articles IMHO is
       (Google is) a company for whom exclusive ownership of the social
       graph isn't essential to their business
       Crucial point and that's why I think Google should soon enable
       Google+ to work in a federated way, much like Wave, as [52]I wrote.
       Imagine having the possibility to run your own Plus-like service
       and still be able to comment on your brother's pictures on his own
       server. Google is the only company that can do this and still
       profit from it.

       Really nice narrative style. Enjoyable read. My only nit is that
       there is a tendency to:
       A) default into the meme that "open will prevail" when the data
       doesn't support that fact and; B) give google credit for being
       preternaturally open, when they are really open-ish, which is to
       say that they are open on what they want to commoditize but
       relatively closed where they want to monetize.
       That said, count me in. I want a social backbone to promulgate. :-)

       Whether Google will help us fulfill the potential of an open social
       graph is still an open question. What is not, is the revolutionary
       impact that a truly open, programmable social graph would have.
       When applications can assume access to an open social graph, it
       will change what is and is not possible. I've taken a crack at what
       it might look like to deeply integrate CRM databases with our
       social graphs - a deeper kind of "social CRM" :
       [54]http://www.alchemyofchange.net/friend-discovery/

       Google, then who?

       I agree with the overall take on the fundamental potential of
       Google Plus as a more flexible framework than Facebook expressed in
       this article.
       As I am interested in the platform realizing its full potential, I
       will offer up two improvements which I think Google Plus really
       needs, and which would greatly help it achieve that potential.
       1. Fix the `no-reply' nature of notification emails ! For such a
       flexible and versatile networking `backbone', the kind of `cold
       water' in the face that occurs when one, instinctively, replies to
       a notification email sent by someone using Google plus, only to
       discover, after receiving a MAILER-DAEMON error message, that the
       attempt to respond to a communication was stuffed into the garbage
       bin.
       Ostensibly, G+ would like to get people using email to use G+
       directly. However, that goes against the grain of the potential for
       G+ as an open medium for integrating interpersonal exchange with
       open access to the information resource of the Web.
       I think there is a reasonably good protocol for dealing with email
       replies to notifications which are message posts (as opposed to G+
       administrative messages along the lines of `someone has added
       you').
       To wit: instead of `no-reply', a reply by someone receiving a post
       via email could
       1) simply be routed to the sender's email account;
       2) show up in the incoming stream of the sender
       3) if the incoming stream is not private, but visible/public, then,
       so as not to expose someone responding via email who has not yet
       agreed to have their comments posted to a wider audience other than
       the intended reply to the poster, another stream category could be
       created (`aux in') designed to receive messages sent to the G+
       account from outside G+
       4) if a G+ user *prefers* to interact asynchronously with G+ via
       email as opposed to `interactively' with the G+ online dialog, then
       the reply could conceivably be posted as a reply to the senders G+
       stream to which the sender originally invoked, as a comment to that
       post
       I seriously think that having `no-reply' messages delivered to
       email-only recipients will cause a significant loss in G+ adoption.

       "A social backbone could make groupware out of every application.
       For the future Photoshop, iMovie and Excel, it adds the equivalent
       power of calling someone over and saying "Hey, what about this?""
       What about the children? What about the poor starving artists? what
       about the content industries that so studiously support these
       starving artists? What about all the people at the TV studios,
       Movie studios and Record labels, whose lives, and livelihoods, are
       dependant on people not collaborating and sharing?
       Other than the children, I say screw them all, and good riddance.

       Tom from MySpace just tweeted this video about Mark Zuckerberg's
       reaction to Google+
       [55]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9MtttXI2q8
     * http://tola.me.uk Ben Francis
       Powerful article, but perhaps a little premature.
       For a "social backbone" to exist it would have to be based on a
       distributed social network from multiple providers using open
       standards for federation (similar to how email works).
       So far there's no way to federate the social graph in Google+ in a
       standard way and more than you can with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn
       etc. - it's just another silo with a UI that has a bit of an edge,
       for now.
       It is true that out of all of those companies Google has the least
       to lose and the most to gain by opening up and commoditising the
       social web, and it would be consistent with their mission and
       precedents set in other areas. But they're not there yet.
       Google+ needs to support open standards like OStatus or its
       successor in order for this to become a reality.
     * http://cloud-krbabu.blogspot.com K Ramesh Babu
       In the vision of a silo-free social layer presented here, I see the
       opportunity for the computing network to promote universal
       brotherhood, somewhat akin to the way it is presented in Vedanta
       circles (sic). µ¸¦µ ®¬®. Rough literal translation: There is only
       one family, and that consists of all beings on earth.

       Google +. I can tell you are a big fan of them by your article. G+
       will probably do really well.
       I sent Google Ventures, and Google Exec's my bus. proposal over 2+
       years ago. Google seems to have read my proposal and has "borrowed"
       some of the things I put in my proposal. Give me 1 million dollars
       and I will show you a "social backbone".
       "Do no evil" Google is all about the money and does not care about
       you the user.
       For once I would like to see a big company help people and show
       that they are not all about the money.

       This is a terrific post, but I don't understand the statement about
       a lack of URIs on Facebook. What is this, if not a Facebook URI?
       [56]http://www.facebook.com/justia/posts/242902062396137I use such
       Facebook identifiers to link to Facebook content several times each
       week.

       Email never cared about context.
     * http://radar.oreilly.com/edd Edd Dumbill
       @Robert Richards, you are right about Facebook posts, they have a
       URI, I stand corrected. Other items that feed through FB don't have
       URIs though, that go under the "activity feed". The argument from
       URI was unnecessary: an argument from Facebook's Terms & Conditions
       would be more illustrative!
     * Sam
       Does Google paid Oreilly to write this post?
       It should be titled SPONSORED POST!
     * Bhuwan Ghimire
       Maxnicks, you were saying?
     * Pipe Dream
       This is a pipe dream. Do you really think Google+ is an "open"
       platform? They are gonna make all their code base and social graph
       public? Google is no different than FB. Both are corporations run
       by boards that want to make money. Neither are "open." Google is no
       less evil than FB. It's just a slightly different approach to the
       same problem; more or less a copy of FB with some improvements. And
       FB will copy G+ in turn.
     * D.Bellini
       It may be too soon to tell. If Google is NOT an open platform, it
       will fail, or at best, compete, with Facebook. I've generally
       stayed away from Goggle offerings (apart from search) because of
       privacy concerns. This is not to say that Facebook is not
       concerning, but it seemed all the hype years back was a bit
       exaggerated-even though it was necessary to provide disclosure and
       expose Facebook's utter disregard for the privacy of its users.
       Yet, the Google giant was basically ignored. Google is so
       integrated and Buzz caused a lot of problems with privacy with the
       `automatic' sharing of one's social graph.
       I also would like an answer to the question above, thus far
       ignored-Is this a sponsored post?
     * http://radar.oreilly.com/edd Edd Dumbill
       @D.Bellini, no, Radar does not carry sponsored posts and I have no
       affiliation with Google.
     * Todd Andelin
       I have been using G+ for a week or so, and I find it to be
       extremely engaging.
       The only reason I am commenting here is to say that I am going over
       to Google+ right now to find Edd Dumbill and to read the comments
       because there it will be easier to engage and follower fellow
       readers.

       I use google+ daily now because I've been able to convince people
       to use it. @Zen Cushion I see your point, my cousin got that
       error...
       "* Sharing -- access rights over content [Check]
       * Notification -- informing users of changes to content or
       contacts' content [Check]
       * Annotation -- commenting on content [Check]
       * Communication -- direct interaction among members of the system
       [Check]"
       It's all been done already
     * William Johnson
       Even if Google's intentions are what you believe... which is still
       an open question... it's hard to see how the inter-application
       collaboration you describe can succeed, as long as people continue
       to use the wide range of proprietary applications (from many
       different vendors) that they're used to. Those programs simply
       don't share the same code architecture, and you can't just stick on
       APIs so they can interoperate with each other across Google+.
       Or do you think that everyone is going to abandon all their
       applications (desktop and Web) for Google Apps? Not any time
       soon...

       The collaborative aspects of G+ seem similar to what Google tried
       to do with Wave, which has not come into wide use, and the social
       interactions seem similar to Buzz, which also did not spread
       prolifically. I will be interested to see how people receive
       Google+ and to see if the masses will look at it as a "social
       backbone" or simply as a Facebook alternative. Interesting post!
     * Andrew
       This article is brilliant.
       However, do you know from Google whether this is their intent?
       Or is their intent merely to replace Facebook with something
       better?
       Would be nice to hear direct from the Googlers' mouths.
