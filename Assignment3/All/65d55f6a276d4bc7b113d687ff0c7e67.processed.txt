[118]The other selfie: a single case study experiment on "clean eating"

   By [119]Kathleen Raven | October 1st, 2013 |  [120]Comments 17
   [121]Bean varieties for sale at a New York City greenmarket.

   Since I began routinely reading Scientific American comments online and
   in the magazine's letters to the editor, I've encountered a recurring
   theme: Readers lament that the celebrated publication isn't as
   scientific as it once was in the fifties or the nineties (depending on
   who is writing). Complaints pile up. Teeth gnash. But no disgruntled
   reader, [...]

[136]Is your nose making you overeat?

   [139]Fruit flies overeat when they smell something tasty; what about
   you?

   Some people are drawn to the thick smell of bacon, sizzling and
   crackling in the skillet on a Saturday morning.  For others, it's the
   aroma of freshly baked cookies on a Friday night or the smell of
   McDonald's fries creeping in through the car window.  At this time of
   year, I find the scent of [...]

[174]Conservation Tillage - A brief instructional video

   By [175]Kathleen Raven | September 27th, 2013 |  [176]Comments 2

   For one year, my Ecology major professor and I met during each of the
   seasons at his teaching farm and lab, Spring Valley EcoFarms, to record
   another crucial step of the conservation tillage process. The video
   below is a product of those meetings. But a film is hardly made by one
   person. I'd like to [...]

[211]Linguistically Modified Foods? How Language May Shape Perception Of GMs

   By [212]Layla Eplett | September 25th, 2013 |  [213]Comments 6
   [214]Alphabet Stew'ing: The language of GM can be confusing.

   As politicians are aware, you betcha language can impact public
   opinion. In the 2012 presidential election, both Barack Obama and Mitt
   Romney had their word selections analyzed. Public reaction was
   sometimes more favorable than others, demonstrating how the power of
   words (or things remotely resembling them) should not
   be misunderestimated. The ability of language to shape public
   perception isn't limited [...]

   Last week, when French researchers unveiled a newly discovered plant
