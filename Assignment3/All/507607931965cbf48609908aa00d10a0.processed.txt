   4 Steps to iPoding the Smartphone Segment
   In a few short days we will be up to our armpits in Smartphones each
   one, including the rumored one from Apple, trying to become the next
   iPod, iPhone, and iPad. With Jobs gone the playing field is far more
   equal than it was in the past so figured I'd document what to look for
   in a winning product. It really needs to be a strong blend of core
   features, design, marketing, and lust. There will be many Smartphones
   but likely only one to rule them all. At least if there is an iPod
   moment, unfortunately it is more likely we be up to our armpits in
   products more like Zune. Column in Shadowtrends this week:
