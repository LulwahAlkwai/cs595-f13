   Meet the McMillans. They're like a lot of families -- young, unmarried,
   with two kids, a boy and a girl -- with [50]one notable exception: They
   live every day like it's 1986. Not in some vague, listen-to-The
   Bangles-and-wear-some-Spandex kind of way, but in a manner that is
   deliberate and drastic and all-encompassing. The McMillans, at home,
   have given up all technology that was introduced to the world after
   1986.

   Yes. Which means: phones, but no iPhones. Videos, but no DVDs. Video
   games, but no Xboxes. Photos, but no Instagrams. TV, but no cable. For
   a year that started in April, the Toronto Sun [51]reports in a profile
   of the '80s-tastic Canadians, the McMillans have been doing their
   banking in person. They've been entertaining themselves with books.
   They took a family road trip this summer, and navigated using paper
   maps -- and kept the kids entertained with coloring books and stickers.

   And their excellent adventure doesn't end with technology. Blair
   McMillan, family patriarch, has doubled down on his Back to the Future
   lifestyle: For one very major thing, he wears a mullet. ("Business in
   front, party in the back," he explains.) His kids do, too.

   So. Yes. You might be asking why a family that is not currently the
   subject of an [52]M. Night Shyamalan movie would adopt a lifestyle that
   is as aggressively retrograde as this one. You might also be wondering
   whether this is a hoax or, at the very least, a [53]Balloon Boy-style
   publicity ploy. It is neither, Blair McMillan insists. While, yes, he's
   considering producing a documentary and/or writing a book about his
   [54]year of living fluorescently, the broader point of the
   technological cutoff, McMillan says, has been to reclaim some of his
   family life from technology. (And it's been working, he insists. The
   kids, probably because they're so young -- 5 and 2 -- have been
   cooperative with the drastic lifestyle change. The "project just to get
   closer and reunite the family," McMillan says, has been "working out
   awesome.")

   The experiment started, he notes, with something that will make the
   McMillans familiar to a lot of families: a vague sense that gadgets
   were cheating their children of their childhoods. Earlier this year,
   Blair McMillan says, he was hanging out outside the house, and he asked
   his 5-year-old son Trey to join him. Trey refused. He was too busy with
   his iPad.

   "That's kind of when it hit me," Blair tells the Sun, "because I'm
   like, wow, when I was a kid, I lived outside."

   That's when Blair and the family matriarch, Morgan, decided to
   drastically de-techify their lives. They gave up their cellphones. They
   deleted their Facebook accounts. They cut the cable. They established a
   box for visitors to stash their phones, tablets and other gadgets while
   hanging out in the McMillan home. And they dealt, in the process, with
   friends and family and business associates who (reasonably) questioned
   their newfound lifestyle choices. While Morgan uses a computer at work,
   Blair, [55]he says, has taken things farther -- to the extent that he's
   lost business. (Imagine if you were reliant on fax machines for
   document transmissions). And he's had trouble getting more work as
   well, because so many workplaces now only accept job applications
   online.

   Then again, Blair points out, the cost of living is reduced when you're
   not paying for cable and Internet and data plans. "It's way cheaper,"
   Blair says. Plus, "everybody just gives me stuff."

   So why 1986 as opposed to, say, the perfectly regressive years that
   were 1985 and 1987? Because 1986 was the year both Blair and Morgan
   were born. "We're parenting our kids the same way we were parented for
   a year just to see what it's like," Blair explains. One concession
   they've kept to the contemporary world, however: their car. The
   McMillans, before April 2013 and after it, have driven a 2010 Kia. But
   they don't use GPS.
