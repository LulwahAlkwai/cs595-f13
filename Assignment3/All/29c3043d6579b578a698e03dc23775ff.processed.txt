   Although [48]Microsoft's [49]clever jabs at Apple over the past year
   have managed to win a few fans, a new parody video, posted by the
   company on Friday, apparently wasn't having the desired effect and has
   now been pulled from YouTube.

   Titled "A fly on the wall in Cupertino?" the video depicts a series of
   fictional meetings held at Apple's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters
   sometime in early 2013. During the meetings, two executives come up
   with various pitches for the new iPhone, directed at two executives
   whose faces remains obscured but seem to resemble Apple design chief
   Jony Ive and the late Steve Jobs.

   'Cheapass'

   However, at one point in the video, the person who resembles Jobs from
   the back is addressed by the nickname "T," indicating that it might
   have been an attempt to depict current Apple CEO Tim Cook.

   While the video starts off with a small dig at the rumored Apple
   "[51]iWatch," from then on the pitches all focus on the new iPhones as
   the executives come up with a number of seemingly flimsy reasons for
   the device's new features. Most of the jokes are directed at the iPhone
   5C for its color choices and polycarbonate shell. The fake execs pitch
   over-the-top sounding colors such as vermilion, chartreuse, and
   "robin's egg blue."

   Later in the video, in what is probably the most direct slap against
   [52]the iPhone 5C, the pitch person says, "Did we have to make the new
   iPhones out of plastic to save money? Yeah bro." At one point, the lead
   pitch person even touches on the iPhone's price, gleefully adding, "And
   the beauty part is we can charge whatever we want."

   No Microsoft branding or mention of the Windows Phone platform appears
   in the video, but the spot does end with a message that reads
   "#timetoswitch." Reactions to the video were mixed, but many commenters
   appear to think that, aside from not being very funny, the video's
   visual reference to Jobs in the video may have been in poor taste.

   The video no longer appears on Microsoft's Windows Phone YouTube
   channel, but a couple of YouTube users managed to capture the
   two-minute spot which, as of this writing, [53]could still be viewed
   online.

   When reached for comment, a Microsoft spokesperson reportedly [55]told
   The Next Web, "The video was intended to be a light-hearted poke at our
   friends from Cupertino. But it was off the mark, and we've decided to
   pull it down."
