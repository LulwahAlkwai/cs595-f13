[121]Understanding Our Moral Tribes

   by Carl Zimmer

   A decade ago, I traveled to Princeton to spend some time with a young
   philosopher who had decided to start scanning people's brains. I was
   working on a book about the history of neurology, called [122]Soul Made
   Flesh, and I was fascinated by how the study of the brain had emerged
   from a scientific attempt to save souls. I wanted to end the book with
   a look at how scientists study the brain 350 years later, and during my
   research I discovered the work of Joshua Greene. He was taking the
   arguments that moral philosophers had developed over many years and
   testing them out on flesh-and-blood brains, monitoring neural activity
   as people worked through moral problems.

   In addition to putting Greene into my book, I ended up writing a
   [123]profile of him called "Whose Life Would You Save?" for Discover
   (which you [124]can also read in a collection of my articles available
   at Byliner). Here's how it starts...

   Dinner with a philosopher is never just dinner, even when it's at an
   obscure Indian restaurant on a quiet side street in Princeton with a
   30-year-old postdoctoral researcher. Joshua Greene is a man who spends
   his days thinking about right and wrong and how we separate the two. He
   has a particular fondness for moral paradoxes, which he collects the
   way some people collect snow globes.

   "Let's say you're walking by a pond and there's a drowning baby, "
   Greene says, over chicken tikka masala. "If you said, `I've just paid
   $200 for these shoes and the water would ruin them, so I won't save the
   baby,' you'd be an awful, horrible person. But there are millions of
   children around the world in the same situation, where just a little
   money for medicine or food could save their lives. And yet we don't
   consider ourselves monsters for having this dinner rather than giving
   the money to Oxfam. Why is that?"

   Philosophers pose this sort of puzzle over dinner every day. What's
   unusual here is what Greene does next to sort out the conundrum. He
   leaves the restaurant, walks down Nassau Street to the building that
   houses Princeton University's psychology department, and says hello to
   graduate student volunteer Nishant Patel. (Greene's volunteers take
   part in his study anonymously; Patel is not his real name.) They walk
   downstairs to the basement, where Patel dumps his keys and wallet and
   shoes in a basket. Greene waves an airport metal-detector paddle up and
   down Patel's legs, then guides him into an adjoining room dominated by
   a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The student lies down on a slab,
   and Greene closes a cagelike device over his head. Pressing a button,
   Greene maneuvers Patel's head into a massive doughnut-shaped magnet.

   Greene headed off to Harvard a couple years later, where he's now an
   associate professor of psychology. Over the years other scientists have
   also taken up the study of moral neuroscience, but Greene still stands
   out among them thanks to the philosophical rigor with which he thinks
   about the nature of morality. Over the years, he's expanded his
   research from the basic biology underpinning morality to the different
   ways that it gets played out in human societies-and how, paradoxically,
   different forms of moralities bring people into conflict.

   So I'm very curious now to check out a book he's written about his
   research and ideas, called [125]Moral Tribes, coming out next month.
   The Edge has a sneak preview of Greene's ideas in the form of a video
   talk by Greene and a transcript. [126]Check it out.

       A small correction: The moral conundrum quoted here was described
       and detailed by Peter Singer. It is in his book `The life you can
       save'. Mr.Greene's ideas (especially his use of the `tragedy of the
       commons and the camera to elucidate them) are extremely interesting
       even if a tad idealistic.
    2. Kudzu
       September 7, 2013
       In regards to the dilemma I would say the baby in the pond
       satisfies 3 conditions we like when acting, it's personal,
       immediate and definite. Kids around the world are impersonal, the
       problems are not immediately solved and you can't be definite that
       what you do saves a specific life.
    3. Rdizzie
       September 8, 2013
       I agree with Kudzu.
       It is not some big mystery or paradox. As kudzu said it is
       impersonal when they are half way around the world. Now if he is
       trying to figure out what part of the brain makes these decisions
       that is cool. But understanding human behavior is not some big
       mystery that people make it. All we have to do is look at human
       history to see the patterns. The old saying "there is nothing new
       under the sun" applies in a great way here. Human behavior has been
       the same for thousands of years.
       Why do I spend 20 dollars on a meal instead of sending it to
       Africa? I have used this same social experiment on my facebook page
       but asking a bit of a different question. I get a lot of people
       posting sick US children on my feed, I always reply with a photo of
       a child killed by US military action. I ask, what about these kids.
       The response is always the same " I do care they are both tragic"
       but these people never again post on the children I showed. Why?
       For 1 obvious reason that does not need tons of grant money to
       answer and takes about 5 seconds of rational thought. The most
       important factor is they have never seen children killed by war, so
       it is impersonal to them. When we cannot personalize a subject we
       cannot empathize, it is also hard to truly sympathize with these
       people. I say sympathize also because we have no understanding of
       their situation. Were a child blown up right in front of us we
       could do these two very important emotional responses. We can't
       even fully pity them or show them compassion. Nor do we feel need
       to because we are not confronted with the problem. This goes back
       to the commercials of starving children, why are they so
       successful? because it is confrontation with reality.
       So the next question is why do they even respond, this also has a
       very basic and simple explanation, it was made public and they had
       to respond in a positive way even though they previously did not
       show concern for the second group of children. Human thought and
       emotion is not some big huge mystery, it is very easy to see why
       people react the way we do. I think the more important question is
       why did we evolve these feeling, not why we act the way we do. Yes
       I made it seem very simple and basic, and that is because it is
       very simple and basic.

       Rdizzie Steven Pinker has written a book, The Better Angels of our
       Nature, which refutes your claim that human behaviour has not
       changed in thousands of years. We are getting better. We are
       learning to over-ride our base primate insticts and behave better
       towards each other. Understanding what we are, apes, and what
       drives us, mostly emotion, allows us to make better decisions by
       not depending on instinct so much as rational thought.

       It's true that all it really takes is to make it personal. As an
       American college student that hadn't been out of the country, I got
       a pretty big culture shock going to poor areas of Peru. It makes
       the rest of the world seem more real, which is something our
       culture lacks in general.
    6. Yaser Jabbar
       September 17, 2013
       I'm afraid I must wholly disagree with the post above.There is
       little evidence that we are getting better and behave better
       towards each other. One need only open a newspaper or your web
       browser for evidence of how we are the same as we were thousands of
       years ago.
    7. David Bump
       September 18, 2013
       I'm with Kudzu and Rdizzie, too. One liberal professor's book
       showing a per capita decrease in violence does not make a proof
       that human nature has changed. Certainly the simplistic formula
       that understanding that we are apes driven by emotion = more
       rational thought = more peace, morality, and a change in nature
       doesn't hold up to critical examination. A number of great changes
       toward peace and equality were made before and apart from
       Enlightenment/Rationalist thinking, let alone before the concept
       that humans are "naked apes." Likewise, a number of violent
       regimes, including the Nazis and various communist regimes, claimed
       to have their roots in such modern, "Enlightened" thinking. Purely
       rational thought can be used to justify all sorts of violence given
       the right circumstances. We scoff at the idea of someone refusing
       to save a baby to spare their expensive shoes, but many people are
       very passionate about defending a woman's right to an abortion at
       any point, for any reason. Some have argued, rationally, that
       abortions should be extended to months after birth. It might even
       be argued, rationally, that our very concepts of such intangibles
       as morality, nobility, love, etc., are superfluous veneers
       generated as side products of the freak mutations that made us the
       bubble-brained threats to the balance of nature.
       The reasons for the drop in per-capita violence are probably
       numerous and interdependent (and I wonder what would happen if we
       included abortion, suicides and other forms of violence that aren't
       traditionally included). I suspect much of it is simply mundane
       changes in circumstances -- no "undiscovered" lands to claim, the
       ratio of disputed to undisputed territory greatly reduced,
       governmental power more distributed, capitalism leading to "others"
       becoming "customers," religions becoming widespread rather than
       limited to specific tribes or exclusive groups, military strategy
       and technology allowing for limited strikes, etc.
