   By Pete Pachal2013-09-17 16:01:19 UTC

Occipital Structure Sensor

    1. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(17%2520of%252024)

3D Scanning Comes to the iPad
       Launching on Kickstarter, Occipital's Structure Sensor can capture
       detailed 3D information about a space or object.
    2. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(1%2520of%252024)

iPad Bracket
       The sensor attaches to an iPad with a special bracket. The bracket
       can be removed for use with other devices.
    3. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(21%2520of%252024)

Data Capture
       The camera on the sensor is aligned with the iPad's, letting it
       capture texture information from an object.
    4. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(18%2520of%252024)

iPad Experience
       The sensor adds bulk to the tablet, but it takes 3D image capture
       to a new level.
    5. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(19%2520of%252024)

Lightning Connector
       The sensor connects via the iPad's Lightning port.
    6. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(15%2520of%252024)

Size
       It won't fit in a pocket, but the Structure Sensor is small enough
       to slip into a bag.
    7. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(11%2520of%252024)

Lightning Cable
       The cable is L-shaped for an easier fit. The other side is a
       proprietary connector.
    8. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(9%2520of%252024)

Ports
       The data port and power connector (for charging the battery) are on
       the bottom.
    9. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(22%2520of%252024)

With iPhone
       The Structure Sensor works with the iPhone, too.
   10. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(24%2520of%252024)

Imagery
       The 3D data is highly detailed.
   11. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(14%2520of%252024)

Scanning Hardware
       The Structure Sensor has a camera as well as infrared emitters and
       secondary sensors.
   12. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(3%2520of%252024)

Bracket Options
       The sensor comes off the bracket, and users can 3D-print brackets
       for other devices.
   13. Occipital%25203d%2520scanner%2520(10%2520of%252024)

Colors
       Occipital hasn't finalized the colors the sensor will come in. But
       we like these.

Profile View

   [48]3D printing is an incredible technology, although it requires
   detailed information about the objects you want to print. For most
   people, this is a big limitation -- it's not like every phone or tablet
   has a 3D imaging camera. Enter Occipital.

   The Structure Sensor is an oblong metal object that attaches to an
   [49]iPad with a special bracket. It works with apps specifically
   designed to use the sensor to scan and capture 3D information about an
   object or environment. You can use the sensor for a wide range of tasks
   -- from object capture to augmented-reality games.

   The sensor can quickly scan an object or room and gather distance and
   geometry information to create an accurate 3D rendering. Occipital, the
   company behind the sensor, said its device can "understand" the data it
   collects, letting users instantly call up wall dimensions, for example.
   It even makes use of the iPad's built-in camera.

   "Our camera is actually axially aligned with the built-in camera," said
   Jeff Powers, the founder of Occipital. "That's important because we're
   fusing the data from those two sensors. We're also fusing the gyro and
   accelerometer that's on board. In the iPad, you kind of have the rest
   of the story, but it was missing this active 3D sensing."

   The iPad has offered 3D image capture apps in the past, notably
   [51]Autodesk's 123D Catch, but Occipital said its specialized sensor is
   in a different league.

   "That stuff's awesome, but there are some limitations," Powers said.
   "One limitation is that if you're trying to capture geometry of
   something that doesn't have texture, like a table, you're going to have
   a hard time. When you have a structured light emitter -- when you have
   something that's actually putting projected texture onto things -- you
   can get perfect geometry."

   I got a little hands-on time with a prototype Structure Sensor in a
   private demo. It's a beautiful piece of technology, and the anodized
   aluminum exterior complements the iPad well. It certainly adds some
   bulk, but it slips on and off the iPad easily enough, and the corners
   ensure it stays stable.

   During the demo, I saw the sensor capture a 3D rendering of the room, a
   stuffed doll and my head. It did so quickly; in fact, it was a little
   eerie to look at a captured animation of my head that I could
   manipulate with my fingers (see below).

   Occipital 3D Scan

   Occipital is building the Structure Sensor as a platform and launching
   a campaign on [52]Kickstarter today to produce a first wave of sensors
   before the end of the year. Another wave of sensors is slated for early
   next year.

   The company says it plans to provide both high- and low-level APIs to
   satisfy 3D dabblers and experts.

   "As a developer using this device, this is the new thing you didn't
   have, a mobile 'depth stream,' essentially," Power said. "On top of
   that, we're building APIs that make it easy for developers who don't
   know anything about how to use the depth stream."

   Those who receive the [53]Kickstarter version of the sensor will also
   get a set of demo apps, including ones for scanning indoor spaces,
   capturing objects, gaming and even body scanning.

   Although the sensor is designed for use with the iPad, Occipital makes
   it easy to plug it into another device. Developers will have access to
   open-source drivers for Android and other platforms, and the device
   ships with both an Apple Lightning connector cable as well as a
   standard-USB one (however, other devices lose the texture-capturing
   advantage of axially aligned cameras). Developers can even 3D-print
   their own brackets.

   Occipital is paying special attention to developers because the company
   itself is one. It creates popular iOS apps such as [54]RedLaser (now
   owned by eBay) and [55]360 Panorama. The Structure Sensor is its first
   foray into hardware.

   "We're really passionate about 3D computer vision, and we wanted to do
   something harder, better and more intense in terms of an engineering
   challenge -- not just building one app after another," Powers said.

   Update: Occipital met its Kickstarter goal of $100,000 for the
   Structure Sensor in 3.5 hours.
