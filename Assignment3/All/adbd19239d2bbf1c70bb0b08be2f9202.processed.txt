   Shell scripts are widely used in the UNIX world. They're excellent for
   speeding up repetitive tasks and simplifying complex execution logic.
   They can be as simple as a set of commands, or they can orchestrate
   complex tasks. In this tutorial, we'll learn more about the Bash
   scripting language by writing an example script step-by-step.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Fizz-Buzz Problem

   One of the best way to learn about a new language is by example. Let's
   start with one.

   The Fizz-Buzz problem is a very simple one. It became famous after a
   programmer, named Imran, used it as an interview test. It turns out
   that 90-99.5% of the candidates for a programming job are simply unable
   to write the simplest program. Imran took this simple Fizz-Buzz game
   and asked the candidates to solve it. Many followed Imran's example,
   and, today, it is one of the most asked frequently asked questions for
   a programming job. If you're hiring, and need a way to filter through
   90% of the candidates, this is a great problem to present.

   Here are the rules:
     * Take and print the numbers between 1 and 100.
     * When a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
       number.
     * When it is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead.
     * When it is divisible both by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

   That's all there is to it. I'm sure most of you can already visualize
   the two or three if statements to solve this. Let's work through this
   using the Bash scripting language.
     __________________________________________________________________

Shebang

   A shebang refers to the combination of the hash and exclamation mark
   characters: #!. The program loader will look for a shebang on the first
   line of the script, and use the interpreter specified in it. A shebang
   consists of the following syntax: #!interpreter [parameters]. The
   interpreter is the program that is used to interpret our language. For
   bash scripting, that would be /bin/bash. For example, if you want to
   create a script in PHP and run it in console, you'd probably want to
   use /usr/bin/php (or the path to the PHP executable on your machine) as
   the interpreter.
#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
phpinfo();

   Yes, that will actually work! Isn't it simple? Just be sure to make
   your file executable first. Once you do, this script will output your
   PHP information as you would expect.

   Tip: To ensure that your script will work on as many systems as
   possible, you can use /bin/env in the shebang. As such, instead of
   /bin/bash, you could use /bin/env bash, which will work on systems
   where the bash executable is not within /bin.
     __________________________________________________________________

Outputting Text

   The output of a script will be equal to, as you might expect, whatever
   is outputted from your command. However, if we explicitly want to write
   something to the screen, we can use echo.
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello World"

   Running this script will print "Hello World" in the console.
csaba@csaba ~ $ ./helloWorld.sh
Hello World
csaba@csaba ~ $
     __________________________________________________________________

Introducing Variables

   As with any programming language, when writing shell scripts, you can
   use variables.
#!/bin/bash

message="Hello World"
echo $message

   This code produces exactly the same "Hello World" message. As you can
   see, to assign a value to a variable, simply write its name - exclude
   the dollar sign in front of it. Also, be careful with spaces; there
   can't be any spaces between the variable name and the equal sign. So
   message="Hello" instead of message = 'Hello'

   When you wish to use a variable, you can take the value from it just as
   we did in the echo command. Prepending a $ to the variable's name will
   return its value.

   Tip: Semicolons aren't required in bash scripting. You can use them in
   most cases, but be careful: they may have a different meaning than what
   you expect.
     __________________________________________________________________

Printing the Numbers Between 1 and 100

   Continuing on with our demo project, we need to cycle through all
   numbers between 1 and 100. For this, we'll need to use a for loop.
#!/bin/bash

for number in {1..100}; do
    echo $number
done

   There are several new things worth noting in this example - which by
   the way, prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, one number at a time.
     * The for syntax in Bash is: for VARIABLE in RANGE; do COMMAND done.
     * The curly braces will transform 1..100 into a range in our example.
       They're used in other contexts as well, which we'll review shortly.
     * do and for are actually two separate commands. If you want to place
       two commands on a single line, you'll need to separate them
       somehow. One way is to use semicolon. Alternatively you could write
       the code without a semicolon by moving do to the following line.

#!/bin/bash

for number in {1..100}
do
    echo $number
done
     __________________________________________________________________

The First Decision

   Now that we know how to print all the numbers between 1 and 100, it's
   time to make our first decision.
#!/bin/bash

for number in {1..100}; do
    if [ $((number%3)) -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Fizz"
    else
        echo $number
    fi
done

   This example will output "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3. Again, we
   have to deal with a bit of new syntax. Let's take them one by one.
     * if..then..else..fi - this is the classic syntax for an if statement
       in Bash. Of course, the else part is optional - but required for
       our logic in this case.
     * if COMMAND-RETURN-VALUE; then... - if will execute if the return
       value of the command is zero. Yes, logic in Bash is zero based,
       meaning that commands that execute successfully exit with a code of
       0. If something goes wrong, on the other hand, a positive integer
       will be returned. To simplify things: anything other than 0 is
       considered false.
     * Mathematical expressions in Bash are specified by double
       parentheses. $((number%3)) will return the remaining value of
       dividing the variable, number, by 3. Please note that we did not
       use $ inside the parenthesis - only in front of them.

   You might be wondering where the command is in our example. Isn't there
   just a bracket with an odd expression in it? Well, it turns out that [
   is actually an executable command. To play around with this, try out
   the following commands in your console.
csaba@csaba ~ $ which [
/usr/bin/[
csaba@csaba ~ $ [ 0 -eq 1 ]
csaba@csaba ~ $ echo $?
1
csaba@csaba ~ $ [ 0 -eq 0 ]
csaba@csaba ~ $ echo $?
0

     Tip: A command's exit value is always returned into the variable, ?
     (question mark). It is overwritten after each new command's
     execution.
     __________________________________________________________________

Checking for Buzz

   We're doing well so far. We have "Fizz"; now let's do the "Buzz" part.
#!/bin/bash

for number in {1..100}; do
    if [ $((number%3)) -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Fizz"
    elif [ $((number%5)) -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Buzz"
    else
        echo $number
    fi
done

   Above, we've introduced another condition for divisibility by 5: the
   elif statement. This, of course, translates to else if, and will be
   executed if the command following it returns true (or 0). As you can
   observe, the conditional statements within [] are usually evaluated
   with the help of parameters, such as -eq, which stands for "equals."

     For the syntax, arg1 OP arg2, OP is one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt,
     or -ge. These arithmetic binary operators return true if arg1 is
     equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater
     than, or greater than or equal to arg2, respectively.arg1 and arg2
     may be positive or negative integers. - Bash Manual

   When you're attempting to compare strings, you may use the well-known
   == sign, or even a single equal sign will do. != returns true when the
   strings are different.
     __________________________________________________________________

But the Code isn't Quite Correct

   So far, the code runs, but the logic is not correct. When the number is
   divisible by both 3 and 5, our logic will echo only "Fizz." Let's
   modify our Code to satisfy the last requirement of FizzBuzz.
#!/bin/bash

for number in {1..100}; do
    output=""
    if [ $((number%3)) -eq 0 ]; then
        output="Fizz"
    fi
    if [ $((number%5)) -eq 0 ]; then
        output="${output}Buzz"
    fi
    if [ -z $output ]; then
        echo $number
    else
        echo $output;
    fi
done

   Again, we've had to make a handful of changes. The most notable one is
   the introduction of a variable, and then the concatenation of "Buzz" to
   it, if necessary. Strings in bash are typically defined between double
   quotes ("). Single quotes are usable as well, but for easier
   concatenation, doubles are the better choice. Within these double
   quotes, you can reference variables: some text $variable some other
   text" will replace $variable with its contents. When you want to
   concatenate variables with strings without spaces between them, you may
   prefer to put the variable's name within curly braces. In most cases,
   like PHP, you're not required to do so, but it helps a lot when it
   comes to the code's readability.

   Tip: You can't compare empty strings. That would return a missing
   parameter.

   Because arguments inside [ ] are treated as parameters, for "[", they
   must be different from an empty string. So this expression, even though
   logical, will output an error: [ $output != "" ]. That's why we've used
   [ -z $output ], which returns true if the string has a length of zero.
     __________________________________________________________________

Extract Method for Logical Expression

   One way to improve our example is to extract into functions the
   mathematical expression from the if statements, like so:
#!/bin/bash

function isDivisibleBy {
    return $(($1%$2))
}

for number in {1..100}; do
    output=""
    if isDivisibleBy $number 3; then
        output="Fizz"
    fi
    if isDivisibleBy $number 5; then
        output="${output}Buzz"
    fi
    if [ -z $output ]; then
        echo $number
    else
        echo $output;
    fi
done

   We took the expressions comparing the rest with zero, and moved them
   into a function. Even more, we eliminated the comparison with zero,
   because zero means true for us. We only have to return the value from
   the mathematical expression - very simple!

   Tip: A function's definition must precede its call.

   In Bash, you can define a method as function func_name { commands; }.
   Optionally, there is a second syntax for declaring functions: func_name
   () { commands; }. So, we can drop the string, function and add "()"
   after its name. I personally prefer this option, as exemplified in the
   example above. It's more explicit and resembles traditional programming
   languages.

   You do not need to specify the parameters for a function in Bash.
   Sending parameters to a function is accomplished by simply enumerating
   over them after the function call separated by white spaces. Do not
   place commas or parenthesis in the function call - it won't work.

   Received parameters are automatically assigned to variables by number.
   The first parameter goes to $1, the second to $2, and so on. The
   special variable, $0 refers the current script's file name.

Let's Play with Parameters

#!/bin/bash

function exampleFunc {
    echo $1
    echo $0
    IFS="X"
    echo "$@"
    echo "$*"
}

exampleFunc "one" "two" "three"

   This code will produce the following output:
csaba@csaba ~ $ ./parametersExamples.sh
one
./parametersExamples.sh
one two thre
oneXtwoXthre

   Let's analyze the source, line by line.
     * The last line is the function call. We call it with three string
       parameters.
     * The first line after the shebang is the function definition.
     * The first line in the function outputs the first parameter: "one".
       So far so simple.
     * The second line outputs current script's file name. Again, very
       simple.
     * The third line changes the default character separator to the
       letter, "X". By default, this is " " (a space). That's how Bash
       knows how the parameters are separated.
     * The fourth line outputs a special variable, $@. It represents all
       the parameters as a single word, exactly as specified in the
       function call.
     * The final line outputs another special variable, $*. It represents
       all the parameters, taken one-by-one and concatenated with the
       first letter of the IFS variable. That's why the result is
       oneXtwoXthre.
     __________________________________________________________________

Returning Strings From Functions

   As I noted earlier, functions in Bash can return only integers. As
   such, writing return "a string" would be invalid code. Still, in many
   situations, you need more than just a zero or one. We can refactor our
   FizzBuzz example so that, in the for statement, we will just make a
   function call.
#!/bin/bash

function isDivisibleBy {
    return $(($1%$2))
}

function fizzOrBuzz {
    output=""
    if isDivisibleBy $1 3; then
        output="Fizz"
    fi
    if isDivisibleBy $1 5; then
        output="${output}Buzz"
    fi
    if [ -z $output ]; then
        echo $1
    else
        echo $output;
    fi
}

for number in {1..100}; do
    fizzOrBuzz $number
done

   Well, this is the first step. We just extracted all the code into a
   function, called fizzOrBuzz, and then replaced $number with $1.
   However, all outputting occurs in the fizzOrBuzz function. We want to
   output from the for loop with an echo statement, so that we can prepend
   each line with another string. We have to capture the fizzOrBuzz
   function's output.
#[...]
for number in {1..100}; do
    echo "-`fizzOrBuzz $number`"
    fizzBuzzer=$(fizzOrBuzz $number)
    echo "-${fizzBuzzer}"
done

   We've updated our for loop just a bit (no other changes). We've now
   echoed everything twice in two different ways to exemplify the
   differences between the two solutions to the same problem.

   The first solution to capture the output of a function or another
   command is to use backticks. In 99% of the cases, this will work just
   fine. You can simply reference a variable within backticks by their
   names, as we did with $number. The first few lines of the output should
   now look like:
csaba@csaba ~/Personal/Programming/NetTuts/The Basics of BASH Scripting/Sources
$ ./fizzBuzz.sh
-1
-1
-2
-2
-Fizz
-Fizz
-4
-4
-Buzz
-Buzz
-Fizz
-Fizz
-7
-7

   As you can see, everything is duplicated. Same output.

   For the second solution, we've chosen to first assign the return value
   to a variable. In that assignment, we used $(), which, in this case,
   forks the script, executes the code, and returns its output.
     __________________________________________________________________

;, && and ||

   Do you remember that we used semicolon here and there? They can be used
   to execute several commands written on the same line. If you separate
   them by semicolons, they will just simply be executed.

   A more sophisticated case is to use && between two commands. Yes,
   that's a logical AND; it means that the second command will be executed
   only if the first one returns true (it exits with 0). This is helpful;
   we can simplify the if statements into these shorthands:
#!/bin/bash

function isDivisibleBy {
    return $(($1%$2))
}

function fizzOrBuzz {
    output=""
    isDivisibleBy $1 3 && output="Fizz"
    isDivisibleBy $1 5 && output="${output}Buzz"
    if [ -z $output ]; then
        echo $1
    else
        echo $output;
    fi
}

for number in {1..100}; do
    echo "-`fizzOrBuzz $number`"
done

   As our function, isDivisibleBy returns a proper return value, we can
   then use && to set the variable we want. What's after && will be
   executed only if the condition is true. In the same manner, we can use
   || (double pipe character) as a logical OR. Here's a quick example
   below.
csaba@csaba ~ $ echo "bubu" || echo "bibi"
bubu
csaba@csaba ~ $ echo false || echo "bibi"
false
csaba@csaba ~ $

     Because arguments inside [ ] are treated as parameters, for "[",
     they must be different from an empty string. So this expression,
     even though logical, will output an error: [ $output != "" ]. That's
     why we've used [ -z $output ], which returns true if the string has
     a length of zero.
       Can you elaborate on this? $output isn't a string inside the " [ "?

       Try to forget the concept of "empty string" for a moment and think
       in "replace with" way. So, if we have [ $val == "something" ] and
       than we have val="somethingElse" that would expand into [
       "somethingElse" == "something" ] which would fail, correctly.
       However when you have an empty string is like you have nothing. So
       it would expand into [ == "something" ] which is a syntax error.
       Maybe you could trick it with some enforced extra quoting, but the
       more elegant and recommended way is to use to built-in modifiers
       like -z for zero-length-string or -f for file-exists and so on.

   Thank you for the great tutorial! Is there a reason why the last if
   statement is not eliminated as well in function fizzOrBuzz like so:

   function fizzOrBuzz {
   output=""
   isDivisibleBy $1 3 && output="Fizz"
   isDivisibleBy $1 5 && output="${output}Buzz"
   [ -z $output ] && output=$1
   echo $output
   }

       There is no technical reason. I just thought I leave it in because
       it is cleaner that way. Your suggestion would be perfect in a real
       application for persons used with BASH and it's syntax.

       That is obviously a typo there. I meant three. But it can be

   Really nice - I would like to read some bash magic and dealing with
   file name with spaces, " and `. I know the basics, but when i have to
   pass a file name through some commands, and file name has spaces, it
   gets really funky sometimes :)
   Great tutorial :)

   awesome intro to bash for those familiar with basics of programming.
   Thanks!
