[4]Staying sharp requires "intellectual gardening"

   Gardening requires consistency. A beautiful garden is unstable. Some
   plants want to expand their reach and kill out the competition. Some
   plants are simply out of their element and need a little bit of help.
   Generally, there is too much competition for water, sunshine and
   minerals. So the gardener must, from time to time, intervene to move
   plants around, dig some out, or plant new ones. Sometimes extra
   watering is needed.

   For years, I try to make my garden as self-sufficient as possible. A
   strategy that I have pursued is to try many things and let them fail.
   For example, when I plant something, I do not try to keep it alive with
   artificial watering or nutrients. This has served me well as I have
   found some very robust perennials that are ideally suited to my garden
   (like hardy geraniums).

   Nevertheless, if I neglect a piece of my garden for too long, it goes
   out of balance. For example, some plants start dying out, leaving
   nothing interesting in their place.

   My garden is also limited. Over the years, I have slightly grown my
   garden but its rate of growth has diminished for fear that I would be
   overburdened with maintenance.

   I view my mind in a similar manner. There are a few things that I am
   good at. For example, I am a decent programmer using a few mainstream
   languages. I can do probabilistic modelling and some algorithm design.
   However, my skills get rusty if I stop using them.

   To stay sharp, I have found that I need to constantly "train". Hence,
   by design, I try to use a little bit of Java and C++ every few months
   even though my job does not require it. Similarly, I try to keep on
   proving mathematical results when I get a chance.

   But because time is limited, I cannot stay sharp with everything. For
   example, I am a database researcher and I teach database courses. I
   know the SQL syntax. However, anyone using SQL for a living can easily
   outgun me in SQL. Once a year, I have to look up how to do an
   intersection in MySQL for example.

   And even with the skills that I regularly need, I limit the scope of my
   knowledge. For example, I was unaware until a few days ago of Java's
   [5]Double Brace Initialization idiom. Far from being embarrassed by my
   shortcoming, I view it as necessary. If I chose to know everything
   there is to know about Java, I'd have to restrict my scope more than I
   like. (Consider that Java is much more complex than Chess and, yet,
   people devote their lives to studying Chess.)

   Following my gardening analogy, I have pursued two strategies to stay
   sharp:
     * Be deliberate about what I know. Within even the smallest
       subdomain, there is more to know than my brain can swallow. In some
       sense, I am defined by what I know and that's something I like to
       have control over.
     * I purposefully "train". For example, I will find excuses to apply
       certain skills at regular intervals.

   Does it work? Not as well as I'd like. I feel tremendous tension
   between what I should know and how well I should know it. Still, I find
   that gardening analogy useful. Whenever I feel like I have covered too
   much ground, I think back about my garden. It is not the ground you
   cover that that defines a beautiful garden.

    1. You should almost always do intersection through a join.

    2. Given the state of my backyard, likely I should be wary of
       gardening analogies.
       In a similar vein, I find that my expertise tends to be episodic. I
       learned SQL and relational database usage quite well back in the
       mid-80s, yet there are times when I do no work in that area for
       years. The same can be said for GUI, Java, Perl or C++ programming,
       at one time or another. Starting a new episode requires much use of
       reference materials, at first, but the once-familiar topic comes
       back quickly.
       Maybe gardening is a good analogy, as something once very familiar,
       if currently disused. :)
       To be effective, you have to let at least some disused skills rust,
       to allow focus on used skills.

    3. I had the opportunity to work with a real c++ guru a while back.
       His code had approachability issues (you had to be at least
       familiar with everything C++ has to offer), but once you got past
       that his solutions were invariably straightforward, generalizable
       and robust. He could make that language dance.
       I'm at another extreme, with endless interests. I'm never able to
       focus long enough on a single topic to reach the very top echelons
       of it. But that wide breadth of knowledge has served me well. I can
       program. I can write. I can do complicated math. I can pull
       inspiration from nature, from the mind, from quantum physics, from
       whatever. I find I can approach arbitrary problems for more
       directions than most.
       Ultimately, the world needs gardens devoted to a few of the best
       flowers, wide overflowing, haphazardly cultivated gardens and
       everything in between.
