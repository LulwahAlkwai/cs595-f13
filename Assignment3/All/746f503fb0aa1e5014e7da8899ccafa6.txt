				<p>Your microphone doesn&#8217;t only hear your voice. It also hears your <em>room.</em></p>
<p>Few things annoy me more, when listening to a podcast, voiceover, or vocal track, than a crappy-sounding room. You can&#8217;t fix a lousy room sound in the mix! That&#8217;s why professional studios usually have a vocal booth or isolation booth of some sort. It&#8217;s a room that is lined with sound-absorbing materials. A vocal booth could be anything from a closet lined with packing blankets to <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/2008/10/07/touring-electrical-audio/#alcatraz">an engineered space that acts like a sonic black hole</a>. </p>
<p>Low-cost methods can work. But, needless to say, you need a space first. Sometimes circumstances just don&#8217;t allow for a booth.</p>
<p>Or do they? I wonder if you&#8217;ve <strong>overlooked an excellent vocal booth that you already own</strong>?<span id="more-5741"></span></p>
<h3>Audio Test &#8211; The Mystery Vocal Booth</h3>
<p>I recorded a quick voice track using an inexpensive condenser, the <a title="Studio Projects LSM" href="http://recordinghacks.com/microphones/Studio-Projects/LSM"><img width=150 src="http://cdn.recordinghacks.com/images/mics/00950/00950_150.jpg" alt="Studio Projects LSM" class="thumb shaft" />Studio Projects LSM</a>. Although the LSM has a 16-bit USB output, I used its analog output and a Mackie Onyx Blackjack 24-bit USB interface. </p>
<p>The first track below was recorded in my studio room, which is fairly well treated with RealTraps and Auralex absorption products. It doesn&#8217;t sound bad at all; in fact, all the podcasts I&#8217;ve guested on were recorded right here, as well as all my podcast mic shootouts [the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/2011/06/02/ultimate-podcast-mic-shootout/">Ultimate Podcasting Mic Shootout</a> of broadcast dynamics, the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/2011/12/22/best-200-podcasting-condenser-mics/">$200 Condensers</a> shootout, and the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/2013/02/20/usb-dynamic-mic-shootout/">USB Dynamics</a> shootout].</p>

<p>&#8230; but then, this track does benefit from ~$2500 worth of acoustic treatment. It <em>ought</em> to sound pretty good. If you heard that track by itself, you might not notice the sound of the room at all.</p>
<p>Well, until you hear the same voice, the same mic, and the same interface, recorded inside my mystery vocal booth. Check out how dry and direct this sounds:</p>

<p>This track is so much more present, more detailed, and more clear! It sounds louder, but it&#8217;s not; all the tracks on this page were RMS gain-matched. </p>
<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t need so much control over your room sound, but if ever you do, I&#8217;ll show you how to get it. </p>
<p>But first, I&#8217;m going to be a bit unfair.</p>
<h3>Audio Torture Test &#8211; The Flutter Echo Room</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s pretend your recording space is <em>not</em> well treated. (Judging from some of the voiceovers and podcasts I&#8217;ve heard, too many are not!) </p>
<p>I recorded a track in the worst-sounding room in my house. It&#8217;s a 16&#39;x14&#39; space with a hard floor, a giant window, and apparently not enough furnishings to tame its reverb. It suffers from <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/2011/06/04/flutter-echo/">gruesome flutter echo</a> (click that link to hear flutter echo slowed down to half-speed, which is the sonic equivalent of watching someone get knifed in slow motion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<script type='text/javascript'>_wpaudio.enc['wpaudio-524fcbf18df7d'] = '\u0068\u0074\u0074\u0070\u003a\u002f\u002f\u0063\u0064\u006e\u002e\u0072\u0065\u0063\u006f\u0072\u0064\u0069\u006e\u0067\u0068\u0061\u0063\u006b\u0073\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d\u002f\u0073\u006f\u0075\u006e\u0064\u0073\u002f\u0073\u0061\u006d\u0070\u006c\u0065\u0073\u002f\u0063\u0061\u0072\u0062\u006f\u006f\u0074\u0068\u002f\u0076\u006f\u0069\u0063\u0065\u005f\u0066\u006c\u0075\u0074\u0074\u0065\u0072\u002e\u006d\u0070\u0033';</script><a id='wpaudio-524fcbf18df7d' class='wpaudio wpaudio-nodl wpaudio-enc' href='#'>Voice track, echo room</a></p>
<p>I can hear the sound of the space clearly through monitors, but for best effect, listen through headphones. Then compare it to the two previous tracks. This illustrates the value of a dead space (or, at least, a controlled space) clearly.</p>
<h3>Your Mystery Vocal Booth, Revealed</h3>
<p>It is a small space, lined approximately 60% with sound-absorbent foam and fabric. It has no parallel surfaces that could set up standing waves. And it is shockmounted from the floor, to prevent capture of mechanical vibrations.</p>
<p>Is that description not ringing any bells? I&#8217;ll give you the final clue: <em>it&#8217;s parked in your driveway.</em></p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m talking about your car. Hardtop and cloth seats preferred, and a garage too. It probably sounds better than your room does.</p>
<h3>Convenience &#038; Alternatives</h3>
<p>Recording in your car is not always convenient, I admit. You probably can&#8217;t stand in there, and there&#8217;s probably no room for instruments. There are a limited number of applications for which a vehicle makes a perfect isolation/vocal booth. </p>
<p>But, when you need that degree of isolation and control, you have it.</p>
<p>I would still recommend treating your room. This pays for itself in the quality of your recorded tracks, as well as the translation of your mixes. There&#8217;s really no substitute for a great-sounding room.</p>
<p>As an inexpensive first step toward treating your room, I&#8217;d recommend the <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/2010/03/21/realtraps-pvb-review/">RealTraps Portable Vocal Booth</a>. It puts a healthy dose of absorption immediately behind your vocal mic, giving you a significant improvement in control for a relatively low cost &#8212; certainly much cheaper than treating the whole room.</p>
<p>I also tend to recommend dynamic mics for most voice applications. Unless you have a trained voice, you&#8217;ll probably get better results with a dynamic microphone. (If you&#8217;re shopping, Audio-Technica has a crazy-inexpensive option in its <a href="http://recordinghacks.com/2013/03/13/atr2100-usb-and-at2005usb-a-closer-look/">~$49 ATR2100-USB</a>.) </p>
<h3>It&#8217;s dumb, but it works.</h3>
<p>Some of you are probably tempted to write comments to tell me what a remarkably stupid idea it is to suggest recording voice tracks in a car. </p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t deny the effect. </p>
<p>If you take just one thing away from this article, let it be this: <strong>Listen to your room. And then fix it.</strong></p>

				<p>Although I agree on your recordings, I do not have a similar results.</p>
<p>I have a small car and its quite the opposite. Its by no means as reverberant as some rooms but it is very boxy and rather horrible sounding. It sounds as if I&#8217;m trapped in a closet, you know its dampened by the clothes (or carseats/carpet) but there is still a sense of &#8220;small roomy&#8221; sound.</p>
<p>If I need a quick DIY booth I go for the much more cooler &#8220;building a fort out of bedsheets and pillows&#8221; method.</p>
<p>P.S. My garage is solid concrete all over&#8230;</p>

				<p>@christopher, kudos to you for trying it, and for listening! </p>
<p>The last time I built a fort out of bedsheets was a disaster. I was on the road, with no mic stands. I ended up squatting next to the bed, holding the comforter over my head with one arm and the mic with another. It sounded OK, but I would have had an easier time in the car.</p>

				<p>I recommend recording in cars all the time when I am mixing a movie that needs an ADR line, especially off-camera. I simply ask the actor to record a handful of takes at different intensities with their iPhone, or a Zoom. The back seat usually is better because you avoid the front windshield reflections. </p>
<p>Also &#8211; when I&#8217;ve helped friends with their podcasts, I notice most people use a desk stand, which puts the mic only a few inches above the table surface. This causes severe comb filtering right in the midrange frequencies. Simply raising the mic up with a taller stand, or putting a paint can under the mic stand works well. An alternative is to place a thick fabric, like bunched up fleece or a bunched up sweatshirt on the table in front of the mic. Even cutting two peaks from a 1-foot wide piece of Auralex and placing that on the table a few inches in front of the mic kills the comb filter causing reflections.</p>
<p>Play around and see how much better things can sound!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve mused on the sonic benefits of the automobile many times myself. Not only in the regard you&#8217;re speaking of, but also in terms of the ubiquitous &#8220;why does my voice always sound so much better when I&#8217;m signing in my car?&#8221; comment. </p>
<p>Obviously there are lots of other mitigating circumstances to be considered (you&#8217;re singing over someone else&#8217;s vocal track, you&#8217;re not singing into a dynamically-sensitive mic, your skull resonates pleasingly, etc) but there&#8217;s no doubt that all of those sonic benefits that Matt mentioned are in play as well.</p>
<p>And any engineer who&#8217;s been at it a while will tell you that a properly-mixed album&#8217;s not done until it &#8220;passes the car test.&#8221; Ostensibly this is an exercise in how well your mix holds up in a less-than-ideal environment, but I would argue that it&#8217;s a pretty great one. Road/engine noise and less-than ideal speaker choices (and car doors as speaker cabinets) make this statement far less than totally accurate, but it&#8217;s still a really essential test of an album&#8217;s polish.</p>

				<p>Awesome tests! I&#8217;ve been playing with a portable booth but find it difficult to use when recording a podcast because I need access to my screen / notes. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m at the point though of creating a dedicated room because here in Sweden our houses are all wooden floors and massive glass windows. The room noise drives me crazy.</p>

				<p>Jon, if a dedicated room is too big a stretch, you could drape heavy blankets over boom stands (with the arm at 90 degrees to the base), creating lightweight gobos, during recording. </p>
<p>I can definitely hear the room in your voice tracks. </p>
<p>It is good to see that you have some decent microphones to work with:<br />

<p>As Adam Kagan suggested in a previous comment, reducing reflections in the immediate vicinity of the microphone could help, too. Make sure to angle the mic so that your computer screen is in the mic&#8217;s null point.</p>
<p>Note too that the PR40&#8217;s null is _not_ at 180 degrees; that mic is essentially hypercardioid, with the deepest null at 135 degrees:<br />

				<p>I have used my walk-in closet packed on 3 walls with hanging clothes. It is more like an anechoic chamber than a treated room, but with careful use of a convolution reverb it does well.</p>

				<p>Somehow, I intuitively knew recording in the car would work out. Must have been all those car commercials about the quiet ride. Besides, it was either that, or a highly reflective room with wood floors, bare walls, and mic mounted on a wooden desk top.</p>
<p>Bottom line. I hopped in the back seat of a late model Volkswagen Jetta, used the drop down arm rest, and spoke into the built-in mics of a Zoom H4n for the voice over that was due to my client overnight. &#8212; Mission Accomplished.  </p>
<p>Sure, I know I what I used, and was equally shocked when the client LOVED the piece. (Of course, I did also use a music bed below it, but that was as requested).</p>
<p>Great article. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Here is a new product I discovered that will solve many of your room problems easily and not cost a fortune. My room was the dreaded rectangle, four paralell walls and eight foot ceilings. Not only did I have flutter, the low end built up as well. I bought one package of these down sloping panels and turned my room into a nice smooth sounding space.<br />
I really didnt expect the low end to be tamed as well as it was.<br />
This is worth checking out. I got mine at just under $600.00 from a new<br />
dealer.<br />

				<p>Whenever I have to rig up a recording booth out of nothing I&#8217;ll raise a few beds  up vertically. Ideally four as to build a room within the room. It is then possible to lay a mattress on top and even underneath. Usually works quite well.<br />
Thanks for good article and all the useful tips in this thread!</p>

				<p>I produce a weekly radio program for public radio stations (NOT a podcast), usually recorded in a friend&#8217;s dining room, or other random location since they lost their home and studio. We have settled on using earclip mics, such as the ones from microphonemadness.com or PylePro. Since they are located right by the mouth, they can sound very good.</p>
<p>We also use a 10 band narrow notch filter (Waves Q10) to reduce room resonances with narrow filters around a Q of 100 and it cleans it up nicely!</p>
<p>The ear mics allow far more flexibility and clarity, and the ones around $129 and even the $25 Pyles actually work very well.</p>
<p>Another good tip is the Auralex type foam which can be glued to pegboard material from any hardware store and hung on small nails or mic stands wherever you need them.</p>

				<p>Brilliant&#8230; low tech and some common sense often win the war against evil audio conundrums!  The industry would like to throw money at it, we don&#8217;t all have that 5+ figure budget.  It&#8217;s most enjoyable when someone comes up with a basic and simple solution!  Yes, choice of cars / interiors would be crucial.  Wouldn&#8217;t be hard to look through old road tests in Car and Driver or Road and Track to find those buggies that have the quietest interiors.  Though you might be a redneck if you use vehicle seats for your sitting room, they do absorb a tremendous amount of audio with their thick foam and durable upholstery , may be a good addition to the studio, pretty comfortable too on long trips&#8230;  could headliners be cut to make absorptive panels, you may have started something!</p>

				<p>Yes, I was thinking of this the other day when I was singing in my car.  It&#8217;s soooo dead in there&#8230;now all I need to do is clean my truck</p>
