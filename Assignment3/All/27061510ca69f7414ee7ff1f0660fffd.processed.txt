   The maker movement is moving along full throttle, with things like
   [84]Maker Faire Rome (European Edition) coming up, posters that say
   things like "Make Something Today" popping up literally everywhere I
   turn around (at least in Toronto), and companies that could be
   considered the "fathers" of the maker movement (e.g. Arduino, MakerBot,
   Atmel -- the makers of the chips on Arduinos, etc.) making big waves in
   the media and the marketplace, creating new industry and disruption. It
   seems to me like making is taking over the world -- and beyond. I
   recently found out about a number of awesome projects that makers have
   created for space, such as 3D printers for space (by friends of mine
   with a company called [85]Made in Space).

   A great recent example of this is Atmel coming together with
   [86]ArduLab to create the world's first true open source platform for
   making space experiments, enabling anyone to send objects/experiments
   to space and then get data and video from the journey for under $5K.
   Applications of this technology include things like sending a plant
   into space to see how it grows, fun/silly things like sending
   engagement rings to space and back or making music videos of stuff in
   space, and sending a 3D printer to how it performs in zero gravity.
   They're working on the ability for users to control objects like this
   remotely and see them in real-time from the ground. Since the platform
   is controlled by Atmel's popular ATmega2560 microcontroller, it can be
   programmed just like an Arduino. In fact, using Atmel chips is one of a
   number of similarities between Ardulab and Made in Space -- another is
   that fellow alumni of NASA's Singularity University run both.

   ArduLab is doing their first launch on September 17, launching both
   their startup and their first experiment into space on the same day.
   ArduLab cofounder Manu Sharmas says, "We just have been notified that
   we are `go' on a launch slot for an ArduLab to the International Space
   Station in a commercial spacecraft (the Antares Rocket/Cygnus
   spacecraft developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation). After Cygnus
   spacecraft docks with ISS, astronauts will unload the payload including
   the ArduLab and install it inside a rack that is connected to a
   computer. It will perform experiments and test new technologies
   currently in development." I was lucky enough to have the opportunity
   to have my name engraved into the first launch object -- so although I
   won't be going to space (yet!), my name will (see photo above).

   This launch will be a big milestone for the maker movement, and usage
   of ArduLab will be very accessible to your everyday maker. Manu says,
   "With the help of Atmel, we have been able to launch space programs
   that are full package that includes nuts and bolts to ArduLab and a
   launch to space on a suborbital vehicle. With under $5K, any high
   school or university can transform their classroom into a space lab
   with all the students involved in designing and building projects,
   which later will be launched to space." With the new functionality they
   are creating, "educational institutions can create curriculum around
   running real space experiments and every single student or researcher
   can personally run an experiment aboard the ISS and interact with
   ArduLab in near real time."

   There are and will be hundreds, thousands, and maybe millions of
   Hewlett Packards and Steve Wosniaks -- although they strived to get PCs
   and computing into the personal home, now makers are striving for the
   far reaches of space and research and everything in between. With the
   passion and love of creating that makers have, there is a bigger
   intellectual and human-spirited movement happening where people are
   doing things that they love and that have great meaning. The skills
   that people are learning through participating in the maker movement
   (e.g. 3D printing, programming an Arduino, or building an R/C
   quadcopter) are translating into projects with a huge positive impact
   on the world. Innovation cycles are being shortened, startups are being
   born, and the Internet of Things is alive and well. To maker infinity,
   and beyond!
