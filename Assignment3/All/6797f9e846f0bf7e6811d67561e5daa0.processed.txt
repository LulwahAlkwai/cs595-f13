[71]The Quantum Zeno Effect actually does stop the world

   [ku-bigpic.jpg]

   Zeno of Elea was a Greek philosopher who suggested that if you could
   slice time into small enough increments, the world would freeze in
   place. It turns out that he was right -- at least, from a quantum
   mechanics perspective.

   University of Texas physicists George Sudarshan and Baidyanath Misra
   offer evidence of the Zeno Effect by showing that you can stop an atom
   from decaying, if you just check on it enough.

   Zeno of Elea was a philosopher who went around southern Italy
   two-and-a-half thousand years ago proving that nothing was true. He did
   this by setting up a series of paradoxes that showed, among other
   things, that half a given span of time is equal to twice that given
   span of time, that time and space are neither continuous nor discrete,
   and that nothing ever moves. Ever. With this last one, he was able to
   anticipate quantum mechanics by over two millennia. It was only in 1977
   that science caught on.

   The official name for the modern scientific theory is the Quantum Zeno
   Effect, and it's based on the Arrow Paradox. An arrow flies through the
   air. It flies in a series of instants. An instant is defined as the
   shortest moment of time possible. In any given instant, the arrow has
   to appear motionless. If it wasn't motionless, there would be two
   instants, one in which the arrow was at one position and one in which
   the arrow was in another position. This presents a problem. There is no
   other way to define an instant, but if time is made up of a number of
   instants, and the arrow doesn't move in any of them, the arrow can't
   move through the air at all.

   From Everyday Movement to Quantum Movement

   This idea of shrinking down the measurement of motion to the point at
   which it can never move struck a chord with two researchers at the
   University of Texas. George Sudarshan and Baidyanath Misra realized
   that the behavior of some decaying atoms could be manipulated by a
   version of the Arrow Paradox. An unwatched atom that has the potential
   to decay eventually slips, from our point of view, into a superposition
   of states. It is both decayed and not decayed until someone checks on
   it. When they do, it slips into one of those states. Checking on it
   isn't a coin flip. There isn't always a straight fifty-fifty chance of
   the atom having decayed. At some points in time, very soon after it has
   slipped into this superposition of states, it is more likely to not be
   decayed when someone checks on it. At others, it more likely to be
   decayed.

   Let's say an atom is very likely to have decayed after three seconds,
   but very unlikely to have decayed after one. Check on it after three
   seconds, and it probably will have decayed. But, Misra and Sudarshan
   argue, check on it three times in one second intervals, and it will
   most likely not have decayed. Every time you check on it, it will
   revert to its "original" measured state, and the clock will start over.
   Amazingly, this [72]actually does happen. Researchers observing sodium
   atoms observed that, "Depending on the frequency of measurements we
   observe a decay that is suppressed or enhanced as compared to the
   unperturbed system." The "enhanced" decay is the result of the Quantum
   Anti-Zeno Effect. Time your measurements just right and you can
   actually push a system to decay faster than it would if it were
   unobserved. Zeno was correct. It is possible to freeze the world, if
   you manage to measure it just right. It's just also possible to hurry
   it along.
