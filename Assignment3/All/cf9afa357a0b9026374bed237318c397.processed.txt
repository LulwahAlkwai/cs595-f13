[4]Are 8-bit or 16-bit counters faster than 32-bit counters?

   Programmers often want to count things. They typically use 32-bit
   counters (e.g., the int type in Java).

   But what if you are counting small numbers? Maybe a 16-bit counter
   could be enough (e.g., the short type in Java). Obviously, using fewer
   bits saves memory. Saving memory often makes programs run faster.

   However, something evil could also happen. Maybe compilers or CPUs are
   optimized for 32-bit arithmetic?

   I designed a small experiment. I build an array of counters. I
   repeatedly increment some of the counters. I then run through the array
   seeking counter values that exceed some threshold. [5]My code is freely
   available.

   One parameter is the size of the array. I expect that for tiny numbers
   of counters, the number of bits will be irrelevant: all of the counters
   can fit in CPU cache.

   Another parameter is the language. Does Java behave differently from
   C++? You would hope not, but C++ compilers can pull tricks that Java
   can't, and vice versa.

   I ran my tests on a recent Intel Core i7 processor. I was surprised to
   find that the Java and C++ speeds were almost the same:
    Number of counters   8 bits   16 bits   32 bits   64 bits
   2^16                 94       94        94        94
   2^23                 44       28        22        22

   As expected, when there are few counters, it does not matter how many
   bits you use. However, when the number of counters becomes large, using
   8-bit counters instead of 32-bit counters can double the speed.

   Conclusion: When you have many, it could be worth your time to
   benchmark an alternative using 8-bit or 16-bit counters.

    1. I'd revise the conclusion a bit: Keep your working set inside the
       caches. This has nothing to do with counting, for performance
       purposes you're just touching RAM.
