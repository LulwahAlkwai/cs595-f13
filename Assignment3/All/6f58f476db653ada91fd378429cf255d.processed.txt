   Oh Quark: Intel Just Changed the Technology Market #intel #idf2013
   At Intel's Developer Forum, Intel showcased a new System on a Chip
   product code named Quark which should put sensors and low powered
   capabilities in almost everything you touch. It could have significant
   impact on energy efficiency (allowing more targeted heating and
   cooling), allow furniture to better adjust to your growing posterior,
   and go a long way towards making the things around you smarter and
   better able to confirm to your needs rather than you having to conform
   to theirs. The market potential for this is massive as is the potential
   to significantly change the world around us. That the focus of my
   TechNewsWorld column this week:
