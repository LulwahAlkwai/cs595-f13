   Intel's Quarky Future: Prepare Your Inner Geek To Be Amazed!
   This is one of the first times in history that I think what Intel
   announced is far more interesting than what Apple announced at the same
   time. Intel basically announced a technology that will change how
   technology, and things that aren't now smart, will evolve in the future
   to make us happier. Yes unlike most technology vendors who generally
   announce things we have to learn or alter our behavior to use, Intel
   announced a technology that will allow technology to alter to better
   please us. Finally we can anticipate a future where we aren't slaves to
   the technology we buy and it, in turn, serves us. Granted it was with
   some concern I saw the word Robopocolipse on Brian David Johnson's
   (nick name Crystal Balls) slide deck suggesting technology may
   eventually fight back. With the exception of that last bit, the full
   story is in my weekly TGDaily column:
