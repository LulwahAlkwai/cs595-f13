The Web's longest nightmare ends: Eolas' patents are dead on appeal

Web pioneers united to stop "interactive web" patents at an East Texas trial.

   The Eolas patents were uniquely threatening to the Web and drew Tim
   Berners-Lee's personal attention.

   The inventor of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, had never testified in court
   before last year. In February 2012, he left Cambridge to fly down to
   Tyler, an East Texas city of about 100,000, to [11]testify at a patent
   trial. It was the culmination of a bold campaign by a man named Michael
   Doyle to levy a vast patent tax on the modern web.

   Berners-Lee was one of several web pioneers who came through the court
   during the course of a four-day trial, which ultimately convinced a
   jury to invalidate two patents owned by Eolas, the tiny patent-holding
   company that Doyle and his lawyers transformed into one of the most
   fearsome "patent trolls" of all time.

   Now Eolas appears to be gone for good. The company mounted a lengthy
   appeal, but it was all for naught; this morning, a three-judge appeals
   panel [12]affirmed the jury's verdict without comment.

   In 1993, Doyle was the director of a computer lab at the University of
   California-San Francisco. He oversaw the creation of a program that
   allowed doctors to view embryos online, and later claimed it was the
   first "interactive" use of the World Wide Web. University lawyers
   helped Doyle patent the creation in 1994.

   Doyle took the patent and created a company he called "Eolas," the
   Irish word for knowledge. Eolas never made a marketable product, but it
   ultimately launched a patent war that made Doyle a rich man. In 1999,
   he filed a lawsuit saying that Microsoft's Internet Explorer violated
   his patent on "interactive" features on the web; the suit resulted in a
   $540 million jury verdict. Appeals ensued but were inconclusive; the
   case [13]ultimately settled out for more than $100 million, with just
   over $30 million going to Eolas' co-plaintiff, the University of
   California.

   Meanwhile, Eolas' [14]original patent was getting serious attention. It
   was actually [15]denounced by the web's global standard-setting body in
   2003. That resulted in an unusual director-ordered reexamination at the
   US Patent Office, but Eolas somehow emerged unscathed.

   Eolas got a second patent similar to its first in 2009. By then, the
   business of "patent trolling" had matured and become fantastically
   lucrative. The company relocated to East Texas before [16]filing suit
   against 20 big companies, including Apple, Perot Systems, Blockbuster,
   eBay, Adobe, Google, Yahoo, and Amazon. Court documents show the
   company was seeking more than $600 million in January 2012, a damage
   demand that likely had inflated to more than $1 billion by the time of
   trial.

   The ensuing patent campaign earned Doyle, and his lawyers, tens of
   millions of dollars. Doyle lives in Chicago, where has given interviews
   to local media about his [17]philanthropic efforts, but he has
   steadfastly refused to discuss his inventions or the ensuing lawsuits,
   except when compelled to do so during litigation. By the end of the
   2012 jury trial, only Google, Yahoo and JC Penney had not struck deals
   with Eolas.

Appeal loss shuts down three other lawsuits

   Under Doyle's conception of his own invention, practically any modern
   website owed him royalties. Playing a video online or rotating an image
   on a shopping website were "interactive" features that infringed his
   patents.

   And unlike many "patent trolls" who simply settle for settlements just
   under the cost of litigation, Doyle's company had the chops, the
   lawyers, and the early filing date needed to extract tens of millions
   of dollars from the accused companies.

   Eolas had kept filing lawsuits even after its trial loss, with cases
   against Disney, ESPN, ABC, Facebook, and Wal-Mart on hold awaiting the
   outcome of this appeal; those are all but doomed. Those lawsuits had
   asserted the two invalidated patents as well as two new ones, but the
   two [18]newer [19]patents both incorporate Eolas' first patent.

   The patent-holding company's lawyers stayed those new cases
   voluntarily, acknowledging that the appeal would have a "material
   effect" on their case.

   The role of the University of California is one of the most perplexing
   twists in the Eolas saga. The university kept a low profile during the
   lead-up to trial; but once in Texas, Eolas' lawyers constantly reminded
   the jury they were asserting "these University of California patents."
   A lawyer from UC's patent-licensing division described support for
   Eolas at trial by simply saying that the university "stands by its
   licensees." (Eolas was technically an exclusive licensee of the
   UC-owned patent, which also gives it the right to sue.)

   At the same time, the University of California, and the Berkeley campus
   in particular, was a key institution in creating early web technology.
   While UC lawyers cooperated with the plaintiffs, two UC
   Berkeley-trained computer scientists were key witnesses in the effort
   to demolish the Eolas patents.

   Pei-Yuan Wei created the pioneering Viola browser, a key piece of prior
   art, while he was a student at UC-Berkeley in the early 1990s. Scott
   Silvey, another UC-Berkeley student at that time, testified about a
   program he made called VPlot, which allowed users to rotate an image of
   an airplane using Wei's browser. VPlot and Viola were demonstrated to
   Sun Microsystems in May 1993, months before Doyle claimed to have
   conceived of his invention.
