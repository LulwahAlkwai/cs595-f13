The Lies You've Been Told About the Origin of the QWERTY Keyboard

   The first time I heard the lie, I was in fifth grade. Mr. Ward took me
   aside (or maybe he told the whole class, it was a long time ago) to
   tell me about the wonders of Dvorak, a different keyboard layout that
   was scientifically designed to be more efficient than the standard
   layout. That layout was called QWERTY, he explained, and it had been
   created to slow typists down. You see, in the olden days, mechanical
   typewriters could jam if people hit the keys too quickly, so they had
   to put the common letters far apart from each other. The modern
   keyboard, I was told, was a holdover of the mechanical age.

   Since then, I've heard this story repeated a thousand times. So many
   times, I had assumed it was true. But [10]Jimmy Stamp over at
   Smithsonian points to [11]evidence released by Japanese researchers
   that, in fact, the story is bunk. The QWERTY keyboard did not spring
   fully formed from Christopher Sholes, the first person to file a
   typewriter patent with the layout. Rather, it formed over time as
   telegraph operators used the machines to transcribe Morse code. The
   layout changed often from the early alphabetical arrangement, before
   the final configuration came into being.

     The researchers tracked the evolution of the typewriter keyboard
     alongside a record of its early professional users. They conclude
     that the mechanics of the typewriter did not influence the keyboard
     design. Rather, the QWERTY system emerged as a result of how the
     first typewriters were being used. Early adopters and beta-testers
     included telegraph operators who needed to quickly transcribe
     messages. However, the operators found the alphabetical arrangement
     to be confusing and inefficient for translating morse code. The
     Kyoto paper suggests that the typewriter keyboard evolved over
     several years as a direct result of input provided by these
     telegraph operators.

   That is to say, the lesson of the QWERTY story remains the resilience
   of a design created for an outmoded technology's dictates. QWERTY is
   still an example of technological momentum. But the development of the
   design wasn't accidental or silly: it was complex, evolutionary, and
   quite sensible for Morse operators.

   Keyboard configurations are newly important as we think about how we
   should type on tablets and other devices. The calling card of the
   personal computer was the keyboard, and now, we are carrying around
   pieces of glass on which we simulate the old QWERTY design. Are we
   going to keep that layout going? Perhaps QWERTY will always be good
   enough. But if not, how might a new design develop?
