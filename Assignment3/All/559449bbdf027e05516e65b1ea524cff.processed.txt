[42]Bill Clinton Says 'Paint Your Roofs White' 722

   Posted by [43]Soulskill on Monday July 18, 2011 @04:20PM
   from the i'll-get-right-on-that dept.
   [44]Hugh Pickens writes "Former President Bill Clinton thinks 'every
   black roof in New York should be white; every roof in Chicago should be
   white; every roof in Little Rock should be white. Every flat
   tar-surface roof anywhere! In most of these places [45]you could
   recover the cost of the paint and the labor in a week.' Noting that
   Mayor Bloomberg started a [46]program to hire and train young people to
   paint New York's roofs white, Clinton says a big percentage of the kids
   have been able to parlay this simple work into higher-skilled training
   programs or energy-related retrofit jobs. The benefit: not only will
   'cool roofs' lower the utility bill in every apartment house 10 to 20
   percent, but it frees cash that can be spent to increase economic
   growth. Clinton presented this with fourteen [47]additional ideas for
   growing the economy, saving energy, and attacking the jobs crisis."

            Pigeons. Lots of Pigeons. Just sprinkle roof with bread
            crumbs, and get out of the way.

                 Okay, I'll go back in time and have them build my house
                 with those. I'll also make a plea to the homeowners
                 association to allow this while I'm there and maybe stop
                 9-11 from happening. Anyone else have any requests for
                 shit for me to do while I'm in 2000?

                      I hate to break this to you, but if you do own your
                      house, you will end up putting a new roof on it
                      sooner or later. My guess, given your tone, is that
                      it will be sooner than you think it will.
                      Now would be a good time to bring this up with your
                      home owners association so you can make the best
                      choice when that time finally comes.

                      Yeah, make home owners associations illegal.
                      They were supposed to be for paying for common areas
                      (tennis courts, pools, etc...) and to keep Mr. Trash
                      from putting his car on blocks in his front yard and
                      his pack of dogs in the back. Now, they've turned
                      into fascist organizations that will have their
                      lawyer fine you and charge you thousands of dollars
                      because you used the wrong color of beige on your
                      front door.
                      Why Home Owner's Associations bring down property
                      values:
                      1. if you live near folks who do those kinds of
                      things, an HMA isn't gonna do you much good AND if
                      you do need an HMA then you have trash living there.
                      2. Some of them have resale fees buried in the
                      covenants and sometimes hidden by the real estate
                      developer - bunch of fucking crooks in on it with
                      the bankers.
                      Now, I'm going to make some sweet and sour sauce
                      with this bitterness.

                 I think it costs more to cool down than to heat up, but
                 what happens if power goes out and there is no chimney?
                 Is the cost savings there after taking this into

                      A roof is white in winter because of the snow.
                      Said another way, we already have white roofs in
                      cold climates in the winter because the snow makes
                      the shingle color irrelevant.

                      The difference is even greater because in the
                      winter, there is less sunlight to do the heating.
                      The savings during the summer win hands down. If the
                      power goes out, the color of the roof is not going
                      to make an appreciable difference--unless maybe you
                      sleep in the attic. Never heard of anybody doing
                      that.

     What will white roofs do in the winter? Make the building colder?
                      I suspect they would actually make the building
                      warmer. It's a common misconception that black
                      absorbs heat while white reflects it. Well, that in
                      itself isn't the misconception, the misconception is
                      that people think of the heat transfer happening
                      only one way. Black is [217]more conducive to heat
                      transfer [wikipedia.org] than white. That means if
                      you have a black roof in winter (assume no snow),
                      and the inside of the house is warmer than the
                      outside, the black roof will radiate the interior
                      heat to the sky faster than would a white roof.
                      Think of white paint as a heat insulator, and black
                      paint as a heat conductor.
                      True, during daylight the radiation from sunlight
                      into the roof may exceed the radiation from inside
                      the house to outside. But days are short in Winter,
                      and I suspect the heat loss during the night far
                      exceeds the gain during the day.

                 1)Ridge vents can only be installed on pitched roofs.
                 Many large buildings do not have pitched roofs.
                 2)Painting a roof white requires no permits,
                 construction, tools (save paintbrushes and maybe
                 brushes/cleaning solutions), specialized skills, etc.
                 3)Titanium Dioxide, used to make many white paints white,
                 is a photo-catalyst, which means it can self-clean and
                 chew up pollutants in the air.
                 4)A ridge roof vent that is controllable requires control
                 systems and whatnot. White paint simply works.
                 #2 is particularly important for people with few
                 vocational skills...and landlords who, especially in NYC,
                 are really, really cheap assholes who view tenants as
                 human ATMs, and who won't do anything unless there's a
                 quick, proven payback.
                 Clinton's point is that white paint is cheap, easy,
                 simple, reliable, has virtually no operational
                 expenditure, and a quick payback. Installing ridge vents
                 shares almost nothing in common with his solution.

                 It costs about $10 to $15 per gallon, and covers about

                      If you're going to be that precise about it, you

     Ummm...I don't have a black asphalt roof on my home in Mesa, AZ. I
     have clay tiles.
                           IIRC, one of the reasons that traditional clay
                           tile roofs have been around so long,
                           particularly in warm climates, is that there is
                           a continuous flow of air between the tiles and
                           the underlayment due to natural convection. The
                           tiles may get quite hot, but the air flow keeps
                           most of that heat from reaching the rest of the
                           building.

            I'd use white roof coating, rolled on some test shingles
            nailed to a sheet of plywood before trying any specific
            coating on a home. It may take a couple of coats to cover. I
            would also consider a light gray coating if available.
            [296]http://www.roofcoatings.org/wcc.html [roofcoatings.org]
            The temp reduction is no joke. I coated the tops of my ISO
            container shop buildings and my metal house roof white. The
            ISOs are sealed, no windows (stormproof and keeps my gear dry)
            and get rather warm. White tops make them reasonable
            workspaces.
            I didn't add the glass microspheres one can buy to mix with
            paints and roof coatings, but I'll do that next time. (BTW I
            fucking HATE asphalt shingles. If I won the lottery I'd use
            steel trusses and modern standing seam roofing.)

                      The nice disadvantage of covering a roof with solar
                      panels is that in case of a fire barely or no water
                      will reach the fire.
                      If your roof lets water in, yr doing it wrong. The
                      whole point of a roof is to not water through.
                      (The reason that the firefighters spray water on a
                      roof in the first place is to keep old-fashioned
                      asphalt shingles from igniting-- if the roof is
                      fireproof, that's a feature, not a bug. By the time
                      the roof has burned through enough to let water into
                      the house, it's pretty much too late to save the
                      building.)

                           hoping the water goes in said holes; in which

                      Actually, considering how expensive it is to re-roof
                      a house, if you reroof with solar panels instead of
                      shingles, it's not all that much more expensive.

                           I've yet to see any savings. First I covered my
                           flat roof with solar panels, then to go
                           super-green I took the extra step of painting
                           them all white. The house not only isn't
                           cooler, but the energy efficiency of those
                           panels is abysmal!

                      Well...
                      A fairly small bit of googling will get you readily
                      assembled panels for $1.50/W.
                      [352]http://www.sunelec.com/solar-panels-c-5.html
                      [sunelec.com]
                      Admittedly, these require actually mounting on the
                      roof, and grid-tie inverters.
                      But let's ballpark these at $3/W.
                      In sunny Scotland, I pay $.25/kWh of power.
                      A 1kW panel produces around 900kWh/year of
                      electricity.
                      (
                      [353]http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/apps4/pvest.ph
                      p [europa.eu])
                      At current prices, this 1kW panel would produce
                      $225/year, or payback (neglecting interest!!!) in 6
                      years.
                      And I've just got notice that bills are going up
                      10%.
                      For 'solar laminates' - these are the bare glass
                      panels with solar cells on which need a frame made,
                      the cost is around $1/W, so payback can be lots
                      sooner in some cases.
                      (this assumes that I can simply backfeed the meter.
                      In the UK as it stands, you cannot do this)
                      For places with lower electricity prices, payback is
                      questionable.

       I've had white shingles for 8 years now -- chosen for this very
       reason. I turn on the A/C about 1/3 of the time my neighbors do
       (with black shingles). Saved me a lotta money :-) It's worth it

                 A black roof doesn't help you heat a house if it is
                 covered with white snow. And even the south, we spend
                 more on heating than cooling (winter is much farther from
                 75 degrees than summer is). Still, heating is more a
                 function of insulation, which isn't as effective for
                 cooling. Also, the angle of the sun means it is much less
                 effective an warming in the winter.
                 All Clinton jokes aside, painting a black tar roof white
                 or using a light colored shingle for a home IS a good
                 idea, and I have recommended it for years, because the
                 net gain in the summer is much better than the net loss
                 in the winter.

       I've priced this out for our condominium association and found that
       painting the roof white costs several thousand dollars per (rather
       small) unit - not worthwhile for the association certainly. That
       would pay the gas and electric bill for more than a year in most
       cases.
       And the reflectance drops 75% in 3 years, so you'll soon be doing

                 Exactly: There's much more sun in the summer than the
                 winter, i.e. white shingles will "help" in the summer
                 much more than they "hurt" in the winter, even if your
                 roof isn't covered by snow.
                 Also heating (especially if it's via a new gas furnace,
                 even the cheaper models are running over 90%, so
                 efficient their chimneys can be made out of PVC pipe) is
                 MUCH more efficient than even the best AC unit.

            No white is still better in the winter. Black roofing causes
            excessive melting of the snow during daylight leading to iced
            up gutters and ice dams at night which end up causing major
            water damage.

            Look. Just because somebody thought of something you haven't
            doesn't make them dumb. People have been talking about this
            for years, and *yes* they've taken into account the fact that
            you'd like to get solar heating from your roof in the winter.
            You don't get much solar heating in the winter at the latitude
            of New York because the days are short and the sunlight
            oblique. New York is at roughly 40 degrees of latitude, and
            midwinter the sun rises to less than 30 degrees of elevation
            off the horizon.
            The argument might make sense for La Paz, Bolivia, but not New
            York.

            ...all roofs in New York should also be painted black in
            winter, because damnit, it gets cold in New York in winter.
            During the winter, day is shorter than night, and your house
            is always heated to ~70F (both day and night). Hence, your
            roof will radiate energy for longer period (night) than it
            would absorb the energy (day). And black bodies radiate energy
            better than white ones. Conclusion is that it is better to
            have white roof during the winter.

            We live on the top floor of a small apartment building that
            has a flat roof, and with the landlord's permission, I painted
            it with aluminized roof coating at the end of last summer. I
            can now definitely state that our interior temperatures are
            about 10 F cooler than last summer (hey, we're geeks, we
            measured it). We still go above ambient, but only about 5 F
            instead of 15 F. It went from intolerable (there is no A/C) to
            not-so-bad, and the rest of the building shares the benefit,
            although much less than we do.
            I can't speak to how much more energy we're using during the

            I think you're getting confused. What matters most is
            reflectivity, not emissivity. The solar spectrum is most
            intense in the visible part of the spectrum (no surprise -
            that's why our eyes evolved to be sensitive to that part of
            the spectrum), and white paint is much more reflective in that
            part of the spectrum than black paint (by definition - that's
            what it means to be white!).
            And why are you quoting the emissivity of a particular paint
            at 3m wavelength? That's radio frequency. Solar energy in that
            frequency range is completely negligible compared to visible.
