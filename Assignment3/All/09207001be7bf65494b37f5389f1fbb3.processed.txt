Hands On With the iPhone 5S

    1. Apple-event-26

Introducing the iPhone 5S
       Apple unveiled the iPhone 5S -- along with a lower cost iPhone 5C
       -- at its Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, marking the first time
       two iPhone devices launched on the same day.
    2. Apple-event-24

iPhone 5S: Gold, Silver and Black
       The iPhone 5S -- which comes in gold, silver and black -- has the
       same overall physical design as the previous-generation iPhone 5,
       but it also has a number of upgrades.
    3. Apple-event-15

Sleek and Light
       The iPhone 5S measures in at 4.87 inches high, 2.31 inches wide and
       0.30 inches deep. It weighs less than 4 ounces -- 3.95 to be exact.
    4. Apple-event-17

Touch ID
       The iPhone 5S will include a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, allowing
       users to unlock their device with the touch of a finger.
    5. Apple-event-18

Fingerprint Sensor Technology
       Not only will this be a huge step forward in smartphone protection,
       it can also be used to make iTunes purchases. Instead of typing in
       a password every time you buy a song or app, pressing your
       fingerprint against the scanner will bypass that step.
    6. Apple-event-29

App Innovation
       Apple has re-engineered all the built-in apps -- such as Mail,
       Calendar and iPod -- for 64-bit architectures.
    7. Apple-event-14

Faster Processor
       The iPhone 5S comes with a powerful new processor: the Apple A7. It
       packs more than 1 billion transistors into a 102mm chip. It can run
       64-bit apps (all previous models ran at 32 bits).
    8. Apple-event-13

Improved Camera
       The iPhone's camera comes with major improvements, thanks to new
       sensors that have 15% more area and an f/2.2 aperture. It also
       comes with a dual-LED flash and new software features, such as
       filters and a burst mode that snaps 10 still pictures in one second
       with automatic image stabilization.
    9. Apple-event-22

Photo Collections
       Apple is making it easier to group photos and videos based on time
       and place. It's displayed almost like a mosaic on screen.
   10. Apple-event-21

Photo Sorting
       Photos can also be sorted by year.
   11. Apple-event-20

Panoramics
       The panorama feature captures a scene at an impressive 30 frames
       for each second. This is 50% faster than the iPhone 5.
   12. Apple-event-1

HD Video Recording
       The iPhone 5S lets you film in 1080p HD and touts a slow-motion
       feature at 120 frames for each second in 720p. This means you can
       take footage in regular speed and slow it down, for example, during
       a dramatic moment.
   13. Apple-event-16

iPhone 5S Cases
       Apple also launched a new lineup of iPhone 5 cases in a variety of
       colors.
   14. Apple-event-19

Availability
       The iPhone 5S will go on sale Sept. 20 in nine countries: the
       United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and
       the UK. Like previous generations, it will come with 16, 32 or 64GB
       of storage for $199, $299 and $399, respectively -- as long as you
       sign a two-year contract with AT&T, Verizon or Sprint (T-Mobile's
       installment pricing is somewhat different).

   Apple's new flagship phone, the [48]iPhone 5S, follows in the grand
   tradition of the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4S. It offers subtle, almost
   imperceptible changes on the surface, and a complete brain transplant
   underneath.

   While I can't pretend to truly know the iPhone 5S -- we had maybe 45
   minutes with it, total -- I can tell you that the transplant appears
   successful.

   The [49]Apple iPhone 5S clearly has some real power (a new A7 chip) and
   startling innovation: a fingerprint ID and home button all in one. No
   doubt there will be many more secrets to reveal when we get a chance to
   properly review the new smartphone.

On the Surface

   IFRAME: [50]https://vine.co/v/h1XM2a3rD70/embed/simple

   At first glance, it's quite easy to mistake the iPhone 5S for its
   predecessor. At the Apple launch event, I saw several instances where
   someone picked up another person's iPhone 5, thinking they were
   handling the new phone. The impression doesn't last long. First of all,
   there's the color. Apple's two new metallic finishes -- "space gray"
   and gold -- have an almost indescribable pop to them.

   There are two other external differences. One is pretty subtle and the
   other is, as I see it, a pretty big deal. The first is the LED flash,
   which is actually two flashes. Called True Tone Flash, these two LEDs
   are designed to ameliorate the effects of odd lighting (like
   fluorescents) on flesh and colors. In my limited time with the phone,
   it was hard to tell how effective this is.

   The second change is the iPhone 5S home button. It's in the exact same
   spot as it was on the 5, but something is missing: the square. You
   know, the one with rounded corners that's been on every iPhone since
   they were launched in 2007 (it's also on iPads and iPods). That change
   is a signal of something new and momentous underneath the hood.

Touch ID

   IFRAME: [51]https://vine.co/v/h1Xg9bJeWpg/embed/simple

   Apple's introduction of a built-in fingerprint reader was a poorly-kept
   secret. Still, the execution is impressive. Touch ID uses a
   microns-thin sensor under the home button's sapphire glass, just above
   the tactile sensor. First it remembers your fingerprint (thumb or
   finger), then reads it when you want to unlock the phone. I tried this
   out twice, and was impressed with how smoothly it went.

   Touch ID uses multiple passes to analyze your print. It advised me to
   repeatedly place my finger on the home button, and that I shift
   positions so it could get a complete read. You can watch it build the
   reading with each pass. With my thumb and index finger, the process was
   the same. Once it was done, I was able to store a name for my
   fingerprint.

   You can store multiple fingers. On one phone, both an Apple employee
   and I were able to log into the same phone using one of our two
   registered fingers.

   It takes 20 seconds or so necessary to register a finger. Logging in
   makes that time well worth the effort. You press the home button and
   hold it while it reads your finger. This happens in less than a second,
   so it feels like you're simply pressing to unlock the phone.

   Apple is storing the encrypted ID information at a hardware level.
   That's just how it should be done. Touch ID will be a significant
   selling point for the new phone.

Pictures

   Another significant change is the new iSight Camera. Apple updated both
   the build of the camera and the brainpower behind it. The new A7 chip
   (which also stores that encrypted security data) gives the camera all
   sorts of tricks, many of which brought to mind an expensive DSLR. The
   camera now starts analyzing the scene almost as soon as you hit the
   camera icon.

   It can do an exposure grid, auto image stabilization and even adjust
   exposure in real-time on a panorama shot. What Apple did not do was
   engage in the megapixel race. While some smartphone manufacturers are
   touting 13 and even 41 MP cameras, Apple stayed at 8. Instead, the new
   image sensor is larger and actually accommodates larger pixels.

   In a panorama shot of the demo room, which happened to have a large
   bright window, the iPhone 5s was surprisingly adept at auto-managing
   the exposure as I shot. Instead of an over-bright window with shadowed
   figures in the foreground, I got all the room detail. In a standard
   still, this would not be impressive. But in a panorama, the exposure is
   constantly changing. The iPhone 5s figured it out.

   Burst mode worked as advertised. I shot 20 or more shots by simply
   holding down the shutter button. The iPhone 5S collected all my shots
   and automatically identified the best-exposed and (to an extent)
   best-composed shots. We also tried this with a photo of my face. To
   test the iPhone 5S's ability to find good facial expressions, we shot a
   burst mode of me looking serious, smiling and then sad. The phone
   highlighted the best -- which were indeed the best -- and then I had
   the option of selecting those for inclusion in my film roll.

   Slow motion is a powerful feature that also lived up to its billing.
   The feature is one of the camera options. You can shoot your whole
   video in slow-mo and then, with an on-screen slider, choose which
   portions run at normal speed and which show off the 120fps shooting
   skills of the iPhone 5S. We tried shots with me waving. Each time, it
   just worked. Slow motion looked great on the iPhone screen.

Scratching the Surface

   There is quite a bit about the iPhone 5S I could not test. First of
   all, the phone is now a fully 64-bit device. This will give the phone
   more power -- and as with 64-bit computers, it may also simply allow
   the device to run with fewer problems.

   When I spoke to Donald and Geremy Mustard of Chair Entertainment, the
   company that makes Infinity Blade and that demonstrated [52]Infinity
   Blade III on the iPhone 5s, they said the new phone's 64 bitness gets
   the phone's other tasks (background, OS-level stuff) out of the way.
   They did note, however, that the iPhone 5S allowed them to flip on
   nearly all the visual special effects switches (reflections, fog and so
   on) in the Unreal engine, which drives the stunning imagery in Infinity
   Blade III.

   While I also couldn't test the new M7 coprocessor, an A7 companion
   piece of silicon that will read all the input from the built in
   accelerometer, gyroscope and compass, this could be one of the most
   important pieces of stealth technology in the phone. Apple introduced a
   CoreMotion API, which partners like Nike can use to build more
   comprehensive health and fitness apps.

   Apple could use this chip to drive interaction with another device: the
   long-rumored iWatch. The only question is whether Apple will wait to
   gather more telemetry from the M7 before launching the iWatch this
   year, or hold off until 2014. In the meantime, there's not much for
   typical consumers to see on the M7 front.

A Phone You Sort of Know

   The iPhone 5S is very familiar. Its size and weight are exactly the
   same as the iPhone 5. It has the same retina screen. All the buttons
   (besides Home) look the same. The biggest difference for most users
   will be iOS 7. Its new look combined with this more powerful phone and
   some of the landmark features -- iSight camera, Touch ID -- should make
   the iPhone 5S feel less like an upgrade and more like a reboot.
