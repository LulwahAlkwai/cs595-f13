   Over the past few weeks we've been hosting what's been dubbed the
   Summer Science Symposium - a recurring post where experts from a number
   of scientific disciplines convene in the comments and answer your most
   befuddling queries.

   Whether you want to know how the universe can be infinite and
   expanding, if the moon landing really happened, or how accurate the
   cheapo mail-order genetic tests could possibly be, we have someone here
   who can field those questions - and more.

   Our panel of experts include: [20]Dr. Brian Krueger, the current
   Associate Director of Duke University's Genomic Analysis Facility,[21]
   Phil Plait, author of Bad Astronomy, and former member of the Hubble
   Space Telescope team, [22]Henry Reich, the mind behind MinutePhysics,
   and [23]Brian Dunning, technologist, author, and host of Skeptoid, a
   weekly science podcast.

   We'll also have a special guest making occasional appearances (hint:
   he's a science ... guy), so check back often and submit your questions
   below!

   UPDATE: Our experts have left the building! Thanks for all your great
   questions!

   Gizmodo's Summer Science Symposium is part of the [24]Better State of
   Living Conversation Series and brought to you with the assistance of
   [25]State Farm^® -- who've always got you covered with tips and help
   that get you to a better State.
