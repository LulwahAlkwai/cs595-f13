   Interesting Infographic: Why Apple Isn't a US Company, It's As Asian
   Company.
   This has less to do with making a statement about Apple than it does
   about making a statement about the US. For instance, according to this
   Infographic it takes days to ramp up a new manufacturing site in China
   where it can take almost a year to do the same thing in the US. The
   problem isn't cheap labor it is time to market and that explains why
   Apple has nearly 20x the number of employees (direct and indirect)
   outside the US (mostly in China, Taiwan, and Korea) as in it. At the
   end of the Infographic are the references. Infographic in Finances
