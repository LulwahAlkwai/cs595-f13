31 Startups Twitter Has Acquired

    1. Summize

1. Summize
       July 2008 -- Twitter's very first [48]acquisition, Summize, was one

    2. Value%2520of%2520n

2. Values of n
       November 2008 -- Just as they were batting off offers of
       acquisition from Facebook, Twitter made an acquisition of its own,
       Values of n. The startup produced information management
       applications like Stikkit, a post -it note application, and I Want
       Sandy, an email assistant. Primary motive for the acquisition
       appeared to be [50]CEO Rael Dornfest, who still works at Twitter as
       a UX engineer.
       Image: Values of n
    3. Mixer%2520labs

3. Mixer Labs
       December 2009 -- Just as everyone from Google to Facebook was
       getting into location based services, (there was a time before
       Google Maps, believe it or not), Twitter acquired [51]Mixer Labs to
       keep themselves in the game.
       Image: Mixer Labs
    4. Atebits

4. Atebits
       April 2010 -- In an attempt to get some of the outside developers
       creating tools under its own wing, Twitter acquired [52]Atebits,
       maker of the Tweetie app for Mac and iPhone, marking Twitter's push
       into the mobile space.
       Image: Atebits
    5. Cloudhopper

       changes in Google Analytics data.
       Image: Smallthought Systems
    7. Fluther

7. Fluther
       December 2010 -- As Twitter's team continued to grow exponentially,
       Twitter [55]acquired Fluther, bringing four engineers and one
       designer to the Twitter flock. [56]Fluther is a question and answer
       service that is still operational today.
       Image: Fluther
    8. Tweetdeck

8. TweetDeck
       May 2011 -- For a cool $40 million, Twitter [57]picked up
       [58]TweetDeck, a third party developer dashboard application, which
       quickly became a favorite among power users, which it remains to
       this day.
       Image: Tweetdeck
    9. Adgrok

9. Adgrok
       May 2011 -- The team at [59]Adgrok shut down their servers to work
       on Twitter's monetization platform full time.
       Image: Adgrok
   10. Backtype

10. [60]BackType
       July 2011 -- Later that same summer, Twitter [61]acquired BackType,
       a social analytics tool that aimed to bring social media to the
       foreground to assist with business decisions. Backtype joined
       Twitter's platform team to develop tools for Twitter's publisher
       partners.
       Image: Backtype
   11. Bagcheck

11. [62]BagCheck
       August 2011 -- In an unusual acquisition, BagCheck joined the

   14. Summify

14. [68]Summify
       January 2012 -- Twitter kicked off 2012 by [69]picking up Summify,
       a social aggregation service that collects news stories from your
       various social networks and puts them in an easily consumable daily
       summary.
       Image: Summify
   15. Dasient

15. [70]Dasient
       January 2012 -- Twitter did another security boost with its
       purchase of Dasient, a startup which monitored websites for
       malicious codes, keeping them on or off dreaded security software
       blacklists if needed.
       Image: Dasient
   16. Posterous

16. [71]Posterous
       March 2012 -- Mobile blogging platform Posterous [72]joined Twitter
       in March of 2012. While the site remained in operation for a short
       time after its acquisition, it eventually [73]shut down its
       services in April 2013.
       Image: Posterous

       April 2012 -- A month later, Twitter acquired Hotspots.io to join

       the next to [75]join the Twitter flock. The startup was the

       campaigns.
       Image: RestEngine
   19. Nclud

19. [76]Nclud
       June 2012 -- While not a true acquisition, Nclud did [77]sell some
       intellectual property to Twitter in 2012. Additionally, the two
       co-founders of Nclud moved on to high level design roles at the
       social media site.
       Image: Nclud
   20. Clutch.io

20. Clutch IO
       August 2012 -- Twitter announced in August 2012 that its next
       acquisition would be A/B testing service Clutch.io. In addition to
       the [78]native app A/B testing service for iOS and Android, Clutch
       also provided [79]a toolkit for developing hybrid native/HTML apps
       for iOS, undoubtedly an important gain for Twitter.
       Image: Twitter
   21. Vine

21. [80]Vine
       October 2012 -- In what was certainly its most famous acquisition,
       Vine, [81]Twitter took a gamble on what the "next big thing" in
       social media would be -- a gamble that seems to have paid off.
       Image: Vine
   22. Cabana

22. Cabana
       October 2012 -- In that same month, Twitter bought mobile app
       platform Cabana and promptly shut it down in December, using the

       Image: Cabana

       January 2013 -- Again focusing on mobile apps, Twitter joined
       forces with the app crashing service Crashlytics at the beginning
       of 2013. The company continues to support existing customers like
       [83]TaskRabbit, [84]Yelp and [85]Kayak.
       Image: Crashlytics
   24. Bluefin%2520labs

24. [86]Bluefin Labs
       February 2013 -- Social TV analytics pioneer Bluefin Labs joined
       Twitter in February, [87]proving that Twitter is doubling down its
       efforts in social TV, where the network has been extremely
       successful.
       Image: Bluefin Labs
   25. We%2520are%2520hunted

25. [88]We Are Hunted
       April 2013 -- To launch its music discovery site, [89]Twitter
       Music, Twitter [90]acquired music discovery service We Are Hunted,
       which created trending charts for music played online.
       Image: We Are Hunted
   26. Ubalo

26. Ubalo
       May 2013 -- Relatively unknown scalable computing startup Ubalo
       became the [91]next to join Twitter in May. The startup simplified
       large scale computing down to just the code needed for analysis or
       processing and eliminating the worry of integration or scaling.
       Image: Twitter
   27. Luckysort

27. LuckySort
       May 2013 -- Again focusing on data, Twitter [92]acquired LuckySort,
       a startup with a specialization in data visualization. The
       company's product, known as TopicWatch, allowed users to analyze
       real-time trends on social media (including Twitter) and news
       sources. The startup moved to Twitter's HQ in San Francisco and
       shut down its own services.
       Image: Twitter
   28. Spindle

28. [93]Spindle
       June 2013 -- Known as "the discovery engine for the social web,"
       Spindle marked an important acquisition for Twitter at the
       beginning of the summer, following in the site's 2013 theme of
       acquiring data analytics startups. Spindle shut down as part of the
       acquisition and has moved to Twitter's San Francisco offices.
       Image: Spindle
   29. Marakana

29. [94]Marakana
       August 2013 -- To build [95]Twitter University, Twitter's
       engineering organization, which provides training to Twitter
       employees as well as opportunities to teach, [96]Twitter acquired
       Marakana, gaining access to a whole new community of engineers in
       the Bay Area as well.
       Image: Marakana
   30. Trendrr

30. [97]Trendrr
       August 2013 -- In another bid for social TV, [98]Twitter purchased
       Trendrr, a measurement and analytics service focusing on real-time
       social data for media and advertising.
       Image: Trendrr
   31. Mopub

31. [99]MoPub
       September 2013 -- Finally, in its most recent acquisition,
       [100]Twitter bought MoPub, a startup that helps clients monitor
       their mobile advertisements. This unsurprising acquisition is
       reportedly to help further develop the native advertising
       ecosystem, which will likely bolster revenue streams for the coming
       IPO.
       Image: MoPub

   [101]Twitter's looming [102]IPO brings up a lot of questions, the
   biggest of which being what going public will mean for the company's
   future.

   As any good history teacher will tell you, the best way to understand
   the future is to consider the past. An acquisition, whether it be for
   patents or talent or anything between, can speak volumes about a
   company's future plans.

   Twitter has made a whopping 31 acquisitions since its inception in
   2006, and it's easy to notice trends in the types of acquisitions the
   microblogging site has made. Namely, there is a focus on mobile and
   advertising, with a few notable acquisitions in other types of social
   media, such as [104]Vine and We Are Hunted, which went on to become
   [105]Twitter Music.

   direction do you think the company is moving toward? Let us know in the
