Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture: Programmability for WAN Networks

   Satish Katpally
   [63]Satish Katpally | July 8, 2013 at 11:10 am PST
   ([64]2 Comments)

   In my last two blogs I discussed the challenges Enterprises are facing
   for their WAN, the differences between Enterprise needs in their LAN
   and WAN, and how the traditional ONF model for SDN isn't practical for
   the Enterprise WAN.  Let's now look at how the new Cisco ONE Enterprise
   Architecture can address this.

   Cisco ONE Enterprise Network Architecture

   The new Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture based on [65]Cisco
   Open Network Environment (ONE) was introduced at InterOp Las Vegas
   during [66]Rob Soderbery's keynote, with a deeper dive in a blog by
   [67]Inbar Lasser-Raab  (shown in Figure 2). Briefly, the 3 layers are
   similar to SDN Architecture but are also vastly different in the
   following ways:

   ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture GameChanger
     * Network Element Layer:  The Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks
       Architecture is built upon a foundation of distributed intelligent
       and programmable network devices. As explained above, the case for
       an intelligent network device is strong for WAN and ONE Enterprise
       Networks Architecture comprises of intelligent network devices at
       the device layer.

     * Control Layer: This is not a centralized controller function as
       defined by SDN. This is more of a control layer that offers the
       following:
          + Automated Provisioning: With automated configuration of
            network devices, the Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks
            Architecture delivers speed and ease of provisioning across
            the entire Enterprise network. This eliminates the per-device
            provisioning and vastly improves the speed and accuracy of
            adding new services consistently across the network.
          + Analytics: The Control Layer also offers advanced analytics
            across the entire Enterprise network, LANs and WAN. The
            real-time analytics data is available for any applications to
            use as well as for IT to monitor and diagnose any network
            issues.
     * Network-Aware Application Layer: Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks
       Architecture enables applications and services to be network-aware
       by abstracting away the network in the Control Layer and making
       advanced network analytics available to the applications.
       Applications and services can now be smart about the network
       conditions and deliver an optimal user experience, securely, while
       simplifying IT operations.

   How Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture enhances Enterprise WAN
   programmability?
     * ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture is a 2-way street
          + Applications and networks are mutually aware in Cisco ONE
            Architecture which creates a robust ecosystem for resiliency,
            whereas SDN is a one-way street, with the SDN Controller
            centrally managing network devices, which does not scale to
            WAN networks for reasons explained above.
     * ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture scales to WAN networks:
          + SDN Controller architecture is limited in scope to L2 networks
            in a single data-center whereas the Cisco ONE Enterprise
            Networks Architecture brings programmability to LAN and WAN
            networks alike.
          + Programmability in WAN networks requires intelligent network
            devices that have programmatic access but are free to run
            distributed protocols that make the network much more
            resilient than with centralized control.
     * ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture Control Layer is simpler and
       agile:
          + The Control Layer does not have to reinvent complex topology
            control mechanisms and can easily query and maintain network
            wide analytics. These analytics are useful to the
            network-aware application layers.
          + With an SDN Controller over WAN networks, again, one reinvents
            the broken wheel of centralized end-to-end provisioning
            similar to legacy ATM circuit-switched networks. The SDN
            Controller complexity would be hard to manage and deploy.
     * Coordination Costs
          + The suggested ONF SDN architecture implies best of breed
            solutions for each layer. This can increase coordination costs
            for enterprises as they have to integrate different vendors'
            solutions into a complex WAN network topology and manage
            network throughput requirements across all the layers.
            Coordinating the development and rollout of a new application
            between all 3 layers over the WAN can be very expensive.
          + Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture on the other hand
            builds upon a foundation of intelligent Cisco network devices
            with proven data-planes that implement complex distributed
            protocols. Further, a simpler control layer that allows the
            ease and speed of provisioning new applications and services
            that can be provided by 3^rd party application developers.
            This increased business agility and enables enterprises to
            respond rapidly to new business opportunities.

   Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture brings the networks and
   applications closer together across the entire Enterprise network. It
   is all about creating a feedback loop between the applications and the
   network and allowing the applications to control the network at many
   levels. Cisco ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture provides the tools
   to make the Enterprise network programmable both in data-centers (LANs)
   and at distributed sites (WANs). This is true and effective openness of
   enterprise wide networks that increases the speed of the deployments of
   new services and applications. Through open APIs at each layer and deep
   access to network resources through programmability, Cisco ONE
   Enterprise Networks Architecture creates the mutual awareness of
   networks and applications. This mutual awareness helps enterprises
   overcome the WAN challenges.

   What's next:

   In the next few blogs I'll cover additional aspects of SDN and Cisco
   ONE Architecture.
     * Cisco ONE Architecture and ONE Enterprise Networks Architecture
     * Details around the control layer for ONE Enterprise Networks
     * Elaborate on Use-Cases in Branch and Campus networks

   Thanks for reading and please comment on any and all aspects. I look
   forward to your comments. Stay tuned for the next blog post.

       Your current "controlled availability" wall, with all the real info
       sealed off, is not helping.
