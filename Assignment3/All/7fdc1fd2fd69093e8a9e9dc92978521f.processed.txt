   Even though you're a criminal, you can still have a sweet life. That's
   the message of Grand Theft Auto V, the most beautiful, complex and
   story-driven entry of the franchise.

   There is something mythical and larger than life about the Grand Theft
   Auto series. Each game launches with a storm of excitement from fans
   and detractors who speculate how the latest game can top the extreme
   action, violence and spectacle of the previous title.

   Grand Theft Auto V bests it predecessors -- not because of cheap,
   tawdry tricks, but because it offers an expansive game with intriguing
   characters and activities that appeal to many play styles. Los Santos
   -- a fictionalized, semi-satirical version of Los Angeles and
   surrounding Southern California -- is a massive playground that offers
   ample excursion opportunities, criminal or otherwise.

A Triple Threat Generates TV-Caliber Drama

   Trevor-Franklin-Michael-GTA

   Grand Theft Auto was not known for its storytelling until GTA IV, and
   the tradition continues in this fifth installment. Through the main
   story thread, you'll meet three characters between which you'll
   eventually be able to switch at will during free play. Each of their
   unique abilities will come in handy during certain missions.

   The three-character approach almost feels like a television drama with
   diverging storylines instead of a video game with gimmicks.

   First, you'll meet Franklin, a young thug trying to escape his
   neighborhood and regular gang-banging activities. He comes off as the
   most sympathetic character in the game because half of his exploits are
   crimes gone wrong after friends pull him into bad situations. His
   conflict lies in trying to stay loyal to his roots, while avoiding
   getting entangled in yet another drug deal gone awry.

   Then there is Michael, a retired bank robber who's set for life in a
   nicer part of Los Santos. But he's not settling into retirement well
   and routinely visits a therapist to help him cope with his addiction to
   chaos. He is, by far, the most fascinating and complex of the three
   protagonists, and every time I got a glimpse into his murky past, I
   wanted to learn more. Once he connects with Franklin, he takes interest
   in his youth and talents, shaping him into a better criminal, which, as
   you can deduce, brings him back into the crime game.

   Grand-Theft-Auto-Trevor-Bike

   Trevor, which Rockstar describes as the most psychotic Grand Theft Auto
   character ever, rounds out the trio. While being a loose cannon makes
   for violent and deranged gameplay, it initially makes Trevor a
   one-dimensional, bottomless well of rage. That changes somewhat as his
   past is revealed, but I was least interested in his story.

   Changing between these characters is just as fun as Rockstar promised.
   Each one has his own strengths and weaknesses, his own stomping grounds
   in Los Santos and plenty of solo missions. If you get bored with what
   one is doing, you're just two clicks away from snapping into focus in a
   completely different world. Usually you'll find that character in the
   middle of one of his hobbies; I found Michael at the country club,
   Franklin throwing a ball to Chop, his Rottweiler, and Trevor passed out
   in his underwear in the desert.

Los Santos the Beautiful

   GTAV-Michael-skyline

   The city of Los Santos could almost be considered GTA V's fourth
   character because the game world is dynamic and never dull. Los Santos
   does for L.A. what Grand Theft Auto IV's Liberty City did for New York,
   but on a much grander scale.

   The game's map was [49]previously leaked, so gamers got a glimpse of
   the massive world. Yet that hardly prepares you for the amazing
   experience of actually exploring Los Santos and the surrounding smaller
   cities. Grand Theft Auto V makes you pre-load 7.8 gigs of content onto
   your console before you start playing, and the game has significant
   load times. But when you drive from one end of the game world to the
   other without encountering a single load screen, you'll realize it was
   worth it. It's a marvel what Rockstar has been able to do with current
   generation consoles, even as the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 loom on the
   horizon.

   The game world will delight you with small moments of cool design and
   big wow-factor surprises. Here are just a few of the cool things that
   struck me as I explored the world:
     * The radio stations of Grand Theft Auto are always memorable, but V
       offers a fantastic mix of modern hits and classics. I was
       especially impressed with the hardcore punk and classic country
       stations. The most interesting surprise is, since the game world is
       so big, you can lose signal from some stations and pick up others.
     * Southern California is nothing without its massive spaghetti bowl
       of freeways, and GTA V captures that headache perfectly. Thanks to
       this game, you too can experience the L.A. traffic madness for
       yourself, a real feat considering how many cars (with driver AI)
       are rendered on the screen at once.
     * Speaking of cars, you can drive every type, as before. The cars in
       this edition much more closely resemble their real-world
       counterparts. If you're tired of cars, you can always hijack a bus,
       18-wheeler, tow truck, motorcycle, four-wheeler, armored car,
       bi-plane, speedboat, jet ski, bicycle and more.
     * Want to play golf? Sure. Ride a Ferris wheel and check out the
       sunset from the top? No problem. Los Santos is brimming with
       diversions around every turn, and a lot are surprisingly tame. You
       can watch an arty foreign film or go hiking in the wilderness. The
       game hasn't lost its edge though: There are still plenty of strip
       clubs and seedy places to visit. Some of the late game activities
       can be surprisingly complex, too, as you learn the ins and outs of
       the stock market, property management and arms smuggling.
     * One of those activities is hunting, and Los Santos' animals do not
       mess around. I'm embarrassed to say I was eaten by a mountain lion
       after I rolled my Jeep in the desert.
     * You'll see lots of other crime happen around Los Santos, and you
       can decide to get involved or not. These random encounters can
       happen as you cruise through the city, so keep your eyes peeled.
     * Anyone who has lived in or visited the Los Angeles area will be
       especially tickled by GTA V's jabs at real life. There's a hot
       governor's race, and one of the candidates is a former actor and
       stuntman. There are complaints about the city's lack of football
       team. There are several celebrities in "Vinewood" that you can
       interact with, usually by making their lives worse. It's clear some
       of the game writers have a love/hate relationship with the city.

Better Mechanics Than Ever

   GTAV-Franklin-ride

   While previous GTA titles never lacked open-world creativity, they
   didn't always do much to improve games' main mechanics: the running,
   driving and shooting that are the signature of any Grand Theft Auto
   game. That all changes with this edition.

   Grand Theft Auto V's combat system improved greatly, and shooting feels
   natural and easy. It seems likely that Rockstar learned from last
   year's Max Payne 3 because weapon targeting and firing is snappy. The
   game will even auto-lock on a target once you spring out of cover,
   making fights against waves of enemies a joy to participate in. The
   world is chock-full of guns and modifications to suit any style of
   play, too, though I often found myself happy with whichever weapons I
   picked up.

   Also important to note for combat is your characters are much more
   fragile than in previous games. You won't be able to be a super hero
   and absorb bullets, and that encourages more strategic play and cover
   use than in previous GTA titles.

   Car handling also enhanced significantly. Grand Theft Auto always
   relied on great driving, but V tightens the controls and upgrades the
   car physics. While the game isn't so realistic that it isn't fun,
   you'll still have to think about how real cars handle when you drive,
   thus sharp turns at 90 miles an hour take finesse. Each car model
   handles differently, so it's fun to experiment and find ones you like
   or to modify your favorite cars.

Building Your Criminal Empire

   GTAV-plane-explosion

   The three characters stories' are primarily told through missions. Some
   missions are solo affairs and some intertwine. The solo story missions
   are as varied as they come and all relate to that character's
   motivations. You could go from Trevor attacking a rival meth lab to
   Michael rescuing his daughter from a boat full of porn stars. The great
   thing about the missions is they keep layering on new gameplay
   elements, so you'll never feel like you've just done something similar.

   The most interesting missions are the heists all three characters
   perform. These require planning: Players must select how they want to
   complete a mission, then hire a crew to help with the job. GTAV asks
   for a lot of risk-versus-reward decision making here because hiring
   less-experienced crew means they'll want a smaller cut, but they're
   more likely to screw up their portion of the job. Paying for good
   people will mean losing a bigger cut of the the spoils, but then
   there's less chance you'll have to deal with as many cops later.

   You also switch between different characters to experience the highest
   points of action from their points of view. You might inhabit Michael
   during the heist but Franklin during the getaway drive (his special
   skill) then Trevor during any confrontations with of groups, since he
   can "rampage" for a short time and soak up a lot of damage while in a
   rage-induced state. These are just some examples, and it's really fun
   to see what creative settings the game might toss you into.

   Grand-Theft-Auto-V-Heist

   Characters have individual side missions called "Strangers and Freaks,"
   which are also accompanied by cut-scenes and some story. These are some
   of the most interesting and memorable slices of gameplay. Some are so
   out of this world that they seem like they could have come from
   tongue-in-cheek open-world title [50]Saints Row IV. I'd highly
   recommend tracking down any "?" symbols that denote these missions as
   soon as you see them on your map.

   You can also pick up tasks through your smartphone, which each
   character carries. You'll receive calls, texts and emails, all
   containing timely missions or incentives to visit activities and
   stores.

Conclusion

   Grand Theft Auto V raises the bar again for realistic, modern
   open-world games, and redefines how truly "open" that world can be.
   You'll be confronted with so many choices in the game that your biggest
   problem will be figuring out what to do first. Rockstar plans to
   support the game with an multiplayer [51]add-on, coming in October,
   which means players will get mileage out of the title for a long time.

   The game is both beautiful and immersive, and the story is one of the
   best Rockstar has ever presented. Multiple characters bring a new depth
   to gameplay, and it's something I hope other games mimic in the future.
   It's amazing what the franchise has grown into while still keeping to
   its violent, sociopathic roots, and it makes me excited to see what a
   next-generation Grand Theft Auto will look like.

   Grand Theft Auto V is out Tuesday for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for
   $59.99.

The Lowdown

The Good

     * The richest, most interesting story of any Grand Theft Auto game.
     * A game world that takes your breath away with its diversity and
       attention to detail.
     * Ridiculously fun gameplay.

The Bad

     * The game pushes current-gen hardware to its limit, so expect long
       load times when you first start the game or fail a mission.
     * No PC version, which is a shame since the game would look even
       better on modern video cards.
     * Generally solid AI can flake out at the worst times during
       gameplay.
