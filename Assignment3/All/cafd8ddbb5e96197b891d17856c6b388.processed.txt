When Choosing a Job, Culture Matters

   by Bill Barnett  |   4:08 PM May 2, 2012

   Some organizations will excite you. They'll stimulate your success and
   growth. Others will be stressful. They may lead you to quit before
   you've accomplished much or learned what you hoped to. With [48]the
   pressure (or excitement) of finding a new job, it's all too easy to
   pursue a job opportunity or to accept an offer with only a hazy view of
   how the institution really operates. The path to an institution you'll
   like is to investigate the culture you're thinking of joining before
   you accept the position.

   Sean (name has been changed) is a master at this. He pursued a job
   offer at a Fortune 500 company to be the first Chief Administrative
   Officer (CAO). He was well-qualified, presented himself well, and got
   the offer. He'd been competing with capable people. He was proud he'd
   "won the contest."

   The next step was a return visit, after which he'd decide to accept the
   offer. Sean had already learned a lot about the company's businesses
   and some things about the organization. His priority now was culture
   and how the new position might fit: "I asked people, `What are you
   excited about? What are you proud of? Who are your close friends in the
   company? How does the group function together?'" Sean learned things
   like who the heroes were, what made them successful, and what his
   biggest challenges and opportunities would be in the job. The different
   people he met with were learning from his questions. It was almost like
   he already worked there, and they were jointly determining how to make
   the new role successful.

   Surprisingly, Sean turned down the offer. The new role was a misfit in
   the company's culture.

   As he learned more about the company, Sean questioned how he'd be
   viewed as the first CAO in a company where everyone else focused on
   bottom-line results. It was a highly performance-driven environment
   with lots of business units. Corporate staffs were secondary.

   "I asked how they'd keep score on me, how they'd really know I was
   making a difference," he said. "We never got to satisfactory answers to
   that question. They weren't hiding anything. This CAO position was a
   new one, and they didn't really know."

   Sean was concerned that this new position wouldn't fit in the company's
   culture, that he wouldn't really be accepted, and that it wouldn't be a
   springboard to the line job that he really wanted after two or three
   years as CAO. He might have made it work, but why take the risk?

   It's not uncommon for job seekers to enter organizations without
   understanding the culture and come away disappointed. When considering
   a new job, be sure to investigate the institution's culture. Consider
   these questions to guide you:

   1. What should I learn? Understand the organization's purpose -- not
   just what they say they're doing, but also how their purpose leads to
   decisions and what makes them proud. Learn how the organization
   operates. For example, consider the importance of performance, how the
   organization gets things done, the level of [49]teamwork, the quality
   of the people, how people communicate, and any ethical issues.

   Except for ethical issues, there's no absolute standard of what's best
   in organizational culture. Different purposes and different
   organizational features can be more or less appealing to different
   people. When you understand how the potential employer operates, you'll
   need to consider how well that matches your goals. Your target
   organizational culture is an important part of your aspirations.

   2. How should I learn? Read everything you can find about the
   institution, but read with a critical eye. Institutions have formal
   vision statements, and they often mention cultural topics in other
   public reports, but these documents are written with a purpose in mind.
   Independent writers take an independent perspective. They can be more
   critical, but they can miss details and get things wrong.

   Discuss culture with people in the organization. You'll talk to people
   in the interviewing process, of course. But you may learn different
   things if you meet others there who aren't involved in your recruiting
   process. Also talk to people outside the organization who know it --
   customers, suppliers, partners, and ex-employees. Their different
   experiences with the institution will affect their views, so ask about
   situations where they've seen the culture in action.

   3. When should I learn? It's hard to learn about culture at an early
   stage in your search. But your impressions can guide you to target some
   institutions and avoid others.

   Culture may come up in job interviews, although it may be complicated
   to do much investigation when you're trying to [50]sell yourself.
   People sometimes worry that discussing culture might make people
   uncomfortable and put a job offer at risk. [51]The culture topic is
   certainly not off-base, and it is necessary to know for future growth
   in the company. Hiring managers should expect it. Whether it's in
   interviews or after you have an offer, you'll do best if your questions
   show you're learning rapidly about the organization, [52]taking the
   employer's perspective, and beginning to figure out how to succeed
   there. Culture questions can cast you in a positive light. Sean's line
   of questioning confirmed the CEO's judgment to hire him, even if Sean
   didn't like the answers.

   What's your view of how culture affects the job search? Has culture
   played a part in how you choose your future employer?

   An adapted version of this post is included in the [53]HBR Guide to
   Getting the Right Job.
