   You are what they think you are: Ballmer's legacy is a lesson in image
   management
   Steve Ballmer was actually one of the most successful CEO's in the last
   decade, yes he didn't compare with to Jobs but then no one else did
   either. The only truly big miss was on mobile and that caught HP, Dell,
   Palm, Motorola, Intel, and Blackberry (among others) flat footed as
   well. They hit better than most on Cloud and Bill Gates, their Chairman
   remained the richest guy in the world and Microsoft one of the most
   profitable companies. But perception is 100% of reality and he didn't
   manage either his or Microsoft's perception well. Sometimes it's not
   what you do it's how people see what you do that truly matters. A
   lesson Obama could likely learn as well. This is the subject of my
   Digital Trends column this weekend:
