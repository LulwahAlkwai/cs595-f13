DNA glue directs tiny gel `bricks' to self-assemble

New method could help reconnect injured organs or build functional human
tissues

   Gel-bricks-605

   Gel bricks smaller than a grain of salt (top left) can be programmed to
   self-assemble into complex structures. The key is to attach a pair of
   connector cubes coated with matching DNA glue on the gel bricks that
   are meant to pair up.
   By Dan Ferber, Wyss Institute Communications

   A team of researchers at the [84]Wyss Institute of Biologically
   Inspired Engineering at Harvard University has found a way to
   self-assemble complex structures out of gel "bricks" smaller than a
   grain of salt. The new method could help solve one of the major
   challenges in tissue engineering: creating injectable components that
   self-assemble into intricately structured, biocompatible scaffolds at
   an injury site to help regrow human tissues.

   The key to self-assembly was developing the world's first programmable
   glue. The glue is made of DNA, and it directs specific bricks of a
   water-filled gel to adhere only to each other, the scientists report in
   the Sept. 9 online issue of [85]Nature Communications.

   "By using DNA glue to guide gel bricks to self-assemble, we're creating
   sophisticated programmable architecture," said [86]Peng Yin, a core
   faculty member at the Wyss Institute and senior co-author of the study.
   Yin is also an assistant professor of systems biology at [87]Harvard
   Medical School (HMS). This novel self-assembly method worked for gel
   cubes as tiny as a piece of silt (30 microns diameter) to as large as a
   grain of sand (1 millimeter diameter), underscoring the method's
   versatility.

   The programmable DNA glue could also be used with other materials to
   create a variety of small, self-assembling devices, including lenses
   and reconfigurable microchips as well as surgical glue that could knit
   together only the desired tissues, said [88]Ali Khademhosseini, an
   associate faculty member at the Wyss Institute who is the other senior
   co-author of the study.

   "It could work for anything where you'd want a programmable glue to
   induce assembly of higher-order structures, with great control over
   their final architecture -- and that's very exciting," said
   Khademhosseini, who is also an associate professor at Harvard-MIT's
   Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Brigham and Women's
   Hospital, and Harvard Medical School.

   To fabricate devices or their component parts, manufacturers often
   start with a single piece of material, then modify it until it has the
   desired properties. Other times they employ the practice used by auto
   manufacturers, making components with the desired properties, then
   assembling the components to produce the final device. Living organisms
   fabricate their tissues using a similar strategy, in which different
   types of cells assemble into functional building blocks that generate
   the appropriate tissue function. In the liver, for example, the
   functional building blocks are small tissue units called lobules. In
   muscle tissue, the functional building blocks are muscle fibers.
   Scientists have tried to mimic this manufacturing strategy by
   developing self-assembling systems to fabricate devices.

   Last year Yin, and his team reported in Science that they had developed
   minuscule DNA bricks, smaller than the tiniest virus, that could
   self-assemble into complex, nanoscale 3-D structures. He and
   Khademhosseini sought to create a similar, programmable,
   self-assembling system for mesoscale components -- those with edge
   widths ranging from 30 microns to 1,000 microns (1 millimeter). They
   focused first on creating a self-assembly system in which bricks of
   biocompatible, biodegradable gels called hydrogels assembled into
   complex structures. In future applications, small hydrogel bricks
   containing human cells could potentially be injected into the body. The
   bricks would assemble, then the cells would knit together to form
   functional tissue as the hydrogels broke down.

   In previous attempts to self-assemble hydrogel bricks into complex
   structures, the bricks often stuck to one another rather than
   assembling into the desired architecture. Yin and Khademhosseini needed
   a way to help each component stick only to specific partners, and to no
   other components. In other words, they needed programmable glue.

   DNA was ideal for the task. It stores genetic information as a sequence
   of four chemical "letters," or nucleotides, that bind in a specific way
   to complementary nucleotides (A to T, and C to G). A single strand of
   DNA adheres tightly to a second strand, but only if the second strand
   has a sequence of nucleotides that is complementary to the first. And
   even a short piece of DNA can have a huge number of possible sequences,
   which makes the glue programmable.

   The researchers used enzymes to multiply a snippet of DNA into long
   pieces called "giant DNA" that contained multiple copies of that
   snippet. When they coated hydrogel cubes with giant DNA, the cubes
   adhered only to partner cubes coated with matching giant DNA. Because
   scientists can synthesize snippets of DNA with any sequence they want,
   the giant DNA functioned as programmable DNA glue.

   To assemble hydrogel cubes into larger structures, they used smaller
   hydrogel cubes as connectors. They coated the connector cube with their
   DNA glue, then attached it to one of the six faces of a larger cube.  A
   large cube outfitted this way adhered only to other large cubes whose
   connectors had matching DNA glue.

   By placing connector cubes on various faces of the larger cubes, they
   programmed larger cubes to self-assemble into specific shapes,
   including a matching pair of cubes, a linear chain, a square, and a
   T-shaped structure.

   The method was so specific that when the researchers placed 25 pairs of
   matched cubes in a single pot, all the cubes located and adhered only
   to their partners. This ability to assemble multiple components
   simultaneously is called multiplexity, and the results show that the
   new system has the highest degree of multiplexity of all existing
   mesoscale self-assembly systems.

   "Designing a strategy that leverages the power of self-assembly used by
   living systems to direct construction of tissues from tiny component
   parts represents an entirely new approach for tissue engineering," said
   Don Ingber, the Wyss Institute's founding director."Peng and Ali have
   created an elegant and straightforward method that could permit tissues
   to be reconstructed from within after a simple injection, rather than
   requiring major surgery."

   This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Office
   of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, and the Wyss
   Institute. In addition to Yin and Khademhosseini, the research team
   included Hao Qi, a postdoctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute; Majid
   Ghodousi, a research assistant at the Wyss Institute; Yanan Du, a
   former postdoctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute who is now a professor
   of biomedical engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing; Casey
   Grun, an undergraduate researcher at the Wyss Institute; and Hojae Bae,
   a former instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who is now an
   assistant professor of bioindustrial technologies at Konkuk University
   in South Korea.
