NHS efficiency savings: the role of prescribing analytics

   The NHS has been challenged to make £20 billion in "efficiency savings"
   by 2015 [11](1). £10 billion a year are spent by the NHS on essential
   drugs. Often, there's a choice between a cheap "generic" medication, or
   an expensive "branded" one. Branded drugs can cost over ten times as
   much, for the same therapeutic benefit. "Prescribing Advisors" in the
   NHS, with the support of NICE, encourage doctors to use the most cost
   effective treatments. We have analysed exactly how much is spent on
   expensive "branded" medicines, for one class of drugs, namely statins,
   in England.

   Where generic alternatives exist, NHS purchasing of branded drugs has a
   number of effects:

   1. There is only a finite amount of money to spend on treatments.
   Prescribing a patient expensive branded drugs, when cheaper equivalents
   would have the same therapeutic effect, means that money is wasted. As
   a result the NHS has less money to spend on the care needed by other
   patients.

   2. Older, cheaper drugs may be safer, since they have generally been
   tried and tested in more people.

   3. Drug companies make drugs to make money. If we spend hundreds of
   millions of pounds on branded drugs that produce - at best - a small
   incremental benefit, then this may not encourage genuine innovation, to
   discover new "breakthrough" treatments.

   Prescribing variation is a complex issue, and sometimes there are
   legitimate clinical reasons for a doctor to use an expensive branded
   drug. However, variations in prescribing practice suggest that there
   may be an opportunity to save money. Clear feedback on spending to
   doctors, NHS managers, public health practitioners, government, and the
   public can help to identify potential savings. We aim to help the NHS
   find opportunities, at a time of great change and financial pressure,
   by identifying and mapping prescribing variation against NICE guidance
   [13](2), using open data.

   The map referenced above shows one example: variation in GPs'
   prescriptions of statins, which are used to lower cholesterol. It shows
   the percentage of statin prescription items in two classes of branded
   statins, at CCG level. NICE guidelines for that period said that the
   generic Simvastatin should be a default option for patients. Wherever
   the percentage of branded items is high, it represents potential to
   make big savings by switching. For example, if two thirds of the
   proprietary drugs had switched to the generic forms of the same drugs
   in the year to June 2012, this would have saved £200 million pounds.
   Any savings could be used to help other patients.

   money, or cost effectiveness, of available treatments.

Other drugs

   Statins are just the start of this story. Our preliminary analysis of
   several other drug classes suggests statins are just the tip of the
   iceberg in UK prescribing variation, and potential savings. We are
   developing tools to help all interested parties to make the most of the
   NHS - please [16]sign up to learn more.
