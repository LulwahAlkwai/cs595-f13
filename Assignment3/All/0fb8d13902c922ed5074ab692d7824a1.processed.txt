[64]An Open Letter to White Male Comedians

   [ku-bigpic.jpg]

   Hey guys*: Listen, I know you're mad at me. I mean, maybe not me
   specifically, but a figurative "me"--the type of woman who thinks she's
   funny, who thinks she understands comedy, who has opinions (and shares
   them) about what kinds of jokes comics "should" or "should not" tell.

   I speak up for women, which sometimes involves criticizing men. I don't
   believe that "rape jokes" should be a completely unregulated market.
   And I understand that, to you, criticizing a comedian's execution on
   certain subject matters can seem indistinguishable from censorship and
   conservatism. So I know you're mad at me and I know why.

   But comedy has a serious gender problem, and I really can't stop
   complaining about it until it's fucking fixed. Comedy clubs are an
   overtly hostile space for women. Even just presuming we can talk about
   comedy gets women ripped to shreds by territorial dudes desperate to
   defend their authority over what's funny. "Jokes" about rape and
   gendered violence are treated like an inevitability instead of a
   choice; like they're beyond questioning; like they're somehow equally
   sacred alongside women's actual humanity and physical sanctity. When
   [65]women complain, [66]however civilly, they're met with
   condescension, dismissal, and the tacit (or, often, explicit) message
   that this is not yours, you are not welcome here. It's fucked up, you
   guys. And I'm saying that as a friend with the best intentions.

   Comedy has always been my go-to art form--it's been more valuable to
   me, in terms of emotional solace, than film or music, and it's
   certainly on par with literature. I know a lot of you can relate to
   that feeling. That doesn't mean I have the same perspective as, say, a
   hardened road comic, but I get paid to perform on stages, in various
   contexts, all the time. I've done stand-up in a brightly-lit pizzeria
   at 6 pm in front of four people who were not informed that there would
   be comedy (try it, it's great). I've written a weekly comedy column in
   the newspaper. Most of my friends are comics (many of them are white
   males!) and my boyfriend is a comic. But I get that there's no amount
   of experience that could give me "cred" with every single one of you,
   and anyway, these goal posts are easy to move--even if I were a
   full-time comic, you could always say I wasn't "good enough" for my
   opinion to matter. (Plus, it's no secret that plenty of people don't
   think female comics [67]count as comics at all.) So fuck it. Whatever.
   What I'm saying here is that [68]I'm not a fucking tourist. I'm not a
   bachelorette party. And if you're not performing for people like
   me--discerning lifelong comedy fans--then I don't know why you're doing
   comedy at all.

   More importantly, though:

   I have more experience doing comedy than you have being a woman.

   And I want to try and convey to you, broadly, how you are hurting women
   and hurting your own art form, and how easy it would be to stop.
   Because right now you're coming across like a bunch of entitled babies
   terrified of a few girls in your clubhouse--demanding that women be
   thick-skinned about their own rapes while you're too thin-skinned to
   handle even mild criticism. It's embarrassing.

   Listen. Being a woman is a bitch. Not only does everyone treat you like
   a fucking idiot all of the time, being a woman can be scary! Not scary
   in a big, obvious, goofy way--it's less like a horrible slavering dog
   running toward your face (except for when it is like that) and more
   like when you can't find that huge spider you saw on your bed earlier
   (if spiders also had the capacity to transform into slavering
   face-hungry dogs). We're not walking around actively terrified in the
   middle of the afternoon, but there's always a small awareness that we
   are vulnerable simply because we are women. Cavalier jokes about
   domestic violence and rape (jokes that target victims, not
   perpetrators) feed that aura of feeling unsafe and unwelcome--not just
   in the comedy club, but in the world.

   Women are 50% of the population, but when it comes to our interests and
   grievances we're treated like a niche group. Think about how crazy that
   is. You don't know what it feels like to be a part of the group that
   has never gotten to be the president. You don't know what it feels like
   to get up to do your set and hear, "Here's your obligatory girl comic
   for the night." You might not relate to any of that, but you can
   perceive why it's bad, right? How it puts damaging limits on women's
   lives?

   That's hard to live with, but it's especially hard--as a comedy fan and
   a woman who writes jokes for a living--to watch that paradigm being
   perpetuated by people I look up to as bastions of sanity on pretty much
   every other social issue. It sucks to hear your heroes telling you to
   sit down and know your place. Molly Knefel has an impeccable piece in
   Salon today about the disparity between male comics' reactions to rape
   and their reactions to other types of violence:

     As eloquent as Oswalt's message about Boston was, it is not
     particularly challenging to side with the victims of a horrible act
     of violence committed against civilians. Americans are united in
     their desire to condemn such atrocities. Many comedians, including
     Oswalt, also condemned the Aurora theater shooting and made an
     explicit point not to joke about it. None of this is to compare
     these different types of violence, but to offer an observation on
     the types of violence that are universally condemned as opposed to
     culturally sanctioned. The consensus formed by the majority-male
     comedy population is that sexual violence is not just OK to joke
     about, but joke about with extraordinary frequency and viciousness,
     where the targets of the jokes are the victims, not the
     perpetrators.

   Knefel, of course, is currently being lambasted by aggrieved male
   comedians. So aggrieved, you guys! Always so aggrieved! But why? What
   did she really say that's so outrageous? That the oft-silenced victims
   of sexual assault and domestic violence (which includes men and boys,
   by the way) deserve as much respect and care as the victims of gun
   violence? If basic compassion is such anathema to you, but only when it
   comes to "women's issues"--if you're determined to go down with the
   Good Ship Rape--then you have issues with women. And that's not women's
   fault--it's yours.

   If you just don't care, that's fine--that's your choice--but understand
   this: I know you think you're being transgressive and edgy and
   bad-in-the-cool-way when you are careless with the trauma of strangers,
   but you're not. You are being conservative. You are a conservative
   comedian. You are moving your art form backwards, you are a bully (a
   bully who has likely experienced bullying himself, which is the worst
   kind), and you are propping up the status quo in the most boring way
   possible. If that's what you want, at least have the grace to own it.

   Comedy and social responsibility are not mutually exclusive. Comedy and
   empathy are not enemies. And no subject matters or words are off
   limits, in the abstract. (Though, as I've written before, I'm pretty
   sure there are literally hundreds of things to joke about that don't
   involve the violent invasion of my vagina!) You do not have to stop
   talking about rape. [69]I've made my feelings clear on that matter and
   won't be wasting much time on specifics here. You do not have to stop
   talking about your bitchy ex-girlfriend. You do not have to stop
   talking about race or class or midgets or whatever the fuck you think
   is worth talking about (though you should probably stop talking about
   midgets, seriously). But you do have to live with the consequences of
   what you say, and how your words color people's perceptions of what
   kind of human being you are. If you do nothing but shower your
   audiences with hate and garbage, they're going to start thinking of you
   as a hate and garbage machine.

   To paraphrase white male comic [70]Derek Sheen (who was kind enough to
   let me pick his white male brain in the course of writing this
   article--big ups also to [71]Guy Branum), you are more than welcome to
   style yourself the bloody, shit-covered G.G. Allin of comedy. But when
   people get mad at you for smearing feces on them, you don't get to
   feign outrage at those people, because FECES IS DISGUSTING. Are you
   seriously trying to sit there and tell me that feces isn't disgusting?
   IT'S FECES.

   Now. You can talk about controversial subjects--in fact, you should
   talk about controversial subjects, because comedy is an incredibly
   powerful subversive tool--but if you want people like me to stop
   bitching at you (a dream we share, I promise!), you need to stop using
   your comedy to make those things worse. You don't have to make things
   better--you are under no obligation to save the world--but if you are
   actively making things worse for people, especially when you are not a
   member of the group whose existence you are worsening, don't be
   surprised when people complain.

   If you're an able-bodied straight white male, you are by definition a
   member of the least number of systemically oppressed groups. It takes
   an entire blog post for me to make you feel diminished and
   misunderstood (my bad)--but you could do that to me or a gay person or
   a trans person or a person of color or a disabled person with just a
   word. Because you get to live your life on the firm ground of being a
   human being first and a man/white person/comedian second. I don't get
   to do that. I'm not a person, I'm a woman, which is something I'm
   reminded of incessantly any time I enter a male-dominated space like a
   comedy club.

   Having had approximately one million conversations like this before,
   I'm pretty sure I'm familiar with all of the things you have to say to
   me in response. (For a case study in how these "dialogues" nearly
   invariably play out, this is a must-read: Sady Doyle's measured,
   impassioned, well-researched [72]plea about rape jokes, and comedian
   Sam Morril's [73]prototypical response.) So just to save time, let's go
   through them one by one.

   1. But [members of x group] make jokes about [xyz subject] too.

   Sure they do. Some women make smart, constructive jokes about rape
   culture on stage. That's great. Some women make lazy, shitty, harmful
   rape jokes on stage. That's less great. Some women also marry Donald
   Trump, but that doesn't make marrying Donald Trump a great plan for
   women. And regardless, surely you're caught up on how context and
   reclamation work. A person making fun of issues within their own
   cultural group--issues that they intimately and viscerally understand
   and are affected by--is not the same as you making fun of a cultural
   group in whose oppression your cultural group is complicit. Basically,
   be careful when you're handling other people's valuables.

   2. But comedy is trial-and-error. I need this stage time to perfect my
   act.

   It's the process. It's how comedy works. Sure. But here's the thing. I
   write jokes every day. Every day I write a bunch of jokes about very
   serious subjects, as quickly as I can (blogs move fast), and then two
   minutes later they go up on the internet where millions of people read
   them. I don't have the luxury of workshopping a joke for months. So
   don't tell me that it's impossible for you to discern in advance what
   will be genuinely harmful and what won't. If you actually give a shit,
   you can take the time to craft something that doesn't throw exploited
   and marginalized people under the bus for a cheap laugh.

   We all make mistakes. I am not angry at you for your mistakes. I've
   written plenty of things I regret, and we all say unthinking, clumsy
   things in off-the-cuff moments. But part of being a human being who's
   committed to craft, novelty, and the evolution of ideas is owning your
   mistakes. If you begin hearing from a lot of people that a joke is
   hurtful or regressive (beyond just "I don't like that joke"),
   especially if they are all members of a group whose experience you do
   not share, how hard is it to just listen? If you're really committed to
   "workshopping" your shit, you owe it to yourself to hear them, assess
   your responsibility, and have enough humility to accept that you might
   be wrong.

   3. But it's just a joke. Calm down.

   Yeah, dude, but this shit isn't magic. It's not a game. It's not like
   you get to declare the comedy stage "base" and the rest of the world
   "hot lava" (spewing from the vaginas of feminazi gargoyles, I'm sure)
   and everything you say on the stage exists in some sacred loophole
   that's exempt from criticism and the expectation of hard work. Rape,
   domestic violence, brutalization, marginalization, the struggle to make
   yourself heard--all of this shit is REAL to a lot of people. They're
   not cute little thought experiments for you to mess around with without
   pushback. You can lie to yourself all you want, but if you say
   something awful to somebody in the course of your regular day, it is
   exactly the same as if you say it on stage. If anything, its emotional
   impact is magnified.

   And anyway, anyone who says "but it's just a joke" has never had their
   life profoundly changed by a joke.

   4. But Louis CK!

   Ugh, this part is so boring. Okay. Do you know what else Louis CK does?
   He changes. He evolves. He thinks. And when he fucks up, he gets
   criticized like crazy, and some of that criticism makes it into his
   brain--and, eventually, his act. Also, just because one of comedy's
   sacred god-kings manages to be funny and smart when broaching certain
   sensitive topics doesn't mean they can't also be harmful. You know,
   Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. Etc. Just because Jeffrey Ross can
   (debatably) pull off a "haha, faggot" once in a while doesn't mean that
   identical "haha, faggot"s aren't actively moving gay kids to kill
   themselves all over the fucking country. It's real, and it deserves
   critical thought, not kneejerk defensiveness.

   Also, you're not Louis CK. Maybe don't invite the comparison.

   5. But comedy is subjective--lots of people do laugh.

   So? People are terrible. At least, like, half of people are terrible.
   And beyond that, people laugh for all kinds of reasons. People will
   laugh to cover up the fact that they don't get a joke, people will
   laugh at shock-value buzzwords like "rape" and "midget," and people
   will laugh to fill silence if the night turns awkward. If that's enough
   for you--cobbling together your validation from whatever misguided
   laughs you can drag out of your audience--then I question your
   commitment to this art form. Don't you want to make something?
   Something that comes from inside of you--that's a creation rather than
   just a reflection?

   If you really think comedy is entirely subjective, then there's no such
   thing as a "bad room." Any time you don't get a laugh, it's 100% on
   you. Enjoy that, if that's what you want.

   6. Stop being so sensitive. If you don't like it, don't listen.

   Nope. I have as much of a right to be here as you do and I will not be
   elbowed out of this space anymore without complaint. I also have a
   right to go out and do my job (sometimes my job takes place inside a
   comedy club or theater) without being reminded that I'm just a bag of
   disposable fuck-holes taking up space that isn't mine. Nope.

   Women are already excluded from this boys' club. Telling us to get the
   fuck out if we don't like being excluded is the opposite of a solution.
   I also have the right to complain about odious shit that marginalizes
   human beings I care about. Nope nope nope.

   7. Stop silencing me.

   Please. You are not being silenced. There is no "thought police." Your
   freedom of speech is firmly intact. You are a member of the single most
   powerful political bloc on earth. Your voices and your perspectives
   saturate nearly all media. You are fine. We are just having a
   conversation about your art, and your art is what you care about the
   most, right? Right?

   I know I just wrote 8 trillion fucking words about it, but really, this
   whole mess is simple. You get to choose what kind of a person you want
   to be. Do you want to cause pain or release tension? Do you want to be
   careful or careless? Do you want to confront hard things or take easy
   outs? Do you want to connect with other human beings about the shared
   horrors of the world or do you want to feed into a culture that
   perpetuates those horrors? You can do whatever you want, but you can't
   stop me and everyone else who hears you from telling you when you're
   full of shit. Comedy isn't yours. It's ours.

   Love (really),

   Lindy

   *No, not all guys. The end.
