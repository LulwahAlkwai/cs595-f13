Up until now, I've considered myself more of a realist. It's important to me to look for truth wherever I can find it, even if the truth is painful.</p><p>What I've discovered, however, is that changing your thought life has very little to do with embracing \"positive\" thoughts and getting rid of \"negative\" ones. It's more about telling yourself the whole story, and not just the one that supports your beliefs (especially beliefs that are keeping you from living the life you want).</p><h2>I'M DECLARING OCTOBER \"INTERNAL DIALOGUE AWARENESS MONTH\"</h2><p>My purpose for Hello, Month is to make every month the best month ever.&nbsp;I've spent years creating exactly the life and business that's perfect for me...and I still struggle with anxiety. I'm living proof that your outward circumstances have little to do with the state of your heart and happiness.</p><p>I'm learning that if you can change your thoughts, you can change your entire world without moving an inch.

      <div class="body"><p>September was amazing,&nbsp;<a href="http://hellomonth.com/hello-september-2013/">just like I hoped it would be</a>.&nbsp; I started going to therapy, and lo and behold, it actually works. Astonishing.<br></p><p>One of the biggest things that's helped with my anxiety is the process of changing my thought life. It's slow work...I've never been great at positive thinking. Up until now, I've considered myself more of a realist. It's important to me to look for truth wherever I can find it, even if the truth is painful.</p><p>What I've discovered, however, is that changing your thought life has very little to do with embracing "positive" thoughts and getting rid of "negative" ones. It's more about telling yourself the whole story, and not just the one that supports your beliefs (especially beliefs that are keeping you from living the life you want).</p><h2>I'M DECLARING OCTOBER "INTERNAL DIALOGUE AWARENESS MONTH"</h2><p>My purpose for Hello, Month is to make every month the best month ever.&nbsp;I've spent years creating exactly the life and business that's perfect for me...and I still struggle with anxiety. I'm living proof that your outward circumstances have little to do with the state of your heart and happiness.</p><p>I'm learning that if you can change your thoughts, you can change your entire world without moving an inch. If you'd like to join me, spend some time on the site this month. October is going to be the best month yet.</p><p>Happy October!</p><p><em>Love, Sarah</em></p></div>

      <div class="body"><p>Dear Me, </p><p>Remember in college when you learned about logical fallacies? You got really good at spotting invalid arguments -- arguments that could not possibly be true because they didn't follow the rules of logic. </p><p>Unproductive thoughts are a lot like that. When you have a thought that follows an unproductive pattern, you know you're not telling yourself the whole story. You need to find different reasoning to support your beliefs. If you can't, then the only reasonable thing is to change your beliefs to line up with the truth.</p><p>Take a look at this list of Unproductive Thoughts. Today, if you notice yourself feeling sucky, make a list of the thoughts running through your head. Then take those thoughts and see if any of them follow these thought patterns. </p><p>Love, </p><p>the You who is climbing great heights</p></div>

You think if your fears were to take place, it would be awful. But even if your circumstances were to become legitimately unfortunate, they are rarely debilitating.  Even the worst situations bring possibility on their heels, because they force you to let go of things that were taking tremendous energy to hold on to.</p><p>What are you afraid of? Today, remember that you are resilient and strong. It's unlikely that your fears will be realized, and even if they do, you can handle anything in the moment. It may even be possibility calling. Let go.</p><p>Love, </p><p>the You who can do this</p></div>

The trick is to consciously notice them, and be as specific as you can.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, I am noticing this beautiful notebook I'm writing in, which is the perfect size and weight to hold my thoughts.

To make that assumption is to close yourself off from meaningful connections, since all close relationships require vulnerability.</p><p>Today, notice any rules you've made to protect yourself, consciously or unconsciously.
