   A new statewide poll found 66 percent of voters saying they will
   "definitely" or "probably" vote for [113]Initiative 522, which puts
   labeling requirements on genetically manufactured foods and seeds
   offered for retail sale in Washington.

   Agribusiness interests and major grocery chains spent $46 million to
   narrowly defeat a similar initiative in California last year. Until
   Monday,  they have reported raising $3.264 million for the
   [114]No-on-522 campaign in Washington, a war chest that trails the
   money so far raised by initiative supporters.
   [115]Tim Eyman comes to Olympia bearing initiative petitions. He is
   being investigated by the Public Disclosure Commission.

   Tim Eyman:  His latest initiative -- which would prevent interference
   with signature mercenaries -- leads in a new statewide poll.

   But that changed early Tuesday.  Montsanto just put $4.592 million into
   the No-on-522 campaign, a sure sign that Washington is in for another
   big money corporate-fueled campaign in the next two months.

   The new Elway Poll, which interviewed 406 voters earlier this month,
   found 43 percent "definitely" backing the initiative, its support
   highest among higher income voters and Democrats.  Just 21 percent of
   those surveyed said they likely or definitely intend to vote no.

   Supporters plan to make a splash Wednesday, with celebrity endorser
   Jerry Greenfield, who co-founded Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, along with
   executives from Whole Foods and PCC Natural Markets.

   The Seattle City Council has endorsed the initiative.  So has
   Seattle-base attorney Bill Marler, the nation's top litigator of food
   safety lawsuits.

   The initiative has been denounced by conservative newspaper editorial
   writers as unnecessary and a potential burden on Washington
   agriculture.

   The Elway Poll also found an advantage for Tim Eyman's latest statewide
   ballot initiative.

   [116]I-517 would penalize those who allegedly interfere or retaliate
   against those collecting signatures on initiatives -- principally paid
   employees of signature-collection firms -- and extend the time allowed
   to collect enough signatures to make the ballot.

   The support level for I-517 is currently at 58 percent. But there is
   room for opponents to do persuading. Just 19 percent said they would
   "definitely" vote for the Eyman initiative, while 39 percent listed
   themselves as "probable" supporters. Twenty-two percent voiced an
   intention to vote no.

   Eyman initiatives have confounded pollsters in elections past.

   An effort to stymy collection of tolls on state highways, and block
   Sound Transit light rail from crossing Lake Washington, led in polls
   two years ago but saw its support collapse in the campaign's waning
   days. Other Eyman transportation measures have faltered.

   With Eyman's tax-limitation measures, however, polls have a dropoff of
   support, only to see passage by comfortable margins in November.

   [117]A campaign against I-517 is being planned, and had its organizing
   session two days ago.  Its organizers have refused to tell anybody what
   they're going to do.

   The Elway Poll was conducted Sept. 3-5 and has a margin of error of
   plus/minus 5 percent.
