   People attending the "Let Freedom Ring" ceremony yesterday, featuring
   President Obama, were expecting to hear from Philip Agnew, executive
   director of the Dream Defenders in Florida, and Sofia Campos,
   chairperson of the immigrant rights youth-led organization United We
   Dream. Both names were listed on the ceremony's program. But as Agnew
   was about to take the stage, he was told that he could not speak.
   Campos was also told she could not speak.

   Talk about [18]civil rights action interrupted, the Dream Defenders
   camped out in the Florida capitol building in Tallahassee for a full
   month in protest of the George Zimmerman verdict, and to demand new
   laws that would dismantle school-to-prison pipelines, racial profiling
   and Stand Your Ground gun laws. Campos, 24, is helping lead a movement
   demanding humane immigrant rights reform, which has called out
   [19]Obama on his record-setting deportations.

   Agnew is now calling for people to publish their own dream speeches on
   video and post them on Twitter and Facebook. The Dream Defenders are
   [20]releasing today a video of the speech Agnew was going to deliver at
   the ceremony yesterday.

   "This is about more than the speech," said Agnew. "It's about the
   voices of hundreds of thousands of people across the country that have
   been silenced for too long. Our generation's dreams have been deferred
   for too long. While the words spoken amidst the pillars of the Lincoln
   Memorial yesterday may have reverberated throughout the nation, the
   actions, energy and love of the rising generation will resound in
   history books for centuries to come, like those of giants before us."
