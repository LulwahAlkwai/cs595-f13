Mendeley and Elsevier - what does the future hold?

   Nearly three months has passed since the cloud-based research
   management and social collaboration platform, [20]Mendeley, joined
   Elsevier.

   With the ink on the contract now dry and the integration of the two
   companies in progress, we examine what has changed and outline some of
   the plans already underway to simplify the lives of researchers.

Taking the first steps

   When the acquisition was [21]announced back on April 9^th, we confirmed
   that Mendeley's senior management team would remain in place. In the
   days that followed, Mendeley co-founder, Victor Henning, spoke publicly
   about the rationale behind the deal. In an article on [22]Elsevier
   Connect, he explained that it just made "intuitive sense" to him. He
   said: "We started Mendeley to help researchers, and Elsevier lets us do
   that for a much larger community." He also highlighted some of the
   advantages for users - for example, thanks to the acquisition, Mendeley
   could immediately double user storage space free of charge.

   Since then, Henning has joined the Elsevier strategy team as a Vice
   President of Strategy, and is a regular visitor at the Elsevier
   Amsterdam office. In fact, he is planning to relocate there. He
   explained: "As the weeks have passed, I've become even more excited
   about the Mendeley-Elsevier partnership. While meeting many of my new
   colleagues, I have been offered a sneak peek at the initiatives
   underway at Elsevier designed to serve authors and researchers better.
   Many of these initiatives mirror ideas which we at Mendeley would have
   liked to pursue as well, but had to put off because we didn't have the
   resources - ideas around recommendation engines, text mining,
   interactive content, raw data, and open access.

   "Mendeley and Elsevier are serving the same audience - researchers
   around the globe - and are covering different parts of the scholarly
   workflow. Now that we are part of the Elsevier family, we have started
   to close the gaps in this workflow and make it more seamless. For
   example, as one of our first steps, we have already added support for
   all Elsevier journal citation styles, making it easier for authors to
   properly format their articles when submitting their work to Elsevier
   journals. And because we have shared these newly-generated citation
   styles with the open [23]CSL (Citation Style Language) repository, the
   styles are not just available to Mendeley users, but to users of other
   tools like [24]Zotero, [25]Papers, [26]BibSonomy, [27]Docear,
   [28]Qiqqa, and others."

   He added: "We are also examining how we can use Mendeley's
   recommendation technology to direct authors to the right journal,
   enable article submissions straight from Mendeley to the Elsevier
   Editorial System (EES), and integrate Mendeley's reading and annotation
   tools into the peer-review process. There are more ideas which I can't
   yet share, and it will take time to implement them - but they all have
   the potential to radically improve the author experience and make
   researchers' lives easier."

   Olivier Dumon, Managing Director of Academic and Government Markets for
   Elsevier (holding Lego sign) with Mendeley founders (left to right)
   Paul Föckler, Victor Henning, PhD, and Jan Reichelt.

Sharing a joint vision

   Olivier Dumon, Managing Director of Academic and Government Markets for
   Elsevier, is equally excited about the opportunities offered by the new
   partnership. Dumon led the team that worked on the Mendeley
   acquisition, and speaking after the deal was announced, he commented:
   "Sometimes business collaborations show so much potential they should
   just go all-in, and that was true in this case."

   According to Dumon, the acquisition allows Elsevier to build upon
   strong foundations in search and discovery by adding capabilities in
   document and citation management and sharing.

   He explained: "We have long known that researchers encounter a lot of
   pain points across their workflow - whether that's keeping up to date
   with other research or submitting research papers of their own.

   "While we can already help them with a number of these steps, we
   realized we wanted to improve our support for two of the most important
   ones - the sharing, collection and storage of data and the writing of
   papers.

   "Researchers use Mendeley for its document and reference management,
   collaboration, analytics and networking tools, and the Microsoft Word
   plug-in is a fantastic aid when it comes to writing."

   He added: "Elsevier also has a successful track record with indexing
   content from multiple publishers on researchers' behalves through tools
   such as [29]Scopus, [30]Scirus and [31]Reaxys®.*

   "By offering integration between Mendeley, Scopus and ScienceDirect, we
   can make this combined platform the central workflow and collaboration
   site for authors. In addition, we will be able to provide greater
   access to a growing repository of user-generated content while building
   tools that will enable researchers to search it more precisely."

   Dumon also believes the partnership will have a positive impact on
   areas such as [32]altmetrics, getting real-time information on hot
   articles across publishers based on Mendeley readership metrics. He
   said: "That will help librarians assess their collections and render
   all publishers' content more discoverable."

Victor Henning's guide to Mendeley

     Co-founders Jan Reichelt, Paul Föckler and I started Mendeley to
     solve our own problems. Back in 2007, we were PhD students with
     hundreds of academic papers stored on our computers and no good way
     to make sense of them. Existing reference management tools seemed
     too cumbersome, clunky, and expensive - they cost hundreds of Euros,
     required a lot of manual data entry, and wouldn't even store the
     metadata and the PDFs together!

     So we wondered: Why wasn't there a tool that could extract the
     relevant metadata - authors, title, year, journal, volume, issue
     etc. - automatically from PDFs, and help us manage the files? A tool
     that would also let us read and annotate PDFs, cite papers in Word,
     OpenOffice, or LaTeX, and allow us to set up collaborative groups
     for sharing and discussing research? In short, a tool for helping us
     with our entire workflow from content discovery, to document
     management, to authoring and collaboration? After realizing that
     such a tool did indeed not exist, we began to create it ourselves.

     Fast forward to 2013: Mendeley is now a global academic community.
     Collectively, our users have uploaded more than 400 million
     citations and documents into their Mendeley accounts. Our users'
     aggregated, anonymized metadata - available via the Mendeley API
     (application programming interface) - powers more than 300 new
     third-party research apps, e.g. document management on Android and
     Kindle, altmetrics apps like [33]ImpactStory.org and
     [34]Altmetric.com, and citation plugins for web and learning
     platforms like [35]WordPress, [36]Drupal, and [37]Moodle.

A few of your questions answered...

   Over the years, Henning's speaking engagements at publishing
   conferences have offered ample opportunity to chat with journal editors
   and publishers.  Here he answers some of the most common questions he
   has been asked.

   Q. Is Mendeley a peer-to-peer file sharing tool? Can academics just
   search and freely download any article they want?
   A. No, it isn't. Mendeley keeps each user's library private and
   accessible only by them. It is not possible to search for an article on
   Mendeley, see if another user has it in their document library, and
   download it from there. Instead, when Mendeley users search for or
   discover an article on Mendeley, we only show them the metadata - then
   link to the original publisher via DOI, or to the user's institutional
   library via OpenURL.

   As such, Mendeley is a major driver of traffic and article usage to
   publishers. Over the past few years, Mendeley had struck agreements
   with several major publishers and societies, e.g. Springer, IEEE, De
   Gruyter, and others, about providing us with metadata and document
   feeds to augment, clean, and complete our database, as cleaner and more
   complete data meant more traffic, usage, and altmetrics impact for
   publishers. Now, with Elsevier's support, we hope to grow our
   collaboration with other publishers to a much larger scale.

   Q. How does Mendeley treat self-archiving of articles and sharing for
   collaboration?
   A. There are only two ways in which articles can be shared on Mendeley:
   Via self-archiving articles on an author's Mendeley profile, or via
   Mendeley's 'Private Groups' functionality.

   Each Mendeley user has their own profile page - mine is here:
   [38]www.mendeley.com/profiles/victor-henning/. Users can upload their
   own papers to their profile to `self-archive' them and make them
   available for download on the web. It is entirely up to the user
   whether to opt into this functionality, and whether to upload only a
   metadata reference, a pre-print or post-print PDF, or a PDF of the
   final published version. We require our users to adhere to the
   copyright of their publisher when doing so, and the Mendeley user
   interface will incorporate explicit referrals to the [39]SHERPA-RoMEO
   policies of the publisher in the near future.

   The other way of sharing articles on Mendeley is via `Private Groups'.
   These are a collaboration space - much like Basecamp, SharePoint, or
   Google Docs - in which members of a team can keep track of references
   for a research project, collaboratively annotate documents, and discuss
   open questions. Private Groups are invisible from the outside, and are
   accessible by invitation-only. Free users of Mendeley are restricted to
   one Private Group, with a limit of three members including themselves;
   paid users of Mendeley can create groups of five up to 50 people, which
   are popular in labs and departments.

   Naturally, Elsevier reviewed our self-archiving and collaboration
   practices before deciding to acquire Mendeley - and concluded that we
   were providing a valuable workflow service to academics without
   undermining publishing business models and journal viability.

   Q. Is Mendeley pro-open access, or an open access-only tool?
   A. First and foremost, Mendeley is a workflow tool that wants to make
   researchers' lives easier, no matter whether they are working with OA
   or non-OA content.

   When a researcher discovers OA content on Mendeley, we are able to
   offer them a direct download into their Mendeley library, whereas we
   have to send them to other publishers' or library websites if they want
   to access non-OA content and we don't yet have an agreement with the
   publisher. Reaching such agreements is one potential benefit of working
   more closely with the rest of Elsevier.  Many members of the Mendeley
   staff and community team are personal believers in the OA movement and
   see it as the way forward for publishing because if all content were
   OA, then all content would flow without friction around the web and
   into/through researcher workflows.
