[34]Manage your Evernote Reminders with Remember The Milk

   Tuesday, May 28, 2013 by Emily Boyd

   Yes, the cow and the elephant are together at last! Evernote
   integration has been one of our most requested features, and since
   Evernote [35]launched Reminders last week, Bob T. Monkey has been
   furiously coding away. (The only time he surfaced over the weekend was
   when he ran out of bananas...)

   We're excited to announce that you can now automagically sync your
   Evernote Reminders with Remember The Milk. When you create Reminders in
   Evernote, they'll be added to your Remember The Milk account. You can
   edit and complete them in either Evernote or Remember The Milk, and
   we'll keep everything up-to-date!

   Evernote + Remember The Milk

Powerful task features for your Evernote Reminders

   The really cool thing about having your Evernote Reminders in Remember
   The Milk is all of the awesome extra features you can now use for your
   Reminders: you can give them priorities, time estimates, tags,
   locations, and URLs. Plus, you can make them repeat, too!

   You can also take advantage of powerful features like the ability to
   edit the properties for multiple tasks at once, options for sorting
   your lists, and the very cool [36]Smart Lists for showing tasks that
   meet your criteria.

Link with your Notes in Evernote

   Not only do your Evernote Reminders appear in Remember The Milk, but
   there's a handy Evernote icon on each one that opens the related
   Evernote Note. In our [37]web app, clicking the icon will pop up the
   Note:

   While in our [38]Android app, tapping the icon will take you straight
   to the Note in Evernote's Android app:

   What about iOS, you ask? Support for this feature in our [39]iPhone and
   [40]iPad apps is coming soon!

Take your Evernote Reminders everywhere

   Check out all the new places your Evernote Reminders can go! Not only
   can you manage your Evernote Reminders in our [41]web, [42]Android,
   [43]iPhone, [44]iPad, and [45]BlackBerry 10 apps, but you can now sync
   your Evernote Reminders with Microsoft Outlook via [46]MilkSync, and
   see your Reminders in [47]Gmail and [48]Google Calendar, too.

   Reminder methods

   Once your Evernote Reminders are in Remember The Milk, you can take
   advantage of the ridonculous number of reminder methods we support to
   get reminded about your Evernote Reminders (that sounds slightly
   meta...).

   You can get reminded by email, SMS, instant messenger (AIM, Gadu-Gadu,
   Google+ Hangouts (Google Talk), ICQ, Jabber (XMPP), Microsoft
   Messenger, Skype, and Yahoo! Messenger), [49]Twitter, desktop
   notifications, and notifications on [50]Android, [51]iPhone, [52]iPad,
   and [53]BlackBerry 10. Learn more about [54]setting up reminders.

Sound good?
