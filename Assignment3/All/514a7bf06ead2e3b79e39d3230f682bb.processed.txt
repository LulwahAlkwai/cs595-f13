A NY state of hardware

The next Hardware Innovation Workshop from Maker Media will be September 18
in NYC at the Hall of Science.

   This post was co-authored by Travis Good and Dale Dougherty

   Every major trend was once a fringe curiosity embraced by the few with
   a sense of mission. The current surge of hardware innovation is no
   exception. A relatively small group of makers are taking advantage of
   inexpensive embeddable technology and new, powerful tools that are
   making the physical world smarter by connecting it to digital
   computing. Add to that the open-source sharing of code and design
   files, and we're experiencing a new state of mind regarding hardware
   development. Rapid prototyping of new hardware ideas has never been
   easier or cheaper.

   As more people catch on, ideas and ambitions spread. We've seen
   makerspaces grow from only a handful to now approaching 1,000 in eight
   years. We've seen funding of new hardware products go from small, rare
   and obscure to large, frequent and regularly capturing the limelight.
   As the community of modern makers expands, a professional class has
   emerged with ambitions of taking products to market. In many cases,
   these "maker pros" are able to act on their own to develop their ideas,
   rather than needing the material resources of a larger company to get
   to market. However, the road to market is not an easy one, and
   transitioning from prototype to a shipped product is a challenging path
   often wrought with difficulties.

   New York has its own hardware development scene, reflected in the
   popularity of hardware startup Meetups, the NYC EDC's Next Top Makers
   competition, and the newly announced RGA Accelerator program for
   connected devices. New York City (in Queens) will also be the location
   for the next Hardware Innovation Workshop from Maker Media on September
   18 at New York's Hall of Science, just before World Maker Faire. We've
   had two editions of the Hardware Innovation Workshop in the SF Bay
   Area; this is the first time it will be held in New York. Here are some
   of the highlights from the jam-packed one-day program:
     * Peter Semmelhack, author of "Social Machines: How to Develop
       Connected Products that Change Customer's Lives" and founder of
       BugLabs, will be the keynote.
     * Bre Pettis, CEO of MakerBot, will talk about the new digitizer
       scanner in addition to the exciting developments of MakerBot 3D
       printers.
     * Christine Furstoss, global technology director of manufacturing &
       materials technologies at GE Global Research Center, will talk
       about the industrial use of 3D printers.
     * Carla Diana of Smart Interaction Labs will talk about interaction
       design.
     * Massimo Banzi of Arduino and Jason Kridner of BeagleBone will talk
       about new embedded controllers and processors.
     * Chris Dixon of Andreeson Horowitz will be one of several VCs
       talking about the hardware themes that interest them most.
     * Bunnie Huang, expert hacker and maker, will discuss manufacturing
       for makers.
     * Ben Einstein of Bolt, a maker accelerator, along with Scott Miller,
       CEO of Dragon Innovation and also of Bolt, will talk about getting
       to market.
     * Alasdair Allen of Data Sensing Labs will talk about sensor
       platforms.
     * Ayah Bdeir, founder and CEO of littleBits, will present a case
       study.
     * David Lang, author of newly published "Zero to Maker," will talk
       about learning enough making skills to be dangerous and about the
       OpenROV project.

   From Scobelizer's Robert Scoble to futurist Brian David Johnson, this
   event will cover the "state-of-the-art" in hardware innovation from
   many different perspectives. We'll have makers who have been pioneers
   in developing new products, but we'll also see up-and-coming product
   ideas in Pitches with Prototypes. Finally, the Hardware Innovation
   Workshop will conclude with an evening reception, where the 2013 winner
   of the Next Top Makers competition will be announced and the six
   finalists of the Pitch Your Prototype competition will display and demo
   their projects and ideas.

   Here's more information on the full program for the [22]Hardware
   Innovation Workshop. Here's information on [23]workshop registration.
