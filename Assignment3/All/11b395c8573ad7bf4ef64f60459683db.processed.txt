We are not the boss of natural selection. It is unpwnable.

   Posted by [9]Holly Dunsworth at [10]5:00 AM

                [11][take-no-prisoners-molly-hatchet-4.jpg]
              We came, we saw, we conquered natural selection.

   It should come as no surprise that I didn't actually speak to David
   Attenborough* recently. I'm just here writing about what I read about
   what he said about human evolution...

     "We stopped natural selection as soon as we started being able to
     rear 90-95% of our babies that are born. We are the only species to
     have put a halt to natural selection, of its own free will, as it
     were," he tells this week's Radio Times. [source: [12]The Guardian]

   I think a lot of these conversations come about because people like to
   ask people like David Attenborough (and even me!) what will happen to
   us in the future. And instead of saying that it's impossible to predict
   the future of evolution (because it depends on so many probabilistic,
   seemingly random, and maybe truly random events, big and small), many
   public intellectuals please the crowd by offering some kind of
   speculation. Often the questions are about whether we'll grow tails or
   larger brains; whether our brains will shrink because of computers;
   whether our wisdom teeth, pinky toes or appendix will completely
   disappear. And often the experts play along with tongue in cheek, or
   sometimes seriously, building future scenarios.
   The problem with Attenborough's answer--which might be aimed at
   avoiding this sort of speculation about the future--is that natural
   selection cannot possibly actually stop, not even at the hands, the
   hearts, the minds of humans. We're pretty amazing, but not that
   amazing.

           Jeepers. What are we even looking at here? ([14]source)

   To start, natural selection doesn't just enable the most obvious,
   visible, awesome changes to our bodies over time.  To be sure, natural
   selection explains adaptations of all sorts--from fur to feather,
   prehensile tail to flagellum, macro to micro. (Ahem... as long as we're
   sure whether what we're covered with, dangling from or whipping around
   is actually an adaptation.)
   But natural selection also explains how we are here, alive and working
   well enough to be here, alive. In that sense, in its purifying sense,
   natural selection's at work, if you will, on practically everything
   about us and on practically everything about everything else that's
   alive now or that's ever been alive. Natural selection is always
   happening. Always. Culture or no culture... and because of culture!
   Furthermore, even if we could consider all environments (and our
   cultural abilities to adapt to them) to be equal and constant, there
   will always be both new combinations of old genes and new mutations in
   each and every person (100+ brand new base changes to each person's
   code compared to mom and dad)--some of which will cause human lives to
   end before they've passed on those combinations and those new
   mutations.
   That each of us is unique, demonstrates that evolution is always
   occurring even though scientists prefer to think of it as change over
   time at the population level. Regardless, and this is very important,
   natural selection allows for most of this perpetual change in lineages
   and in populations, which is why so much life on the planet is humming
   and thrumming away, and has for the last 4 billion years.

   However, any genetic-based infertility, any genetic condition that
   directly or indirectly inhibits procreation, or any genetic disorder or
   disease that ends a person's life before they pass it on will disappear
   due to natural selection, along with their entire genome, including
   everything that had little to do with early death or infertility. So
   regardless of medicine and birth control, there will always be lineages
   that are more prolific than others (i.e. differential reproductive
   success) and there will always be lineages that disappear--both due to
   constant natural selection. The same is true about differential
   reproduction due to constant genetic drift--that is, chance change in a
   gene or trait's frequency over time or differences in a gene or trait's
   frequency between populations due to chance differential reproduction
   and other evolutionary processes occurring differently in those
   populations. Like selection, drift is always occurring, but it can
   escalate in intensity, for example, after a tsunami.

   So, it may be true that, generally speaking, humans today have more
   egalitarian reproductive "success" compared to our ancestors who were
   arguably more vulnerable to nature red in tooth and claw.
   And it may be true that the odds are greater for any one human to
   produce offspring that go on to bear their own offspring than for an
   individual in another, and maybe many many other, species--those that
   are, arguably, more vulnerable to nature red in tooth and claw.
   And it may be true that because we birth relatively few
   offspring--compared to, for example, octopuses that bear thousands and
   thousands at once--that there's not a whole lot of difference between
   Alex's fitness, having 3 kids and 3 grandkids, versus Alice's having 3
   kids and 2 grandkids.
   And furthermore, it may be true that compared to innumerable species,
   we have more lineage continuance and less lineage extinction due to
   fewer juvenile deaths per birth thanks to opposable thumbs, throwing
   ability, weapons, medicine, extended family, extended love, extended
   memory, food storage, food production, cooking, sanitation, and so much
   more that contributes to or falls under the "culture" umbrella.
   Classic examples of recent and potentially currently occurring natural
   selection that people call on in discussions like this are lactose
   tolerance and malaria resistance. Both are usually used to argue that
   natural selection has not stopped. But leaning on them can give the
   impression that we know of only two ways humans are presently adapting.
   There are others, like amylase and immune system genes, which are
   potentially powerful too, but again, examples of human biological
   adaptation in present or near-present times are not exactly
   overwhelming us. No matter! Because there are, unfortunately, myriad
   mutations (individually rare, but not so rare in total), both de novo
   and inherited, that are selected against every day, all around us, too
   numerous to list. This is natural selection.
   So it's just wrong to say that natural selection has stopped unless to
   "stop" is a relative term. And even then, saying natural selection has
   relatively stopped or has effectively stopped in humans is making an
   assumption about what's good for humanity (that will sadly never
   evolve) and what's bad (that we're so busy propagating). It's also
   making an assumption about the relative strength of selection for
   forming adaptations out there in the "wild"--one that isn't grounded in
   firm understanding or consensus among many thoughtful scientists.
   [18][ORCHID.jpg]
   If we're going to consider natural selection to be so strong an
   evolutionary mechanism, then we have to consider mutation and genetic
   drift to have the potential to be just as strong--depending on the
   snapshot in time/space/organism and there have been many of these
   snapshots, to put it mildly. Further, to ignore the potential for gene
   flow to spread and to create new combinations of genes with potential
   to create new phenotypes that fail or flourish (i.e. under natural
   selection and/or genetic drift) in different circumstances is to lack
   an imagination--and a guttery one at that.
   And these assumptions about selection's great strength relative to
   other mechanisms of evolution illustrate our biases and fashions, as
   well as the limits of our observations, our methods, and Science. These
   major issues in evolutionary biology are real and they're certainly not
   respected by statements like " We stopped natural selection." For a
   public that often mistakenly equates evolution with natural selection,
   it's just reinforcement. And, no, evolutionary understanding isn't just
   about being academically correct; many of us strongly believe that how
   we understand or misunderstand evolution affects how we think about
   social inequality, race, other organisms, caring for the environment,
   etc and, therefore, how we behave regarding those issues.
   I've written a few posts that speak to the importance of evolutionary
   understanding, like:
     * [19]Evolution is the only natural explanation. And it's all we
       need.
     * [20]The F-words of Evolution
     * [21]Another F-word of Evolution
     * [22]Evolution's got a P.R. problem
     * [23]Taking our (lovely lady) lumps
     * [24]Luck of the draw
     * [25]Please make us teach creationism

   And, granted, Attenborough admits he's privileged so this isn't a
   comment aimed at him, but. ... Isn't it just a bit soon to be including
   the entire human species in such a healthy, well-nourished, low youth
   mortality, long life expectancy state of nature that has "stopped
   natural selection" on ourselves? I think we have a long way to go
   before such a definition of humanity can be granted to all of us. And
   even if or when we, as a whole, achieve such a comfy state, we still
   won't be able to say that natural selection has stopped for the reasons
   I discussed above, and for others that I didn't.
   What's more, if we did achieve the kind of wizardrous skills that deem
   us impervious to natural selection, it couldn't have occurred until
   recently. So it's probably a bit premature, based on our limited
   observation, to conclude that's where our species is.
   I'm right there with Attenborough in sharing his astonishment at how we
   affect our own evolution, and that of other species, in ways that might
   not have unfolded if our cognition and culture had not evolved first.
   In fact, I think it's so fascinating that [26]I'm writing a book about
   it right now. But if we claim that human cognition and culture have
   ended natural selection, we're denying our place in a universe that we
   cannot completely control. We are not immune to effects of the world
   around us, no matter how masterful we are at manipulating it. Climate,
   weather, geological processes, disasters, infectious diseases,
   parasites, symbionts (we're full of 'em and covered in 'em!)... these
   are just some of the things that affect our evolution through natural
   selection (and other means) as well as all the evolution of the species
   we depend on for food and all the species besides us that our food
   depends on. Evolution that's occurring just as constantly in everything
   around us and on us and inside us as it is in our own
   genomes will directly and indirectly affect our future evolution.
   There are few blanket rules in biology but here's two: Evolution of an
   organism is always happening and always will. Evolution in one organism
   is affected by evolution in another.

   So, sure! I can speculate about our future just like anyone else.
   Here's how natural selection will affect human evolution at some point
   in the future. It's not so much a tale of our interconnectedness with
   other species as a tale of our interconnectedness with the planet.
   Everyone knows that heat is bad for sperm production. It's possible
   that the earth will eventually get so hot (thanks to our cognition and
   culture???) that sperm production ceases in many men living in the
   hottest parts of Earth and that it only persists in the men who live in
   cooler regions and in the men with mutations for overcoming the
   obstacle. As a result, we'll lose lineages evolving in the tropics and
   maybe all lineages. And if the warming occurs quickly and uniformly,
   and if there are no mutants already alive who can make sperm in the
   heat, global warming will certainly cause human extinction. There. See
   how easy it is to speculate about future human evolution? You can't
   prove me wrong.
   And, like our speculation about the evolutionary future, many of our
   hypotheses for the evolutionary past are nearly as unpwnable as natural
   selection and evolution are.

   Thanks to Barbara J. King for sparking me to think about these things.
   Her reflection, including some of my input, is up [29]on her blog at
   NPR.
   *I don't know him, but like many of you, I have admiration and maybe
   even a little (or a lot of) affection for David Attenborough. So this
   isn't about reacting to a popularizer of science, as a person. These
   are just my thoughts about something he said about how evolution works.
   This isn't about Attenborough, it's about us.

       This is a great, cogent, and clear statement and reply to the kind
       of simplicity so often found on television by the 'experts'.
       Humans have always controlled our evolution by social life, tool
       use, and so on, and we still affect it, but of course, as you say,
       in our own way.
       Evolution is not all about survival, but at least as much about
       reproduction, and indeed there is more 'room' for selection by
       differential fertility these days than by differential mortality
       (that's been known for a very long time--it was a major aspect of
       my dissertation decades ago,and I didn't invent the idea). There is
       no reason to assume that differential fertility isn't still a
       substantial factor in our evolution.
       A huge population usually evolves more slowly than small local
       ones, so we may have slowed down...until the next epidemic?
       The media need simple stories. Dumbing down sells, and even the
       public 'experts' seem to get brain-numbed by doing this.
       Maybe what the media needs are people like you, Holly, who can tell
       a more accurate story and still make it readable, understandable,
       and even enjoyable!

            It was truth, not flattery.
            Actually, as some of your images suggested, if we were living
            in the past, we would probably have similar ideas: any
            'present' will seem static, adaptive, and perfect.
            Homo erectus would look at themselves and say the past had led
            them to rise to their wonderful state.
            Chimps might feel proud of their accomplishments, too. And
            think of how fish, so remarkably skilled, might feel!

            "If we were living in the past, we would probably have similar
            ideas: any 'present' will seem static, adaptive, and perfect."
            That is an important concept that I fail to explain to most
            people including scientists. Someone living during the
            discovery of printing press (or sword or steam engine) was as
            fascinated and overwhelmed with new technology as we are
            today. So, to think of ourselves as superior or more creative
            than people inhabiting the world in the past is preposterous.
            Then the question arises to Attenborough's remark - did human
            evolution stop in 1st century, 14th century, 19th century, or
            only today?

            The problem now as ever is the usual glacial slowness of
            evolution. Actually, Lamarck was the first major figure to
            recognize this and try to explain how it could ultimately
            yield major change.
            For many reasons, scientists can be as blind to the obvious as
            anybody else!

       Strangely, the comment struck me more as a devil's advocate kind of
       statement: "If Natural Selection is the way organisms evolve, and
       the vast majority of our offspring are living to breed, then those
       competitive life-or-death means with which evolution selects traits
       are void." Simplistic, yes, but it strikes a note that Darwinism,
       as Darwin envisioned it, is not the same as "evolution" we know
       today. I have a hard time believing that EVERY maintained trait or
       groups of traits give inevitable advantage. How could that be? We
       as humans love to interpret every single trait in some beneficial
       sense. We've all seen it: some psychologist trying to explain why
       such-and-such detrimental behavior was somehow useful in more
       primitive situations, etc. But sometimes, I think things just
       happen because they happen or they are simply more probable.
       Otherwise, this evolution thing is far too eerily reminiscent of a
       clock maker determining each minute detail.

            I'd say first that even 95% infant survival leaves some room
            for selection. Second, although slow, chance (genetic drift)
            will still be operating. This would apply to your comment
            about 'every' maintained trait: indeed, because most traits
            are polygenic, the trait could be maintained but there would
            be evolution in its underlying genetic basis.
            Your idea about how we want to find a value-basis for every
            trait is nearly the same as a religious determinism, because
            it assumes selection is as all-seeing as a God would be, which
            is just manifestly false....as your clock maker reference
            indicates.
            This just happen is another way to say genetic drift.
            I would also say that we want to be able to 'explain'
            everything and that verges on saying that everything must have
            some reason, purpose, or meaning.

            what you commented is a reaction to my post. When I say that
            nearly everything is experiencing selection that's coming from
            a p.o.v. that it's nearly impossible to know otherwise.

       I wonder if Attenborough was thinking of that paper in Human
       Biology that analyzed birthweight and survival in Italy and found a
       near absence of stabilizing and directional selection? But I also
       recall reading that the variance in birthweight increases
       (something that selection can act on) when infants are born to
       older mothers (something that is a relatively modern phenomenon).
       So there will always be variance birthweight due to a variety of
       factors such as maternal age, etc., no matter how much we
       technologically try to shape how much of that variance is available
       to selection.
       But you also hint at an important point: how much of differential
       reproductive success can we actually attribute to natural selection
       versus "random reproduction." There are a few recent demographic
       papers that attempt to develop null models of random reproduction,
       such that one can compare the expectation of random reproduction
       with actual patterns of reproduction in order to help us determine
       the role of natural selection versus other factors.
       And here's some pointless trivia: Many Molly Hatchet album covers
       were designed by Frank Frazetta. Frank's cousin is Tom Frazzetta,
       who wrote one of the first books on Evo-Devo, back in 1975: Complex
       Adaptations in Evolving Populations. This book was among the first
       to merge population dynamics, development, and adaptation and it
       talked about things like "integration" and "quasi-independence"
       long before their current popularity.

       I'm particularly fascinated by the evolution of innate human
       psychological traits, such as violence, intelligence, lust,
       cunning, religiosity and so on.
       The direction in which these may evolve will be determined,
       presumably, by any future changes in our social environment.

            I would argue that the genetic basis for these traits are not
            human-specific. Instead, I think our ability for symbolic
            language and thinking--for culture--leads to expression of
            these of our mental abilities in a context-dependent way.

            Yes, I agree. With the exception of religiosity, all these
            psychological traits are applicable to many non-human species
            as well as to humans. In that sense, they are surely genetic
            rather than cultural in origin.
            The degree to which they are 'encouraged' or 'discouraged'
            will be determined by the social environment. Over a
            sufficiently long period of time, they will be subjected to
            the forces of natural selection.
            Presumably, it is entirely possible for chimpanzees or
            dolphins to evolve much greater degrees of intelligence and
            self-awareness and, eventually, even a degree of religiosity.
            This would create problems for human religious institutions
            (whatever they may look like in 100,000 years' time!).

            I'll happily talk about the genetics of "religiosity" when
            there's a gene identified ... and one that's not also
            explained just as well by its involvement in language and
            memory (and imagination if you think of it as memories of the
            future). Until then, I think it's premature, among other
            things, to talk about religious beliefs as if they require a
            special evolutionary, let alone genetic, explanation.

            Hello Holly.
            Thank you for your reply.
            The inability of current technology to identify specific genes
            for religiosity does not, of course, negate the existence of
            them!
            Genes for love, anger or lust cannot yet be identified, but
            most scientists would agree that these human psychological
            traits are innate and genetic - rather than cultural - in
            origin.
            This logic is based upon the universality of these traits
            throughout all human societies. Religiosity has a similar
            degree of universality. Of course, individuals vary enormously
            in the degree to which they exhibit love, anger, lust and
            religiosity. However, it would be absurd for an individual
            with little or no anger to claim that anger is not an innate
            genetic trait in humans, or that it is cultural in origin.

       how can natural selection explain a new biologic system like motion
       system? even we as intellegent designer can make a system like this
       in a small steps. so how can evolution can do this?
       i read a paper thatsaid that even for one protein we need 10*60
       mutations. is a lot!:

            It is always possible that there are fundamental aspects of
            life that have not yet been discovered. We can never be
            sure--this science, after all, and we have to find out about
            Nature (there are no 'sacred' texts that explain it perfectly
            for us).
            But based on what we know, the issue (I think) is largely in
            numbers we just can't really understand. Life (and its
            proteins) have been evolving for well over 3 billion years.
            The number of organisms is millions or more for each species,
            at any given time, and species exist for millions of years.
            Not all possible mutations have arisen, perhaps, but there is
            usually not just one mutation that could enable something new
            to happen. There are millions of them. Chance and natural
            selection lead whatever works to proliferate. Of all the
            things that might have happened, which are essentially
            countless, what we see today (and what, as animals we
            ourselves are), is the array of those molecular mechanisms
            that passed through those screens.
            That is the best theoretical understanding we have today. It
            has shown very high predictive power. That's why we accept
            evolutionary theory as generally true, even if we know that
            there are many aspects we do not yet understand.

            ok. lets check this. for a one small protein of 100 amino acid
            there is 20^100 possible sequences. how many of them are
            functional? like the number of the atom in the
            universe?(somthing like 10^70) is nothing compare to the
            entire possiblle combinations. so again- its a huge problem to
            the evolution. even for 10^30 mutations in a complex animal
            like mammals we need bilions of year. not milions.and natural
            selection doesnt help because there is no function until the
            all 100 amino acid in the place.

            This kind of argument has been raised by a stream of other
            creationists, and has been answered just as many times by
            science with cogent materialistic as opposed to mystic

       Very interesting piece. I'm a great admirer of Attenborough, but I
       disagree with him on this. Steve Jones also made the same point a
       few years ago, though I have not heard him argue it more recently.
       I do think it is naive to assume that, just because we have
       effectively conquered infant mortality (although not our low
       fecundity) in the developed world, that this rules out selection in
       other aspects or even for the rest of the world. It's interesting
       to think that, as our mobility increases and our effective
       population size increases, that selection is likely to become a
       more powerful force than drift.

            Ed,
            I think it's all much more subtle than this, and involves
            subjective ideas about what 'evolution' is, ideas that are
            inherently hyper-selectionistic. Every new person inherits
            about 150 new mutations in 'single-copy' DNA and countless
            more in repeat regions of various types. These and all
            existing variants (about 1 per 100 base pairs even in a small
            sample of people) change frequency every generation. That's
            evolution, and if anything there's more total genomic flux
            than every before (since our population is greater).
            So maybe the Attenborough's (and Steve Jones's) of the world,
            who are glib varnishers of what evolution is about, are just
            referring to complex traits that are affected by natural
            selection. But, as you note, there's no reason at all to say
            those won't change, even if (unless due to horrific trauma)
            will take longer because our population is so huge.
            And 5% infant mortality is not trivial if prenatal traits or
            traits related to fertility are affected by genetic variation.
            And if traits in the living affect their ability to find mates
            or reproduce, neither the infant mortality nor the long life
            expectancy figures that are tossed so facilely around, have
            anything relevance to how much evolution could occur in such
            traits.

       Holly, I have a serious question.
       I don't think Attenborough was really saying that natural selection
       had stopped working so much as he meant that contemporary humans
       were outwitting it to the extent that we could say that humans were
       no longer evolving. That is, there will still be genetic change
       like mutation and genetic drift (as you say). But as a species as a
       whole, we're not under the kind of selection pressure that we were
       in past centuries and past millennia.
       I guess one of the most recent adaptive changes among humans is
       that natural selection made northern communities lighter skinned to
       help with vitamin D production from sunlight, but made equatorial
       communities darker skinned to help protect from skin cancer. But
       given all the migration that happened in modernity - that is,
       roughly, the last 500 years - there are now lots of light skinned
       people in equatorial places and dark skinned people in northern
       places. Natural selection is unlikely to weed these people out
       because of increased clothing, indoor jobs, sunscreen, and cancer
       fighting technology (for the light skinned folks) and vitamin D
       supplements and vitamin D rich foods in supermarkets (for the dark
       skinned folks). In that sense, it's not that natural selection has
       stopped operating as that human culture has generally outwitted the
       selection pressure that otherwise would have prevented the people
       whose ancestors have migrated from passing on their genetic
       heritage to future generations.
       I'm not a scientist and I have only a lay understanding of
       evolution. I see your point about the danger of thinking we now
       control the process - as you point out, catastrophic events like
       global warming could quickly cause selection pressure to pick up.
       But isn't the key here natural selection?
       In the Evolution textbook by Nicholas H. Barton, et. al. (Cold
       Spring Harbor, NY: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2007), they
       write that natural selection is "the most important evolutionary
       process" because it "is the only process that leads to adaptation"
       (458, 457). They continue: "Although many processes shape
       evolution, natural selection is special because it alone creates
       complex, functioning organisms. All other processes tend to degrade
       what has been built up by natural selection, simply because these
       processes act at random with respect to function. Mutation makes
       random changes in DNA sequence that, if they have any effect at
       all, tend to disrupt function. Migration introduces genes from
       elsewhere, which tend not to be adapted to their new environment.
       Similarly, recombination and random drift will, on average, disrupt
       genotype frequencies that have been built up by selection so as to
       increase fitness" (463).
       I'm not sure what exactly Attenborough meant to say, but isn't it
       correct to understand that the most important evolutionary process
       of natural selection is currently and widely being thwarted by
       human culture and technology?

            Sorry if I seem grumpy but given the exposure this essay's
            received on io9, by now I'm feeling pretty awkward about all
            the talk of Attenborough (I never wanted to make this personal
            or about mind-reading) and I'm also pretty tired of arguing
            over points I've already made (I guess poorly) in my essay and
            the links I've provided in it. There are a couple paragraphs
            in that essay about how one could describe natural selection
            being slower or weaker in us, especially now, than in the past
            so... sure! The point is to say it stopped is wrong and has
            negative ramifications for how we continue to misunderstand
            evolutionary processes and assume evolutionary knowledge.
            That's what I was trying to get across up there. I'll keep
            trying to do better at it with writings to come.

            I've stayed mostly out of this long set of exchanges, because
            this was Holly's post and she wrote it very well and (I think)
            clearly and correctly.
            Too many people, including those in various life sciences not
            to mention the media, have very confused ideas about what
            'evolution' means--as a word or concept to them, and as its
            scientific reality.
            Not only is there the tendency to view the discussions in
            terms of Disneyfied concepts of evolution, conceptually
            transforming thousands of generations' worth of creepingly
            slow change to a speeded-up thrilling melodrama. It makes
            could imagery, good TV, and it's easy to think that way.
            Even if it were true that we're evolving very slowly--and that
            is debatable and depends on what one means by 'evolving' and
            'slowly'--we have no way to know what might come along in the
            future.
            One might say that future evolution, say, to change things so
            we could see better in the dark or do calculus faster, or
            develop more functionally powerful big toes, would take
            forever so even were that to happen we're not really evolving
            the way we used to and the way other species do.
            But such changes usually take thousands of generations, and
            are basically imperceptible at any given time. It is this
            slowness that perhaps more than anything now, or were we to
            observe it in the past, that makes adaptive evolution seem so
            perpelxing--easy to invoke, hard to prove in specific
            individual cases. Easy to demonstrate in terms of patterns of
            genomic variation, but then rather abstract in terms of what
            the genes are doing and why they evolved.

            Yes, and maybe it's time to close this discussion. In any
            case, grasping these aspects of evolution is harder than
            catching an oiled eel, and seems to have been elusive for the

            At least one final thought for people who are reading this far
            before we do leave it be...
            For us to have a present to bias and even trick us into seeing
            perfection everywhere (especially in ourselves, but also in
            long nectar-licking bat tongues, e.g.) requires that past
            conditions were just as adaptive, just as perfect at any given
            snapshot of observation! And there were innumerable and still
            are. Now, with that in mind, let's try to make sense of
            natural selection as more than the fairy tale (grim or whim)
            that we've been fed and instead as something much more
            complex, nuanced, and maybe sometimes extreme, but also often
            subtle and certainly not necessarily "the" "most" "important"
            process in evolution as if it can stand alone and all-mighty
            without others (which it requires like mutation) that lend
            themselves to non-selective evolutionary processes too.

            I'm sorry I framed my questions in terms of Attenborough whom
            I really don't know much about. And anyway, like you say,
            there's no point in trying to guess what was on his mind.
            I didn't realize that natural selection was no longer seen by
            all as the cornerstone of evolution. I'm not a scientist at
            all and have only read some books, but am keenly interested.
            My questions were honest because I had been having a similar
            conversation about whether evolution was still occurring when
            Attenborough made his comment and you wrote your essay. I
            realize with the older example of lactose tolerance and the
            newer one of amylase that these are examples of recent
            evolution. But both these examples are thousands of years old
            at least, so they can't really function as examples of
            evolution still occurring today, within the modernity that has
            taken shape in the last 500 years or so.
            I take Ken's point that evolution occurs very slowly and would
            be imperceptible to the present. I don't mean to be
            disputatious - like I said, I'm interested but untutored in
            the science of evolution. But it's difficult for me to imagine
            a scenario in which the ability to do calculus faster or to
            see in the dark better gives a survival and reproductive
            advantage to those who have such genes - at least under
            current modern conditions. Of course, a global catastrophe
            could change that - global warming leading to increased cloud
            cover and global darkness, wherein the ability to see in the
            dark does confer an advantage? But under those conditions (of
            no sunlight) we all would have much bigger problems. (As
            Cormac McCarthy's The Road suggests.)
            As you can see from my counter-story, I am stuck in a rut in
            terms of thinking that natural selection is the key. Can you
            recommend a book or books that, contra to the evolution
            textbook I mentioned, puts natural selection in its place, as
            it were, among the other evolutionary processes?

            My and Anne's book The Mermaid's Tale should still be in
            print. We discuss these things,of course, since we care a lot
            about them. I would say books by Richard Lewontin (e.g., It
            Ain't Necessarily So, or The Triple Helix) do that. Michael
            Lynch has a paper in PNAS about 2007 or a book of about that
            time (The Origins of Genome Architecture), or Masatosh Nei's
            new book (Mutation-driven Evolution). Of these, Nei and Lynch
            are more technical.
            There are countless other places for similar views, that are
            not just propaganda for the view. Articles and books at all
            levels. The point is not that selection doesn't occur, nor
            that it's unimportant, but that there is (we think) too
            widespread a view of its precision and ubiquity, not just as
            something always possible but something always the major

Comments

   We always welcome comments. You can comment anonymously if you choose,
   but be aware that anonymous comments go straight to the black hole of
   spam because that's what they almost always are, and we only
   occasionally look at them. Better to use your name, or some modicum
   thereof if you want your comment to be published. We do moderate
   comments, so they won't appear on the blog until one of us publishes
   it, but we try to do that in a timely way. Sorry about the captcha, by
   the way. But it has reduced the spam coming in to zero.
