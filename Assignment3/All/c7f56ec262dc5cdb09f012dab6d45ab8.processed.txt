Science fiction novels for economists

   Author: [5]Noah Smith
   Diane Coyle has a blog post called "Classics for economists," and
   someone on Twitter requested that I do a companion piece called
   "Science fiction for economists", so here it is.
   Really, most science fiction is about economics. What makes most future
   visions interesting is not just the technical particulars of the cool
   new Stuff, but the social ramifications. Here are some of the sci-fi
   books that I thought dealt with important economic issues in the most
   insightful and interesting ways. I also chose only books that I think
   are well-written, with well-conceived characters, engaging plots, and
   skillful writing.
   1. [6]A Deepness in the Sky, by Vernor Vinge
   [adits.jpg]
   In addition to being quite possibly the best science fiction novel I've
   ever read, Deepness is also a great meditation on public economics.
   When Vernor Vinge became famous in the 80s, he was a hard-core
   libertarian - his novel [7]The Peace War, and its sequel short story
   "The Ungoverned", are like a Real Business Cycle model come to life,
   with lone-wolf genius engineers teaming up with private police forces
   to bring down a fascist technocratic government made up of...university
   administrators. Ha. But by the 90s, Vinge's views on government and
   markets had become markedly more nuanced - in the swashbuckling space
   opera [8]A Fire Upon the Deep, we see private security forces failing
   miserably when faced with a powerful external threat (in fact, that
   book made me think of the "[9]Tamerlane Principle"). Security, Vinge
   realizes, is a public good.
   In Deepness, Vinge adds another public good: Research. The narrative of
   Deepness is split between a race of spider-people with roughly
   20th-century technology, and a spacefaring guild of human merchants
   called the Qeng Ho. On the spider world, the protagonist is a brilliant
   scientist named Sherkaner Underhill, who is basically a Von Neumann or
   Feynman type. Sherkaner is the ultimate lone genius, but he ends up
   needing the government to fund his research. In space, meanwhile, the
   heroic merchant entrepreneur Pham Nuwen (who is a recurring protagonist
   in Vinge novels) struggles to decide whether he should turn his
   merchant fleet into an interstellar government. Governments, he finds,
   are good at producing really new scientific breakthroughs, but
   eventually they become unwieldy and stifle the economy and society,
   then collapse under their own institutional weight. The very very end
   of the book is - or at least, seemed to me to be - a metaphor for the
   Great Stagnation and the death (and future rebirth) of Big Science.
   2. [10]Makers, by Cory Doctorow
   Cory Doctorow is known both for his science fiction and for being the
   creator of the blog [11]Boing Boing, one of the oldest and best blogs
   on the internet. In Makers, Doctorow dishes up a near future that is
   almost spooky in its prophetic vision. The book is all about economics,
   the death of corporations, the rise of freelance and temp economies,
   the death of old media and the rise of blogs, and the disruptive impact
   of technology on people's jobs. It envisions the rise of 3D printing,
   the startup craze (and the startup glut), and the use of intellectual
   property as corporations' weapon of choice to fight back against
   progress. It's incredibly well-written, but also extremely sad, just to
   warn you.
   3. [12]The Dispossessed, by Ursula K. LeGuin
   [51MFm3w72TL.jpg]
   It's incredibly hard to imagine a world without private property, but
   LeGuin pulls it off. Spoilers: A world without property is pretty
   boring and fairly poor. But LeGuin also shows us another world, much
   like our own, where the anti-property anarcho-syndicalist movement was
   suppressed and tamed, much like Marxism was suppressed and tamed here
   on Earth. What's interesting is that although anarcho-syndicalism
   doesn't work incredibly well on the world where it's implemented, the
   anarcho-syndicalist idea and movement serve as a sort of permanent
   opposition force on the capitalist world. When [13]I read Robert M.
   Buckley writing that Marxism has fulfilled a similar role in the West
   here on Earth, I immediately thought of The Dispossessed.
   4. [14]Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, by Cory Doctorow
   Doctorow again. In this book, he examines what a true post-scarcity
   society would look like. Spoiler: It looks a lot like a bunch of
   sarcastic bohemian Canadian people. But basically, I think that's
   probably what the future will look like, at least if we're lucky.
   Anyway, this book is notable for the concept of "whuffie", an online
   currency based on peer approval, which arguably inspired Facebook's
   "like" button.
   5. [15]Rainbows End, by Vernor Vinge
   Vinge again. Rainbows End is a sad, thoughtful novel about old age and
   obsolescence (notice that there is no apostrophe in the title). But
   it's also one of the most visionary novels about future labor markets.
   In an interconnected world in which skills never stay fresh for long
   and most value is created through entertainment, old engineers have to
   go back to high school, and new corporations are started by teenagers
   collaborating online with strangers halfway around the world. Rainbows
   End is also famous for envisioning the technology of Augmented Reality;
   this novel probably inspired Google Glass. Interestingly, Vinge
   continues his evolution toward a balanced view of public goods, adding
   education to the list of things that government needs to provide.
   (Update: In an email, Vinge points out that he never specified that the
   high school in Rainbows End was government-funded! Touche!)
   6. [16]Accelerando, by Charles Stross
   [aclg.jpg]
   Charles Stross, another [17]noted blogger, loves to play with ideas,
   even if he doesn't believe in them. In Accelerando, he mainly plays
   with the idea of the Singularity, but he also plays with a bunch of
   far-out funky future economics. In one part, the main character,
   impresario and wandering entrepreneur Manfred Macx, uses advanced
   computer algorithms to successfully implement an optimal centrally
   planned economy, by predicting what humans will want before they even
   know they want it. Macx's various disruptive innovations inevitably
   draw the ire of the law, and he creates a protective cloud of AI
   lawyers to wage constant "lawfare" against governments and corporations
   alike. In another part of the book, the entire solar system is taken
   over by sentient High-Frequency Trading algorithms. But I haven't
   really spoiled the book for you, since these are only about 0.1% of the
   ideas contained within. Note: Stross has also written a series called
   the [18]Merchant Princes series that deals even more with economics,
   but I haven't read it.
   7. [19]Lucifer's Hammer, by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle
   [51A1b0iz%2BjL.jpg]
   Lucifer's Hammer is a story about a comet hitting Earth, and the
   aftermath. It's notable for its quaint Reaganite conservative politics
   (it came out in 1977), and does make a couple of glaring economic
   mistakes (for example, a guy trying to build a nuclear power plant is
   an independent wildcatting entrepreneur instead of a giant
   government-backed corporation). But it makes up for that with its
   excellent portrayal of what the economy would be like in the immediate
   aftermath of an abrupt civilizational collapse. Hint: Farming,
   containment of contagious diseases, de-specialization of labor, and
   collective security become very very important.
   8. [20]The Windup Girl, by Paolo Bacigalupi
   [6597651.jpg]
   Brutally dark and hopeless, The Windup Girl is a book about peak oil,
   global civilizational decline, and the (temporary) end of positive-sum
   economies. In a suddenly overpopulated world, humans are forced into a
   constant Hobbesian zero-sum game, and most moral norms go right out the
   window. Warning: This is very tough book to read. But it serves as an
   important reminder of the Malthusian menace that forever lurks just
   outside the circle of light provided by the flickering candle-flame of
   modern technology.
   9. [21]The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, by Robert Heinlein
   [410BnoLMnoL.jpg]
   Actually a mythic retelling of the American Revolution, The Moon is a
   Harsh Mistress contains some very interesting thoughts on colonialism
   and the Resource Curse. Unsurprisingly, terrorism is used as a way to
   make resource colonialism too expensive for the occupying power.
   Unfortunately, we don't get to see the political struggles and despotic
   regimes that probably arose in the aftermath of lunar independence. But
   Heinlein also does use the book to play with some interesting
   libertarian ideas, like a privatized court system.
   10. [22]Schismatrix, by Bruce Sterling
   [2095-1.jpg]
   Simply one of the most wide-ranging and visionary science fiction
   novels ever written. Bruce Sterling is like an eternally erupting
   quasar of creativity, and this is his finest book. None of the
   economics here makes any sense - or, more accurately, it all takes
   place in such a funky, crazy future world that it's impossible to know
   if it makes any sense.
   11. [23]Permutation City, by Greg Egan
   [permutation-city.jpg]
   If there's any sci-fi novel that beats Schismatrix for far-out
   blow-your-brain-out-the-back-of-your-skull vision, it's Permutation
   City. If I hadn't already had the idea for [24]D-Mod, this book
   (written over a decade before I thought of the concept) would have
   given it to me fully formed. Permutation City is about the ultimate
   nature and purpose of human consciousness and experience, and yet it
   has implications for technologies that are being developed right now,
   as we speak.
   12. [25]Reamde, by Neal Stephenson
   [reamde.jpg]
   Most people would recommend Stephenson's Snow Crash or Cryptonomicon,
   but for economics I like Reamde the best. Although not technically
   sci-fi, it has that flavor. The hero is an aging tech entrepreneur who
   owns a game that's a combination of World of Warcraft and Bitcoin (yes,
   this book predicts Bitcoin). It also deals with the economic incentives
   of the Russian mob, the challenges facing smart young tech workers in
   China and Hungary, and lots of other cool features of today's global
   economy. It's not Stephenson's #1 awesomest book, though; that would be
   [26]Anathem.
   13. [27]The Game of Thrones series, by George R.R. Martin
   [A-Game-of-Thrones-book-Cover-NOvel.jpg]
   Actually, I lied earlier...the person who requested a "Sci-fi for
   economists" list also asked me to include fantasy. But the Game of
   Thrones books (actually called A Song of Ice and Fire, though few use
   that name anymore) are really the only fantasy novels I can think of
   that deal with economics in an interesting way. You get to see a lot of
   the messed-up economies of medieval times, including feudalism,
   slavery, anarchy, blood sport, and the difficulty of international
   trade with poor information and unreliable transportation.
   Anyway, there's my list. I haven't read everything out there, obviously
   - I hear that Ken MacLeod's books have a lot of economics in them, for
   instance, as well as some of Heinlein's other works. But if you're in
   the econ field and you want to think big deep thoughts about economics
   under different technological and social conditions, these books are
   for you. They're also a lot of fun.
   Update: Mark Palko looks at "[28]Crime novels for economists". Diane,
   looks like you started a meme!
   Update 2: Other sci-fi recommendations via [29]Paul Krugman and [30]Tim
   Worstall.
   Update 3: A couple of additions...
   14. [31]The Year of the Flood, by Margaret Atwood
   [the-year-of-the-flood.jpg]
   I had a very good reason for omitting this book from the original list:
   I hadn't read it yet. Now I have. The Year of the Flood is the
   companion novel to [32]Oryx and Crake, a philosophical
   dystopia/apocalypse novel (and one of the best such novels ever
   written, IMHO). But you can read The Year of the Flood on its own. This
   book is, basically, about a market dystopia. Everything is for sale in
   this future, and yet negative externalities, asymmetric information,
   and weak institutions make the world a nightmare.
   15. [33]When Gravity Fails, by George Alec Effinger
   [220px-WhenGravityFailsBantamSpectra1988.jpg]
   Don't know why I forgot this one earlier. It's basically a novel about
   underground economies and organized crime. Interesting for those who
   like to think about the economics of such things. Also, an extremely
   well-written and fun book.
   16. [34]Stand on Zanzibar, by John Bruenner
   [200px-StandOnZanzibar(1stEd).jpg]
   A lot of commenters have been mentioning this one, and they're
   absolutely right. Stand on Zanzibar is a little dated, but it really
   picks up on a lot of economic trends that were just starting in the 60s
   (e.g. the pricing of previously plentiful commodities such as water).
   The economics are all about the effects of overpopulation, which seems
   less menacing in the 2010s, but is still a major problem in parts of
   the world. A great futurist novel from the past.
   Note: Still no Foundation series. I love the Foundation series, and
   it's really fun, but the economics are crappy (agglomeration economies
   encourage the collapse of empires?). And more importantly, the whole
   conceit of psychohistory is very dangerous for economists; our models
   will never forecast that well, the Universe is stochastic rather than
   deterministic, and we should avoid the temptation for intellectual
   hubris.  Foundation is social science's "physics envy" writ large. We
   are not, and will never be, Hari Seldon, so Foundation, classic as it
   is, doesn't go on my list!

       *Nerd Alert* I would actually trace the idea of Augmented Reality
       and Google Glass back to another science fiction visionary, William
       Gibson (See Virtual Light, circa 1994 and the follow up books in
       the Bridge Trilogy).

            And as for who first imagined stuff, I'm pretty sure it was
            all dreamed up by either E.E. Doc Smith, Jack Vance, or Isaac
            Asimov. But they didn't always explore in detail the ideas
            they tossed off...like when Vance predicted the portable
            personal computer (which he called a "mnemophot")...

            The first projected head-up displays (HUDs) were put in
            airplane cockpits in the 1940s, and Ivan Sutherland developed
            a working head-mounted display (HMD) in the mid-1960s.
            Prototypes of augmented reality systems were running in
            research labs in the early 1990s; coincidentally (or maybe
            not) Thad Starner, a technical manager for Google Glass, has
            used a wearable computer since 1993. I'd guess that AR might
            have appeared in science fiction before these points, but I
            don't know of any early stories about it.

            Yes, they could - they're loaded with the plans for the
            redevelopment of San Francisco, and so when you put them on
            and look out across the Bay, you can see planned tower blocks

       Understanding you can't include every book, but I think Kim Stanley
       Robinson's Mars Trilogy dealt a ton with economics, both the
       alternatives to capitalism such as the gift economy and
       ecoeconomics, as well as the trajectory of our current
       transnational corporations becoming first partners of states, then
       overlords of states, and finally transcending states entirely
       (metanationals). His faith in the renewed interest in and efficacy
       of neomarxist and neoanarchist ideas certainly struck me.

            Interesting because from what I understand (not having read
            the Mars Trilogy), the economics are based on the Social
            Credit movement - which was the economics described in
            Heinlein's "Beyond This Horizon." This can be traced back to
            Heinlein's involvement with a splinter party during the
            depression in California but should not be confused with the
            eugenics (light) nor the Wild West Society of formal dueling
            also featured in that book.
            From your clearly Libertarian bent, I should imagine that you
            would find something to like in CH Douglas's quotation:
            "Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the
            interest of man which is self-development, is above all
            systems, whether theological, political or economic." Douglas
            was the creator of the Social Credit Movement.

            I love the Mars Trilogy but the more detailed the Martian
            "eco-economics" stuff got, the less convincing or compelling I
            found it. On the other hand, I did really appreciate the
            presentation of the more conventional co-operativist ideas and
            their relation to the developing Martian political order.

       Permutation City is wicked good. It's also very good for helping
       one to understand the philosophy behind the whole concept of
       "models" (because of the three different virtual realities in the
       book), which has implications for any field but is particularly
       important for economics, I think, where simplifying assumptions
       like rationality are so essential.

            For the love of all that is good and worthy, let's hope it
            does.
            "For Us, the Living" made for an interesting treatise, and an
            early look at some germs of themes to which Heinlein would
            return and more fully flesh out.
            As engaging literature, with a compelling plotline,
            sympathetic and recognizably human characters, and the spare,
            folksy-professorial style, for all of which RAH would soon
            become beloved, as well as respected and influential, it makes
            for an interesting treatise.

       What about the "Dune" series by Frank Herbert? The original seven
       books, that is, not the ones co-written between Herbert's son and
       Kevin J Anderson. Herbert himself wrote it was meant as a study of
       the interconnections between economics and politics as it was a
       retelling of the Messiah Myth.
       Just a thought.

            Was just thinking the same thing. Admittedly, the Dune series
            is among the few (pure) sci-fi novels that I've actually read.
            However, it seems to me a quintessential tale of resource
            economics/scarcity, property rights, feudalism, etc.

            There's only 6 original Dune books. Unless you count the 7th
            one that exists only in my imagination.
            I'm agreed that it's only peripherally about economics but I
            take exception to the use of "appalling". Sure, they weren't
            as well written, but they weren't terrible. And there's some
            rather insightful ideas that come up in the later books worthy
            of some consideration. Again, less about economics than about
            metaphysics, if you're into that kind of thing.
            The only thing really bad about the series is it's ending and
            the terrible follow up that his son managed to pull off.

       by him that made me think most about economics, Rendezvous with

            Dick was pretty left-wing, but also paranoid about government
            and especially Nixon. Nixon stand-ins appear in RFA, Valis,
            Flow My Tears, and other places. Certain economic ideas do pop
            up in Dick's work--in Galactic Pot Healer, government money is
            worthless and only old silver coins have value. In Ubik, cash
            is replaced by credit cards and AI-driven appliances demand
            micropayments for every service. Dick clearly valued the work
            of tradesmen, craftsmen, and artisans, and distrusted faceless
            corporate entities.
            But on the whole, I'd have to also mention The Space Merchants
            as possibly the best SF novel about capitalism.

       For economic fantasy I suggest Spice and Wolf, a Japanese novel
       series (published in English by Yen Press) where the main character
       is a merchant in a fantasy setting. Plot points include, among
       others, currency exchange rates and speculation, smuggling, and
       manipulating commodity prices.

            I am scooped! But yes. It's one of the few works in any genre
            where people would think of economics in the description
            spontaneously, without having to stretch.
            I also second Pohl and Kornbluth's _The Space Merchants_, and
            maybe Merchants of Venus. SF about advertising, not exactly
            irrelevant.
            Clarke: I think _Imperial Earth_, _The Deep Range_, and
            _Earthlight_ all have economics issues. As much so as Game of
            Thrones, anyway.
            _Taran Wanderer_ had Taran learning about various crafts,
            which is something. The later Hodgell novels include a B-plot
            of "how do I feed my people?" I think economics wandered in
            and out of the Pern novels; at least, one doesn't have to
            wonder how the Weyrs feed themselves, and the characters worry
            about job obsolescence.

            It wasn't about exchange rates per se, but that they were
            minting somewhat debased coins and passing them off as good as
            the old ones. The plot point seemed based on a common
            misconception that ancient precious metal coins were supposed
            to have a constant value, that debasing was cheating. However,
            in the real world folks were greedy gits who would shave
            slivers off the sides of coins. Thus the metal content would
            no longer match the face value of the coin. This is of course
            the equivalent of debasing coins already in circulation. It
            also caused headaches for mints because of Gresham's law: the
            bad drive out the good, in other words the new coins will be
            hoarded and the old ever-shrinking coins remain in
            circulation. So it became common practice to debase newly
            minted coins after a certain time had passed.
            For a more wonkish explanation of how it worked you can read
            fr.ex. this:

       I re-read Deepness and loved it. That one should really be read for
       anyone curious as to what a technologically "mature" civilization
       that would be recognizably human to us would look like. It can be
       rather depressing - Vinge's book is the only SF novel I've ever
       read that managed to make a setting consisting of hundreds of
       colonies scattered across hundreds of light-years (with travel at
       one-third the speed of light) seem claustrophic. A big part of that
       story is showing how the forces that shape society can ultimately
       be beyond even the extraordinary capabilities of someone like Pham
       Nuwen, and how we respond when we are finally forced to face that.
       It also featured augmented reality stuff, although it's treated as
       banal, common-place technology because that's what it is
       in-universe. They have heads-up-displays that overlay what they're
       seeing with "Layers" and interactive displays.

       You say that LeGuin pulled off a world without property, and that
       it's pretty boring. But Anares is an impoverished world, where life
       would be marginal under any conceivable economy. So, confounded
       factors. In that sense, LeGuin set herself too easy a task, much as
       I admire The Dispossessed. How would anarchy have played out on

            Part of it is that no one wanted to take Anarres away from the
            anarchists. Could an anarchist Urras have defended itself from
            a capitalist Anarres? More accurately, the anarchists were
            given freedom and independence on an otherwise unoccupied
            moon.

            As you gentleman point out here, Anares being a barely livable
            world is the key to the viability of whole society. The
            ongoing Man against Nature struggle is what provided the
            ongoing catalyst for the cooperative interaction needed to
            sustain an anarchist society. But I think what Noah isn't
            getting in his description, is that a major theme of the book
            is how much more human and fulfilling that simpler society was
            than Capitalist Urras. You don't have to agree with this idea
            of course, to enjoy the book.

            As I note below, the thing I found most interesting about The
            Dispossessed is that -- although Annares is clearly a better
            society to live in than Urras -- Annares is naturally
            degenerating into bureaucracy and property. It is very hard to
            maintain the society of Annares. Even with universal education
            from early childhood.
            The main plot of half of the book is about the Syndicate of
            Initiative trying to do *exactly what the philosophy of
            Annares claims they should be doing*... and being fought at
            every turn by what can only be called the government of
            Annares, which isn't even supposed to exist. And getting
            badmouthed by the majority of the population.
            In short, although LeGuin makes it clear that the society of
            Annares is a better and happier society to live in, *it isn't
            stable in any way*.

            I second you, Anon. I thought Baroque Cycle--which Stephenson
            insists is "science fiction" even if most sci-fi types think
            otherwise--was brilliant in its various meditations on money
            and early modern/global economies. Reamde would have been more
            profound had it not gotten so bogged down in 25,000-word
            eddies involving K'shetra'ie warriors or whatever the hell
            they're called.

            I haven't read the Baroque Cycle...Stephenson tends to write
            about the periods of history that I know a lot about, and the
            more I know about the reality, the more I get annoyed by
            reading heavily fictionalized historical fiction.

            I would be intertested in your take on the Baroque cycle. Some
            of it I suspect took great liberties with history - especially
            the whole trip around southern Asia - but the exploration of
            credit-finance in Lyons and some of the other bits were quite
            interesting and fit well with what I understand of the
            history. Would love to hear your thoughts.

            anonymised internet payment on economics and politics really
            are mind-blowing and the book is a more cerebral read than

       about the Angel of Death taking a break of her work for a while on

       Pohl's the Starchild Trilogy rather explores the economics of

       And extending out to fantasy "Making Money" by Terry Pratchett is

       Including fantasy novels leads to Sir Terry Pratchett's two novels
       in the Disc-World series, Going Postal and Making Money. As an
       added treat these books are written with a wonderful sense of
       humor, which is often lacking in SF.

            The whole series is worth reading from an economic point of
            view, I think (there are lots of things hidden in the
            background). But it is really Sir Terry Pratchett's intriguing
            thoughts about the respective nature of science and magic and
            the relationship they entertain in our own world that makes it
            (and other works like Strata, and the accompanying books
            Science of the Disc World) worth reading for any scientist.

            The very beginning of Terry Pratchett's Discworld is a story
            about an unknown magic that can make gold as worthless as
            copper, mainly by having a version of the wealthy American or
            Japanese tourist turn up in town with a lot of the former,
            this magic being called
            "reflected-sound-as-of-underground-spirits" - yeah,
            echo-gnomics. Our tourist proceeds to explain to townspeople
            about "inn-sewer-ants", and by, well, the first word of the
            book, in fact,the whole city is burning down.

       Not sure where we put Frederick Pohl and Cyril Kornbluth
       'The Space Merchants'
       and 'Gladiators at Law'
       and also Kornbluth's 'The Syndic'
       But TSM is about a world ruled by advertising agencies, where the
       logic of ever increasing consumption gets them into deep, deep
       trouble. Gladiators at Law has a world run by supercorporations and
       if you lose your job, things get very grim indeed. The Syndic has
       America run by the Mafia, with the government agents trying to get
       back into power.
       Not so much explorations of new economics, but logical extensions
       of where social trends (as seen in the 1950s) was taking us.
       As someone said of The Space Merchants 'it was supposed to be

       true, the humor has lessened'.

       Mack Reynolds brought economics to science fiction in a big way. He
       explored the implications of a world in which technology had
       eliminated the need for the majority of the population to work.
       He also wrote several memorable stories about marketing and
       packaging, specifically about wrappers on bars of soap.
       His work was not high art, I suppose. It was very readable, but he
       wrote quickly and at times included a bit of soft-core pornography
       in some of his novels. I doubt that any of it is still in print
       today.
       Still, it's well worth looking up.

            It is worth knowing that Mack Reynolds ran as the VP for the
            Socialist Party of America (although his Wikipedia entry
            doesn't mention that).
            There was an Ace Double 'Code Duello' and 'Computer War'.
            Code Duello is about a planet so obsessed with national
            security against 'the Englistes' a revolutionary terrorist
            organization that seems to have no members. A team of
            interplanetary agents (a hotpotch of truly eccentric and
            problematic special agents) is sent in to try to help them....
            Computer War is about a society very thinly disguised version
            of the modern USA (say the USA in 2020) being pinned down in a
            war with a low technology society ....
            Both are massive satires of the US of the mid 1960s.
            Both have quite interesting economics themes.

       Ok, decent choices, but ...
       No Brave New World? If there was ever a scifi novel about economics
       - and about the unanticipated consequences of solving economic
       problems - that tops Huxley's classic, I've never read it. A truly
       great book.
       No Norstrilia? The premise of this book is one of the most engaging
       in scifi and is great for economic thinking: what if a poor planet
       of sheep farmers discover that the disease that infects their sheep
       causes them to extrude a saliva that prevents aging? And, btw,
       promotes telepathic powers among the colonists themselves? And they
       become the richest people in the galaxy, but their government cuts
       them off from interstellar trade and overvalues the currency so
       much that everyone is reduced to a life style of a sheep station in
       OZ about 1950? And the galaxy is ruled by philosopher-kings? And a
       lot of the work is done by genetically altered animals (the
       "Underpeople")? And ... well, you get the idea. This is probably
       the single most imaginative piece of scifi every written and the
       only scifi novel I've ever read that give you a sense of real
       disconnect from the present.
       No Stranger in a Strange Land? If you have Moon is a Harsh Mistress
       in here, Heinlein's masterpiece deserves a place too. No need to
       describe this one, I guess; anyone who's read it knows how
       innovative the economic ideas are.

       I have to third the recommendation for the Mars trilogy. The
       sociological and economic aspects are quite explicit and well
       thought through. On top of that, a fictional Martian historian
       toward the end of the 3rd book presents an overarching theory of
       history that is as good as anything I know of from any real
       historian. Specifically, that each phase of history is a struggle
       between the phase that precedes it and the one that follows it. In
       our case, that means a struggle between the oligarchy of the Middle
       Ages and the true democracy that is achieved on Mars later in this
       century. Thus, our political structures have democratic elections,
       but the economy (and through it everything that surrounds elections
       too) are controlled oligarchically.
       Kim Stanley Robinson's "The Years of Rice and Salt" does not have
       so much economics per se, but its portrayal of world history as it
       might have been if the Black Death had completely depopulated
       Europe will be interesting to at least some who find Noah's list of
       interest. He also has a new novel 2312, which seems to be an
       extension of the Mars Trilogy, but which I haven't read yet.
       Noah, thank you for the list. No criticism intended by these
       additions. Fortunately, we live in an age when no one could
       possibly read everything, or even just all the good books. This
       condition itself is actually fairly rare in history.
       And yes, Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson
       And it is just a piece of the book, but Altered Carbon by Richard
       K. Morgan explores what how people might deal with it if you could
       be put into a new young clone of yourself when you get old, but the
       process is obscenely expensive.

       I'd disagree with your comment around "the only fantasy series...".
       Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, a satirical comic-fantasy
       series is incredibly well written and plays with a lot of economic
       concepts, many micro-related. Thud! and the Moist von Lipwig series
       in particular address genuinely interesting micro problems, The
       Fifth Element spends a lot of time looking at regulation, and the
       Last Continent features an interesting take on the concept of fiat
       money. The series has a somewhat British tone, but should be fairly
       accessible.
       Additionally, KJ Parker's "Devices and Desires" trilogy (which I'll
       admit sounds a bit EL James), provides a better exposition of
       medieaval-era economics than Game of Thrones. Set in a world
       dominated by a manufacturing-based control economy, which dominates
       a set of well-described feudal systems, you also see later in the
       books a great description of nomadic merchant economies. In
       addition to being a fascinating read, it's also the best conceived
       fantasy work I've ever read - once I had got through the first half
       of the book, I was completely hooked.
       If you're looking for a shorter introduction to the pseudonymic
       author (who is apparently well recognised in an other genre under
       their real name), I'd recommend Purple and Black, which contains
       less economics, but uses a relatively unusual written form to
       describe the life of a major general in a Rome-like world.
       Please do let me know your thoughts if you do decide to read any of
       them!

       Fantasy with economics:
       China Mieville has a PhD in International Relations from the London
       School of Economics. He wrote his thesis on Marxism and
       international law. He writes brilliant fantasy (and sci-fi) with
       economic, political, and philosophic themes. Iron Council, for
       instance, is basically a mythologizing of a labor revolt, plus
       giant monsters and baleful magicks.
       Daniel Abraham's Long Price deals extensively with the political
       and economic consequences of its system of magic: beings created
       from thought which embody a specific concept. For instance, in the
       first novel there is a being called Seedless, which is leveraged to
       great economic advantage for the province that controls it; it can
       cause seeds to instantly fall away from a warehouse of cotton
       bales. And, it is responsible for the "sad trade", i.e. abortion.
       These books are elegant, with the strongest characterizations I've
       read in any fantasy, and great emotional heft. I read lots of
       fantasy, and this series is my favorite.
       And I second KJ Parker. The Engineer trilogy is basically a how-to
       manual for dragging a medieval culture into the gunpowder age.
       Extremely detailed descriptions of everything from the creation of
       new industries and the economic support they'd need to the
       craftsmanship and tools necessary to, say, forge cannon. All of her
       (his?) work is very concerned with exhaustive technological detail
       (including the economics of technology) in fictional pre-Industrial
       societies.

            Noah, Iron Council is the worst of the Bas Lag books. Perdido
            Street Station and The Scar (especially The Scar) are much
            much better, even if they do not look at economics as much.
            I would also recommend the non-Culture Iain M Banks books,
            especially the Algebraist. The civilization in that book is
            even called the Mercatoria.

       Joe Haldeman's novel "The Long Habit of Living" or "Buying Time" is
       set around a medical foundation that for many years has been
       granting millionaires - in British currency - ten years of youth
       and health in exchange for -all- of their money. This leads to a
       core group of people who can make another million in ten years and
       apparently live forever, and a very, very, very rich foundation,
       although delivering the treatment isn't cheap either. The
       foundation is represented as a social experiment in getting money
       out of the hands of the very very rich, but maybe it's less an
       economic fable and more a boisterous and violent sci-fi thriller.
       Elsewhere, a business of selling tailor-made planets to
       astonishingly wealthy customers meant that Magrathea itself soon
       became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy
       was reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the
       Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion
       worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they
       laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the value of a
       planned political economy.
       Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the
       obscurity of legend.
       In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it,
       and the myth of Magrathea has become a fairy story that parents
       tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to
       become economists.
       If, because one economics graduate was reduced to selling (or
       rather renting) her body on the street in Han Dold City, with the
       additional self-humiliation of a very special service for rich
       johns: she tells them it's okay to be rich. Well, some others with
       her qualifications only do that part.

       In a very unrelated vein (except vis a vis SF and economics), have
       you ever read The Space Merchents, or the sequel, The Merchants'
       War (Frederick Pohl)? A satirical look at capitalism run amok, and
       - in Merchants War - the use of governments to try to reign in it.

            The problem with the Space Merchants is the satire is just
            less funny than it was in the early 1950s.
            The world really has evolved that way and commercial companies
            and their advertising agencies really are that powerful.
            If you remember Robert Heinlein's 'Friday' (it is noted by the
            by that Mexico just surrendered after a war with IBM) and the
            'Lightstone' corporation, then it's like TSM evolved into
            Friday.

       I have to take issue with the OP on Lucifer's Hammer in that I
       don't think the nuclear power plant is being built by an
       entrepreneur? I think it is being built by the local power company?
       SPOILER WARNING
       Like *Inferno* it's a wish fulfillment book for Pournelle and
       Niven. The bad guys become an alliance of cannibals: black ghetto
       gangsters (led by an ex US Army sergeant), and anti-nuke eco
       greenies and socialists, desperate to destroy the nuclear power
       plant.
       The novel mostly reads like an Irwin Allen disaster movie, and may
       have been intended to be sold as a film script. 120 pages of
       'character development' whilst we set up all these characters then
       destroy the City of Los Angeles.
       What is very good is the very realistic description of the battle
       between Senator Jellison's 'good guys' and the
       eco-greenie-socialist-black-cannibal bad guys. Pournelle's military
       experience really comes through (US Artillery Korea). Along with
       David Drake (US Armoured Cavalry, Vietnam) and Glen Cook (infantry
       Vietnam) and Joe Haldeman (combat engineers Vietnam) Pournelle is
       one of the best of the SF/ Fantasy community in writing about wars
       and battles (see also Cyril M. Kornbluth (.50 cal machinegunner,
       Bulge/ Ardennes). Oh and JRR Tolkein of course (the trenches, WW1).

       means something different by 'well-written.' We'll see how these
       stack up. You've certainly expressed your thoughts on them well so
       that's a big help. My cousin recommended 'Accelerando' to me over
       the Christmas holiday. I tried reading an Egan book, geez, it might
       have even been PCity but now I can't remember. I didn't make it too
       far. Though there were things about it I loved, it was a mite

       The anarcho-syndicalist world in The Dispossessed actually sounds
       like a really nice place to live. Apart from, you know, being a
       harsh barren moon, which is really not the fault of the
       anarcho-syndicalists.
       The really interesting thing about The Dispossessed is LeGuin's
       insight that a world without property and hierarchy would be very
       hard to maintain: that it would naturally start degenerating into
       property and hierarchy very quickly. Despite indoctrination from
       birth, the "Syndicate of Initiative" has to go through the process
       of anarcho-syndicalist revolution against the *property-owning
       bureaucracy* which has crept up, unbidden, on the purportedly
       anarcho-syndicalist world...
