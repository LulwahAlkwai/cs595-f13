[79]Rationally Speaking Podcast Live: with Guest Ben Goldacre

   When: Thursday February 21 - 7:00 PM

   Where: University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street ([80]map)

   Free and open to the public!

   Join us first for a special lecture by Dr. Benjamin Goldacre about his
   new book, Bad Pharma: How Drug Companies Mislead Doctors and Harm
   Patients, and then Dr. Goldacre will be our special guest on a live
   taping of the Rationally Speaking podcast.

   ------------------

   We like to imagine that medicine is based on evidence and the results
   of fair tests. In reality, those tests are often profoundly flawed. We
   like to imagine that doctors are familiar with the research literature
   about a drug, when in reality much of the research is hidden from them
   by drug companies. We like to imagine that doctors are impartially
   educated, when in reality much of their education is funded by the
   pharmaceutical industry. We like to imagine that regulators let only
   effective drugs onto the market, when in reality they approve useless
   drugs, with data on side effects casually withheld from doctors and
   patients.

   All these problems have been shielded from public scrutiny because
   they're too complex to capture in a sound bite. But Ben Goldacre shows
   that the true scale of this murderous disaster fully reveals itself
   only when the details are untangled. He believes we should all be able
   to understand precisely how data manipulation works and how research
   misconduct on a global scale affects us.

   With Goldacre's characteristic flair and a forensic attention to
   detail, Bad Pharma reveals a shockingly broken system and calls for
   something to be done. This is the pharmaceutical industry as it has
   never been seen before.
