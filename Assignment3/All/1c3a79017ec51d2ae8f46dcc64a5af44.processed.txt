[39]Lowell Observatory Pushes To Name an Asteroid "Trayvon" 588

   Posted by [40]samzenpus on Thursday September 05, 2013 @11:03PM
   from the victim-belt dept.
   Flash Modin writes "The observatory where Pluto was discovered is
   pushing to name an asteroid after a black teenager killed in a
   controversial confrontation in Florida last year. William Lowell Putnam
   III says his family has identified with the cause of African American
   rights, and thus [41]an asteroid named after Trayvon Martin is
   perfectly appropriate. Putnam is the sole trustee of the observatory,
   which was founded by Percival Lowell during his search for canals on
   Mars. Astronomers at the observatory discovered the asteroid in 2000,
   but it has not been formally named. Putnam has already asked the Minor
   Planet Center once to designate the asteroid 'Trayvon,' but they told
   him the designation was 'premature.' Now that there's been a verdict,
   the observatory is reapplying in hopes the naming body will see things
   different."

                 What I really dislike about the whole thing are these

                 are using this as a political indictment against Black or

                 People have died because of it. They will stop at nothing
                 until they light up the fire of another bloody racial

                      I found bad judgement in the actions of Martin and
                      Zimmerman.
                      I agree, both of them failed to pick the safest
                      possible path. GZ should have stayed in his truck,
                      and he should have looked the other way. TM should
                      have walked directly home. They haven't done that.
                      However none of what they actually did - until the
                      first blow landed - was illegal. They were not
                      accused of walking the public streets; they were not
                      accused of looking at people; they were not accused
                      of talking to each other. All that is legal. (Well,
                      GZ was actually accused of that because the DA
                      wanted to hit him with crime of racism; but that was
                      unfair, and it didn't work.)
                      Being not exceptionally careful is not a crime. You
                      aren't careful if you choose to walk through a
                      ghetto at midnight. But it's your right - and if you
                      survive you won't be put on trial. All actions of GZ
                      and TM were legal - until TM struck. That's when
                      legality ended, and that's what got TM killed. TM
                      would be killed just as well if he walked up to any
                      stranger and hit him in the face. The preceding
                      actions may have contributed to anger, or fear of
                      disrespect, that TM seemingly had. But those actions
                      are just as legal for them as for a man to follow a
                      woman in a dark alley. They just go in the same
                      direction. A woman may be scared; but legally it
                      means nothing; she is not entitled to, for example,
                      turning around and throwing a knife at the man.
                      Trayvon may have been upset, but that gave him no
                      special right to assault anyone. He held a phone in
                      his hand all the time - he could have called 911 at
                      any time if he had a genuine fear. He, an active
                      football player, could have outrun pretty much
                      anyone and be at home within seconds. There are many
                      paths TM could have taken that don't include hitting
                      people in the face and then trying to murder them.

                 how they smoke it all the time and get modded insightful.

                                Checking the transcript, it seems
                                Zimmerman identified him as "looks black"
                                - nonetheless, I believe the testimony was
                                that he didn't know Martin's race when he
                                started following him. He only knew for
                                sure when Martin turned to confront him
                                the first time as he was on the phone with
                                the dispatcher.

                                     "Amateur Cop" is a thing in the US.
                                     Zimmerman was part of a
                                     police-sponsored neighborhood watch
                                     program, in which people take it upon
                                     themselves to ... well, watch the
                                     neighborhood. The opening of this
                                     whole thing is that he saw a guy that
                                     "looked suspicious" (for whatever
                                     reason), got out of his car, and
                                     followed at a distance. That's pretty
                                     normal.
                                     The "At a distance" thing is
                                     important, and something a lot of
                                     people missed. Trayvon turned down a
                                     street and went south; Zimmerman
                                     passed that street heading east,
                                     watching to see where Trayvon was
                                     going while reporting to the
                                     dispatcher. What Zimmerman was not
                                     doing was following Trayvon down the
                                     road in the shadows, inching closer,
                                     trying to get a bead on the little
                                     black kid; everyone wants to
                                     perpetuate this "stalking an innocent
                                     teenager" thing anyway, but that's
                                     not what happened.
                                     What happened after that is less
                                     understood. Somehow Trayvon got to
                                     his house (south), then came back 100
                                     meters (north) and a confrontation
                                     occurred. This became a physical
                                     altercation, which ended with
                                     Zimmerman shooting Trayvon to death.
                                     The murder argument comes down to an
                                     argument over whether or not
                                     Zimmerman was being beaten to death
                                     (or reasonably believed he was being
                                     beaten to death)--this is why you
                                     keep hearing that Trayvon was "armed
                                     with concrete" and smashing
                                     Zimmerman's head into the sidewalk.
                                     Zimmerman had a permit to carry a gun
                                     because he's a shitty fighter. If he
                                     wasn't such a useless lump of shit,
                                     maybe he could have fought back and
                                     controlled the situation. He's lucky
                                     Trayvon didn't just take his gun and
                                     shoot him to death with it. Non-US
                                     people might find the concept of
                                     regular citizens carrying guns a
                                     little displacing--it's not a thing
                                     people do in England, for
                                     example--but in the US, people
                                     actually carry guns in case they're
                                     attacked. Beyond that, shooting
                                     Trayvon to death is just the natural
                                     result of being in a situation where
                                     he thought he was gonna die--that is,
                                     the natural action is to try to not
                                     die, and the only capable way he
                                     could think of to not die was to kill
                                     Trayvon.
                                     Everything between the confrontation
                                     and the death is unclear. Fortunately
                                     for Zimmerman (and the rest of us),
                                     because nothing here screams "violent
                                     premeditated or negligent homicide",
                                     the only rational thing to do is
                                     accept "self-defense" and move on.
                                     Unfortunately, people are not
                                     rational and start screaming for
                                     blood, trying to blame Zimmerman
                                     while dismissing the very real and
                                     strong possibility that he was, in
                                     fact, going to die if he didn't shoot
                                     Trayvon right there. So we have this
                                     mess.
                                     I don't understand the "Civil Rights"
                                     involved. They say Trayvon's rights
                                     were violated. What rights? He was
                                     observed in public; if he wasn't
                                     doing anything bad, the police
                                     wouldn't have even been able to
                                     search him. He could have 20 pounds
                                     of cocaine and stolen jewelry on him,
                                     and the cops could show up like "we
                                     heard reports of a suspicious
                                     person," and he's like "Everything's
                                     alright here," and they're like "Can
                                     we search your bag?" "No." That's it.
                                     Nothing actually happening here? The
                                     cops don't even get to frisk you.
                                     Other people are entitled to observe
                                     you, the police are entitled to pass
                                     through the neighborhood and ask you
                                     if you're alright and whatever, but
                                     if you're not obviously committing a
                                     crime (even if you really ARE, but
                                     it's not visible and they have no
                                     probable cause to assume you're a
                                     criminal) then they can't do shit.
                                     You could have burglary tools and a
                                     bomb in your backpack and they can't
                                     even check it to make sure you just
                                     have school books (unless somebody
                                     reported seeing you using burglary
                                     tools to try to break into
                                     somewhere).
                                     I guess the only civil right here
                                     might be the right to, you know, not
                                     get shot to death; and you
                                     immediately waive that right when

     lack of evidence for all these lazy-ass assertions.
                           I think we're far past the point where anyone's
                           the least bit interested in evidence. Instead,
                           everyone who talks about this case simply makes
                           up stuff - often ludicrously detailed - to
                           support their own notions, often twisted by
                           insane troll logic (no, you don't really want
                           Zimmerman to be the poster boy for gun rights,
                           now do you?).
                           Which is why I think this asteroid should be
                           named "Trayvon-Zimmerman". Human capacity for
                           self-deception certainly deserves a monument,
                           and if irony is on our side archeologists in a
                           few (dozen) generations might well promote it

       I don't really think naming celestial bodies after victims is a
       good idea.
       Astronomers usually want to inspire hope, and looking up at things
       named after victims just doesn't seem right.

            I don't really think naming celestial bodies after victims is
            a good idea.
            Astronomers usually want to inspire hope, and looking up at
            things named after victims just doesn't seem right.
            He's obviously not a victim if the person who killed him was
            acquitted by a jury of justifiable homicide.

                 innocent civilians
                 Yes, heres the thing, a jury found that Martin WASNT
                 innocent, and that there was grounds for a plea of
                 self-defense. That, too is a right that citizens have.
                 laws that somehow support this disgusting behavior
                 Most societies that you would want to live in have both
                 an adversarial court system, and a defense for killing on
                 the grounds of self-defense. Thank goodness that is the
                 case here. What laws, specifically are you thinking of--
                 hopefully not the "stand your ground" law which had
                 absolutely no relevance to the case?
                 stand your ground laws, carry/ conceal laws: they have to

                 laws. Look through the court transcripts and see if
                 "stand your ground" had any relevance: You will find it
                 did not. The issue at stake was whether Zimmerman was
                 justified in killing Martin in self-defense.
                 You seem to have bought into the
                 race-card-Zimmerman-was-a-racist story that was spun up
                 by the media, so I really suggest you go back and look at
                 the facts, not the op-eds and commentary that was spun up
                 around the whole issue. The amount of bias that came out
                 in this whole ordeal was astounding, from the doctored
                 recordings, to the doctored photos, to the claims that
                 Zimmerman was white, to the claims that white-on-black
                 violence is anywhere near common (in reality, 80+% of
                 violence is intra-racial-- white-on-white,
                 black-on-black, etc).

       Regardless of the details of the case itself, it's pretty clear
       that Martin was a racist (he used racial insults against
       Caucasians). He does not deserve to have an asteroid named after
       him, and if the civil rights movement picks him as a symbol, it
       will only hurt their cause.

       So exactly what African American rights is it that William Lowell
       Putnam III says his family has identified with, and why are they
       any different than the rights any other person living in the US
       has? Is it the right to beat up someone because you find them
       creepy?? To pummel someone just because you think they are
       following you, even though they haven't made any overtly
       threatening moves? Simple because someone is a racist and thinks
       that if a light skinned person is following them the 'crackah' must
       be up to no good??
       Or is it some other made-up rights that I'm not aware of???
       It's only controversial to those that tried their best to turn it
       into a race thing instead of a self-defense thing. The racists that
       forced Florida to have a wasted trial with no real evidence for the
       prosecution just to appease so many racists. Those that want to
       ignore the evidence presented in court and play 'what if' games
       that don't use any facts at all but assumptions made my people who
       weren't even there.
       Go ahead .. name your asteroid Trayvon. It will still be an
       insignificant speck of dust in the universe. Kind of fitting really
       ... an insignificant asteroid named for someone that tried to kill
       someone else. That if he had lived could very well be in jail by

     some point I said 'Cut it out.' And then, 'I'm calling 911.' That's

     The altercation seemed to escalate, according to Good. The struggle
     moved to the cement pathway, and he said the person in dark clothing
     straddled the other man in "mixed martial arts position" he later
     described to police as a "ground and pound." He said he saw "arm
     movements going downward," though he couldn't be certain the person
     on top was striking the person on the bottom.

                                     absolutely nothing points to it,
                                     including his own offline and online

            Yes, let's name all of the asteroids after attempted murders

            Wow. I hope you realize your version goes a lot further than
            the court verdict.
            The court found that there wasn't sufficient proof that
            Zimmerman initiated the fight, or that he didn't have
            reasonable grounds to fear for his life.
            That's a long way from determining that Martin, initiated the
            confrontation, tried to kill Zimmerman, shoplifted (first I
            heard of this), or was going to smoke drugs that evening
            (irrelevant even if true).

                      There was absolutely no evidence that Zimmerman
                      initiated the fight considering that Trayvon did not
                      have a mark on him except the fatal gunshot wound.
                      All that the injuries show is that Martin was
                      winning, and outside of Zimmerman's testimony we
                      don't really have evidence that Martin started the
                      fight either.
                      Considering that it was not until Zimmerman was
                      being "ground pounded", quoting the prosecution
                      witness testimony, it seems pretty obvious what
                      happened here: Zimmerman was overzealous while
                      following a suspicious person walking through his
                      neighborhood, who confronted Zimmerman and then
                      attacked him after not liking whatever response
                      followed, if any.
                      Assuming that happened the response could be part of
                      an initiation.
                      Had Zimmerman been looking to follow and kill a
                      black guy, then he would have pulled his gun before
                      the beginning of the fight, and he would have lost
                      it after having his head repeatedly thrown against
                      the pavement, which would have been Zimmerman's last
                      moments alive on Earth because you do not bash
                      someone's skull into pavement repeatedly to say
                      hello.
                      Not many claim that "Zimmerman been looking to
                      follow and kill a black guy". They claim he followed
                      Martin for no reason, somehow instigated or didn't
                      try to avoid the confrontation (knowing he had a
                      gun), then shot Martin when his life wasn't really
                      in jeopardy.

                           Martin was deserving of some community service
                           and some counselling. He didn't deserve to die.
                           Perhaps not, but that's a risk you always take
