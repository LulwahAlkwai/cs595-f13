   Why Microsoft's Next CEO Will Fail (CIO)
   We live in a blame culture and the system Microsoft and other firms
   have employed called forced ranking tends to make that worse in places
   like Microsoft. This means that problems recur and the focus is on
   firing or punishing someone (often not the one responsible) and not on
   understanding the problem so you don't make the mistake again. Unless
   Microsoft moves to fix the cause of Ballmer's failure the next CEO be
   even more likely to fail because they likely won't have Ballmer's
   strengths but will mirror his weaknesses. This is my story in CIO this
   week:
