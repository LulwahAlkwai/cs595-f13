   Jaguar Crossover Rears Its Rather Pretty Head
   This is likely the one thing Porsche did poorly as I still their
   crossover looks like crap. The Jaguar crossover show car captures much
   of the design element of the current Jaguar line and still looks sleek
   and beautiful. It will be interesting to see how much of the advanced
   interior technology like the rear center mounted screen actually makes
   it into the final car. But I could actually buy this thing and given
   how much Jaguar's reliability has improved since Tata bought it and put
   it under Mercedes trained management, I likely wouldn't regret the
   purchase. Check out the picture gallery. Article in Gizmag today:
