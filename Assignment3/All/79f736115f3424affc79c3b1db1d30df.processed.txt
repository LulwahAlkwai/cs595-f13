   What's This?
   Facebook-graph-search-job-search
   By Joshua Waldman2013-09-14 15:59:13 +0200

   Graph Search is a way to explore Facebook's wide array of information
   about people. The feature has slowly rolled out over the past few
   months and Facebook expects to extend this feature to everyone by the
   end of 2013.

   Considering the huge amount of information Facebook has about people,
   like what they're interested in, books they read, restaurants they like
   and more, it's surprising the company has taken this long to create a
   social graph enabled search engine. As someone serious about your
   career, imagine all the possibilities for networking this feature opens
   up -- like finding out where friends of friends work, or finding other
   ukulele enthusiasts in your network.

   Recruiters are already taking advantage of Graph Search. For example,
   the California-based social recruiting software company [47]Work4 will
   be offering recruiters a candidate searching solution that leverages
   Facebook's one billion users to fill jobs. For example, recruiters can
   search for "people who worked as Software Engineers in San Francisco,
   California this year" in order to fill a local engineering role.

   Here are a few ways you can use this feature to supercharge your
   professional networking efforts.

Use Graph Search to Expand Your First Degree Network

   Once Graph Search is enabled, it can be found at the very top of your
   Facebook Profile. By using search phrases, instead of keywords, you can
   discover all sorts of people in and outside of your current network.

   Previously, it was very difficult to know what companies were
   represented in your network and extended (friends of friends) network.
   Now you can see what companies you have connections to, locations you
   might have acquaintances in and even brands your network prefers. For
   example, as evidenced by the screenshot below, I can use Graph Search
   to find employees of Charlie Sheen who live in Rhode Island.

   jss

   So if you are targeting a company to work for and want to know if
   people in your network (friends or friends of friends) work there, you
   can. And with Facebook's pay-to-message feature, you can pay to have
   your message delivered to their inbox.

   Try some of these graph search ideas to advance your own job search
   networking:
     * people who work at (company) who live in (location)
     * people who work at (company) who went to (school)
     * friends of my friends who work at (company)
     * companies my friends like who live in (location)

It Doesn't Have to Be Job Search Either, Try Ukuleles

   Anything that Facebook records is fair game, including schools people
   went to and books people read, to find commonalities.

   When I traveled to Nashville for a speech for Belmont University, I
   used Graph Search to see what restaurants my friends liked in the area
   by searching "restaurants in Nashville my friends like."

It's Not Totally Perfect, Results Aren't Always Accurate

   Graph Search isn't perfect. For example, I don't Like every restaurant
   I actually like; and I don't like every restaurant I Like. And I'm sure
   it won't be long before some businesses try to game the system by
   getting artificial Likes, thus skewing your search results.

   Also, not everyone does a very good job filling out their About Me
   sections with complete work and education histories. Still, I think
   you'll be surprised at the kinds of information you can gather from
   this tool.

   People say Facebook isn't for professional networking. However, since
   when in human history did people not rely on their friends and family
   for career opportunities?

   What do you think? Will you consider using Facebook for your career
   advancement? Let us know in the comments.
