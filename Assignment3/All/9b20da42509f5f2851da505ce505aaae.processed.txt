   Smartwatches will eventually make Smartphone screens obsolete. #Uplinq
   Granted this won't happen overnight but if you if you look at either
   the Samsung Gear or Qualcomm Toq you'll see a device that moves the
   screen from your phone to your watch and as that screen gets more and
   more capable the need to use the one on your watch will decline. Of the
   two watches the Qualcomm pushes this the hardest because they are using
   a transflective design which will actually work better in bright light
   than your Smartphone screen does now. This is the focus of my Digital
   Trends column this week. Digital Trends:
