[120]Dung Beetles Watch the Galaxy (That's How They Roll)

   by Ed Yong

   From all across the galaxy, the light of billions of stars finds its
   way to Earth, passes through our atmosphere, and enters the eyes of a
   small South African beetle rolling a ball of dung. The beetle's eyes
   are not sensitive enough to pick out individual stars but it can see
   the Milky Way as a fuzzy stripe, streaking across the night sky. With
   two of its four eyes, it gazes into the guts of our galaxy, and uses
   starlight to find its way home.

   Dung beetles eat the droppings of other animals. They congregate upon
   piles of fresh dung, gather it into tasty balls and roll it home.
   Competition at a dung pile is intense and the path home can be long,
   dangerous and tiring. So, it pays the beetle to keep the straightest
   possible course.

   Like many insects, dung beetles that roll in the day can detect the way
   that sunlight changes as it enters the Earth. Light behaves like a wave
   that normally vibrates in every possible direction. When it hits
   particles in the atmosphere, it becomes polarised, so it only vibrates
   in one direction depending on where the sun is in the sky. Many insects
   can see these patterns of polarised light, which are invisible to us,
   and use them to orient themselves.

   Keeping a straight line is even harder at night, and even humans veer
   off in a curve if we can't see anything. "For beetles with
   poor-resolution compound eyes, it pays to grab a hold of any visual
   cues in the night sky to help them steer straight," says [121]Ken Cheng
   from Macquarie University. Some use the moon, which also produces
   patterns of polarised light, albeit a million times dimmer than those
   from the sun. In 2003, [122]Eric Warrant from Lund University found
   that some dung beetles, which come out at night can use these patterns
   to [123]keep their paths straight.

   But one beetle, known as Scarabaeus satyrus, was doing something else.
   Warrant and his colleague Maria Dacke noticed that even on clear,
   moonless nights, this species could [124]keep a reasonably straight
   course. "We thought this was odd," he says. Perhaps the beetles were
   navigating by starlight? Humans, birds and seals can certainly use the
   constellations to find their way around, but we all share similar eyes.
   Could an insect's eyes use the same cues?

   Dacke and Warrant found out by capturing dung beetles and placing them
   in a circular open-topped arena, surrounded by black walls to obscure
   the sight of any landmarks. The beetles were raised into the middle of
   the arena with their faecal cargo. They rolled off and once they hit
   the edge, they fell through a small gap and made an audible thump.
   Since each beetle rolls at a constant speed, Dacke and Warrant could
   measure how far they had travelled by marking the time between their
   entrance into the arena and the sound of their exit.

   Under a full moon, they took 21 seconds. Under a moonless, starry
   night, their paths wavered more and they took 40 seconds. On a cloudy
   night, or if Dacke and Warrant covered their heads with a black cap
   ([125]this isn't the first time they've dressed up dung beetles for
   science), the beetles took around 120 seconds to reach the edge.

   is transparent, so the beetle can still see through it.) Credit: Eric
   Warrant

   Dung beetles roll their balls backwards, walking face-down and pushing
   with their hind legs. That seems like the wrong position for
   stargazing, but they have two pairs of eyes, one pointing up and one
   pointing down. It's the upwards pair that sees the stars.

   But to work out what they are actually seeing, Dacke and Warrant
   couldn't just cover the beetle's eyes. They had to somehow manipulate
   the night sky itself. So they took their beetles and arenas to the
   planetarium at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.

   If they projected the bright stripe of the Milky Way onto the
   building's 18-metre domed ceiling, the beetles could find their way out
   of the arena reasonably quickly. It didn't matter whether the team
   added another 4,000 stars--it was the Milky Way that mattered. If they
   left out this galactic stripe, or only added the 18 brightest stars,
   the beetles took much longer to find their way out.

   "I really like the simplicity of their experiments. They're delicious
   and simple like sushi," says [126]Lars Chittka, an insect expert at
   Queen Mary University of London. "It shows that even in the
   post-genomic world, the best science is still often driven by ideas
   rather than expensive equipment."

   This isn't the first time that scientists have brought animals to
   planetariums to test their navigation. They've used these artificial
   domes to show that indigo buntings, flying south for the winter,
   navigate by flying away from the North Star. The dung beetles, however,
   clearly aren't focusing on a single bright star. Instead, they're using
   the collective light of billions of them.

   "Have the beetles specifically evolved the ability to navigate by using
   the Milky Way, or are they just opportunistically using any landmark
   that stays in place for the duration of their path?" Chittka wonders.
   "The Milky Way might not have a special salience for the beetles, but
   just be one of a class of cues that can be used to maintain a constant
   direction, such as a tree, a mountain, the sun, or the moon."

       Wouldn't what they projected in the planetarium be brighter than
       what beetles could see in the wild?

       January 25, 2013
       ^maybe its just relative, the milky way is brighter in the dome as
       well as in the sky

       Given the nature of their eyes it makes sense that the larger
       luminous "object" which is also linear would be a lot of help.

       Does light pollution effect the ability of the beetles to navigate?
    7. Ed
       January 28, 2013
       @Hannah - Presumably so, but they live in the middle of the South
       African veldt, where light pollution is pretty low. Unless there
       are clouds, the Milky Way is bright and visible on most nights.
