"Stolen from Steve"

   Victor Hugo has been quoted (or misquoted, depending on who you ask) as
   stating that "nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has
   come."  This week it was followed up with "...and the most powerful
   thing is entrepreneurship educators."

   This statement concluded two and a half of the most transformational
   days of my professional career.  Steve Blank ended the Lean LaunchPad
   Educators Program just as powerfully as it began, with his ego-free
   eloquence and a challenge to us to move forward transforming the way we
   think and act in startup companies, and to educate others in the
   methodology and mindset that could support this transformation.

   So what is Lean LaunchPad (LLP)?  You can read more on [11]Steve's
   blog, but in a nutshell (and please know that a nutshell does not
   suffice) the LLP methodology utilizes the [12]Business Model Canvas to
   walk through stages of Customer Discovery, a concept that pushes
   entrepreneurs to "get out of the building" and find out if what they
   THINK they should build is really what people want, really what will
   solve the problem at hand, and really something for which they will
   pay.   It also teaches us that execution (something I have viewed as
   the most valuable thing before now) should absolutely not happen until
   Customer Development has been experienced and completed and there is
   actually something worth executing.  Novel idea, right?

   The methodology shows us that the business plan should not come first
   (and reminds us how poorly we use it in practice), a concept many other
   experts such as Guy Kawasaki preach. However, until now, I did not
   actually have a decent replacement for it.

   Lean LaunchPad is not new.  Steve and his evangelists have been
   teaching it for years now at Berkeley, Stanford, Columbia, and recently
   multiple other universities as well as the [13]NSF I-Corps.  The method
   is not trendy or short-lived; it has years of business success under
   its "belt," and its track record speaks for itself.  Steve has hopes
   and dreams of transforming the angel and venture capital circles with
   it and has seen progress in Silicon Valley already (hopefully Phoenix
   is not far behind).

   This is all well and good...but you may be doubtful that this could
   actually be transformational.  And I understand that.  When I simply
   skimmed the book, and did not become truly invested in the
   conversation, I was intrigued but not yet convinced.  When I had the
   opportunity this past week to meet and hear from the LLP "Godfather"
   himself, and his colleagues, [14]Jerry Engel of Berkeley and [15]Jim
   Hornthal of Travelocity, and to sit amongst some of the most innovative
   educators in the world, the reality of the concept hit me hard.  Marek
   and Aga from Poland, as an example, are teaching the methodology to
   startups in Krakow (see the photo of our lovely dinner in Berkeley),
   and there are many more like them.

   It IS transformational.  It WILL impact the way we create
   startups.  And I am thrilled to bring it to [16]Arizona State student
   entrepreneurs (about which I will continue to blog through the
   semester).

   On a final note, I have to make this personal because it was a truly
   personal event.  I was honored to meet and chat with Steve Blank,
   hearing stories of his young prankster days and learning more about his
   startup experiences.  Mostly because he is brilliant.  But also because
   he is a humble, genuine, engaging human being who wants his word to
   spread because he believes this will transform the startup process.  As
   we made our way through the conference Steve invited us to use all of
   his materials that he has spent years creating...asking us only to mark
   them with "Stolen from Steve."

   No problem; proud to be a thief.
