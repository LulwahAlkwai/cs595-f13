The Portable Espresso Machine for Bona Fide Caffeine Addicts

   Who needs Starbucks when you can have your own personal caffeine marker
   at ALL times? Yes, you heard me right. Say hello, world, to the
   portable espresso machine. Just in time for finals.

   Ain't nobody got time to crash from a coffee high, and The Nomad
   Espresso Machine knows that. No batteries, electricity or high-pressure
   gas cartridges required. Oh, did we mention it's green, too? Like,
   beyond just the color.

   It's hand operated too, so all you need to do is pack ground coffee,
   add hot water and push. Presto! Insta "hand-crafted" espresso.

       I own a Handpresso that does the same thing for much cheaper and is
       much more portable.

       Because we all want to be like the old ladies who carry packets of
       their favorite non-dairy creamer wherever they go because they
       cannot bear to try something else, we have to carry our home coffee
       everywhere with us like complete yutzes too.
