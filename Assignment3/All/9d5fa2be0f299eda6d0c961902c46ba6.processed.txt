               o mcmax3000
                 That's not quite the same, as it doesn't have a digital
                 offer for 360/Xbox One available.
                 Given that they've gone as far as to name this, and call
                 it a `program', I imagine other games will be added to it
                 though (likely the same games that are part of the season
                 pass thing, which would be CoD, BF4, AC IV, and Watch
                 Dogs).

            what is wrong with you digital only guys? crazy. fyi get a ps3
            if you want day one digitals right now.
     * Amkof
       I was actually just wondering how MS/Acitvision/EA were going to
       handle this. I'm still debating whether to go full digital or not.
       Seems like an elegant solution. Major: Do you know if there's any
       restrictions like there are on Xbox Video where you can only
       download for a year after your original purchase?
     * Amkof
       Weird my comment disappeared.
       I like this solution, I've been debating on going purely digital
       for the next generation so this fits right into how I'd like to
       receive my games. Only concern though is whether there will be
       restrictions on how long after you make your initial purchase you
       can download your game again. Like on Xbox Video right now if you
       buy a movie, you can only download it for a year after your
       purchase. Does anyone know if this is the case?
          + mcmax3000
            They've never put restrictions like that on any game content
            on the 360 (I can still re-download XBLA games I bought at
            launch eight years ago), so I can't see why they'd start
            adding restrictions like that now.
               o Amkof
                 Yeah MS has always been amazing for that. I just have
                 never bought anything from their Games on Demand program
                 so I wasn't sure if there were any limitations like that
                 there.

            Introducing the Xbox Game Ahead Program
            Gamers can purchase a disc-less dual-license digital version
            of Call of Duty: Ghosts at participating retailers for a
            suggested retail price of $69.99. This version will include
            the Xbox 360 digital version of Call of Duty: Ghosts, as well
            as the Xbox One digital version of Call of Duty: Ghosts -
            linked and unlocked via a user's Xbox Live gamertag. Look for
            more information on how to pre-order at participating
            retailers in the coming weeks.
            Via the Game Ahead Program, players can also purchase a
            digital version of Call of Duty: Ghosts directly from the Xbox
            Live Marketplace for a suggested retail price of $59.99. And,
            when ready to upgrade to Xbox One, you can purchase a digital
            Xbox One version of Call of Duty: Ghosts for a suggested
            retail price of just $10 on the Xbox Live Marketplace until
            March 31, 2014.
          + usrev
            why would you go digital? do you really like not owning you
            games?
            I never understood how anyone could want digital until they
            are much cheaper than retail. there is no benefit to digital.
            you can't trade it in, share the game effectively, and the
            prices are usually more expensive than retail.
               o Amkof
                 To provide context, I'm a huge Steam guy, so I'm used to
                 this (irrational) thought that I don't "own" my games.
                 Granted yes I get a lot of those games at huge discounts,
                 but a lot of those games I would not have bought had they
                 been at that price, so the prices met my utility of those
                 games. Typically if I buy a game I want, it is at launch,
                 so there will be no price difference (typically). There
                 are situation however, like right now for me, where I
                 have all the games I want at launch pre-ordered for $20
                 off each at Best Buy. In those cases I would buy a
                 physical copy. It is not going to be a black and white
                 situation for me, but if they are equal in price I will
                 just go for the digital copy because I hate cases and
                 discs floating around my place.
                 To answer your arguments, I don't care if it's not
                 cheaper then retail, because I don't trade my games, I
                 don't share my games. Your argument for prices being more
                 expensive is unfounded, you are applying a past
                 experience with the digital ecosystem from 2 year ago and
                 applying it to a future new digital ecosystem. We have
                 seen a change in MS' policies, so we should wait to see
                 how they will treat the system vs judging them by a past
                 they are clearly moving away from.
               o Pearson Smith
                 Usually when I buy a game, I make sure it's totally worth
                 the $60 because by the time I want to sell it, I get $10
                 back. It takes me a while to finish games because of how
                 busy I am. The most games I play are the multiplayer
                 games, and once the next multiplayer game comes out like
                 Battlefield 4, Battlefield 3 is worthless (especially
                 when someone has to pay $10 for an online pass if bought
                 used and go through that $50 Premium BS). For sharing,
                 like I said, I play multiplayer games which now only
                 allow one person per console and require online passes.
                 So digital will be awesome, especially when I don't have
                 spend on time and gas to get to the retailer or pay
                 shipping. The game downloads overnight and it's ready to
                 play in the morning. I also don't have to pay that extra
                 $3 for disc protection.
     * mcmax3000
       According to a post on OneOfSwords' blog, yeah, it will be.
     * Pearson Smith
       I hope they do this with more games. A lot of my friends on Xbox
       360 won't get a new Xbox One for a while. It would be nice to play
       against them on the latest games. They should make the Xbox One
       games more like the Blu-rays we get today. Buy a Blu-ray and the
       DVD and digital copy is included.
          + Catalyst
            They will. Ubisoft has announced something similar with
            "Assassin's Creed IV", and I'm sure any other major titles
            will support such an offer.
     * SoulSnatcha
       Thank goodness for this! I was planning on going all digital and
       was a little down because I would HAVE to get the disc version for
       the One as I was doing the upgrade/trade-in deal with GameStop and
       my console is reserved at a different store.
     * Jeremy Trifilo
       I am wondering if this will be made available for the special
       editions as I would like to buy the Digital version of the Hardened
       Edition. Also any idea if you actually get both the Xbox 360 & Xbox
       One licenses or is it something where the Xbox One license overlaps
       / expires the Xbox 360 license once you make use of it?
          + mcmax3000
            No digital hardened edition for 360. Will be for Xbox One
            though.
     * Jeremy Trifilo
       Well I am a bit curious if you get both licenses, but the $10.00
       upgrade for disc version is where you return your Xbox 360 disc for
       an Xbox One disc @ $10.00 more. I have only seen information
       regarding the standard edition for this service so far. If this
       $69.99 offer provides you with both licenses it is definitely worth
       considering @ $34.99 per license apposed to $59.99 per license or
       in the upgrade instance $69.99 per license. However I do hope for
       more information provided on the exact way this all works. I myself
       am definitely considering Digital this time around.
     * roozbeh, again
       Yay!
     * David K
       Larry, does this mean I can buy the 360 version and upgrade to the
       XBox One version while KEEPING the 360 version as well? Madness.
          + mcmax3000
            It does.
          + GmailIsDown
            yep. this beats the Amazon trade-in deal and the Bestbuy
            upgrade deal if you want to keep both copies.
               o usrev
                 not really. you are spending the same amount of money but
                 only get digital copies. unless you truly plan on going
                 back to the 360 versions of the games.
                 they hold no value once bought, while the regular trade
                 in programs will have about $30-$40 in value.
                 so next year when cod 17.6 comes out you can't sell COD
                 ghosts for some money toward it.
                    # closingracer
                      Ya but I know plenty of people who aren't moving to
                      next gen and wish they did something like this for
                      madden and nba 2k since I could keep playing my
                      leagues in those games and still get next gen
                      versions
          + Brian
            I believe so, but only digitally. Not if you buy the disc.
     * Rafik Bouchaala
       Diablo 3, splinter cell black list no where to find on GOnD and not
       GTA V day one download.
       It's funny because MS are the ones speaking the most about a
       "digital future" and always claiming how "live is a better
       service", how it's "worth paying for" yet they lack this VERY
       CONVENIENT feature that pushes interest and acceptance in digital
       sales.
       Knowing that your digital game will be ready to play the moment the
       game is released, ie no waiting on it to download and no waiting in
       line at a midnight launch party. These things help boost the
       incentive in buying digitally without forcing it on people.
       MSs "better service" needs to take notes.
       Timed Full Game Trials is another thing PSN (well PS+ specifically)
       has over Live. No idea what's hold MS up from copying these
       features :/
          + tabicat
            Games are not available via GoD on day one because that would
            piss of Gamestop, and MS can't afford to piss them off. That's
            why the original Xbox One DRM included Gamestop as an
            "authorized buyer" of used games.
               o Rafik Bouchaala
                 anyone who is down voting me is a blind fanboy :P so
                 you're telling me that sony and steam are pissing off
                 gamestop and all the retailers right ?
                    # ungeheier
                      I decided to downvote all your comments just because
                      of the one above. DIAF.
               o GmailIsDown
                 i thought for the Xbox One, everything will be released
                 day one both physical and digital.
                    # usrev
                      you are correct. not sure why they don't have day 1
                      digital on xbox now. it's probably something to do
                      with the marketplace, we know you can't "preorder"
                      things digitally like on ps3 atm. so idk.
               o Dylan
                 Not true, Sony does this all the time.
               o SoulSnatcha
                 How would this piss off GameStop? There is still a want
                 for physical copies of games. We are in the minority with
                 wanting digital copies on day one, so this wouldn't hurt
                 GameStop much at all, at least not for a while. But with
                 the Xbox One, all games will have digital copies on day
                 one. Maybe this policy will include the Xbox 360 as well
                 at some point. Until then, MS still has to wait on the
                 publishers to allow/release digitals.
               o slasaru
                 All gamestops like Sony and praise it all the time
                 Even though Sony publishes on day one and gives for free
                 in PSN+
                 So I see no connection

     * roozbeh, again
       Battlefield 4 next please.
          + Pearson Smith
            EA offers the $10 upgrade for Battlefield but it's through
            select retailers. Disadvantages... physical copy only, can't
            keep your 360 copy, offer ends December 31st, and it's a one
            time transfer of multiplayer stats unlike COD.
            Plus, Playstation is the only system that will let you upgrade
            to a digital copy of BF4. It's all apart of that
            exclusiveness. COD is exclusive to Xbox and BF is exclusive to
            Playstation.
     * EighteenCharacters
       In other words, the price of impatience is exactly $10.
          + BlinkFandango
            Actually it's a couple of hundred if you're picking up a Day
            One console.
               o StudioMultimédia Gon'Interacti
                 couple of hundred ? you really think price is going down

                           i can be patient to wait a few months but i
                           cannot be patient to wait a few years. who
                           knows what could happen in a few years

                           Not enough PS4 games at launch? You are sure
                           you are not mixing PS4 with PS3 back then?
                           PS4 might have a few titles less than Xbone.
                           But far from "no games".. very far.
                         @ GmailIsDown
                           Knack, driveclub, and Lillzone SF. That's it.
                           The rest is cross platform or small psn games
                           that could play just as well on PS3.
                         @ Timothy Hames
                           Look Indies and Small games can be just as good
                           as the Large Triple AAA.
                           GTA 5 is selling like hot cakes but Minecraft
                           has sold more.
                           The Walking Dead is prop the best video game of
                           a generation nothing stands up to the story
                           that it told and it was an indie game.
                           Dont Starve is coming out for PS4 I would not
                           count the indie and small game exp as a
                           subtraction to a system. They make up for a
                           lack of Triple AAA titles.
                           The Xbox has some great games but what will
                           hold you over during the waiting times for
                           Titenfall or Dystany, when Cod, BF, Forza or
                           Ryse become stale/
                           Shoot some of the XBL game like Limbo and
                           Baston are outstanding I dont see great cheap
                           games like that on the horizon for the xbox 1
                           like with the ps4
                         @ Timothy Hames
                           These are the games comfirmed after launch for
                           the Xbox 1 you will need some indies and small
                           games to full in the space or you will end up
                           in place like the Wii U.

                           true, but i don't think a lot of people spend
                           $400~$500 to get a powerful next-gen console
                           with the intention of playing indies, just like
                           not a lot of Wii U owners bought a Wii U on
                           release to play antic ports on Virtual Console,
                           though they eventually caved in as there were
                           not a lot games. Don't Starve is available on
                           PC already, and there is really no point of
                           playing it again on PS4. people want true
                           next-gen games that shows what this shiny new
                           console is made of. i personally would rather
                           to have more exclusive AAA games than a lot
                           more indies/cross-platform games that are
                           available on PC anyway. this is the reason I
                           canceled my PS4 preorder. i'll re-buy it when
                           the Japanese side picks up. they are
                           notoriously slow adapting new technologies.
               o Timothy Hames
                 System Cost /Time played makes it cheaper or same to buy
                 day one vs waiting.
                 (this console cycle is suppose to be 10 years)
                 Lets say like with the 360 after 1 year it comes down
                 50.00.
                 500/10 years = 50 per year
                 450/9 years = 50 per year
                 400/8 years = 50 per year
                 350/7 years = 50 per year
                 300/6 years = 50 per year
                 300/5 years = 60 per year
                 If MS drops the price by 100 within the first year then
                 and only then will it be cheaper, but thats not going to
                 happen if unless sales are slow.
                 In the end it will be about the same.

                      Yeah, but you're not adding in the benefit that by
                      waiting, game prices also drop. So while it might be
                      the same to wait for the system, by waiting you're
                      getting the benefit of having a larger library
                      available at a cheaper price.
                         @ Timothy Hames
                           Look your right on the games. Iam just looking
                           at the consoles.
                           (ps i like to wait about 1 year before i get
                           madden or fifa for that reason alone. Fifa 13
                           is 27.99 used at game stop Halo 4 is 29.99 at
                           the ms store thoses are huge savings.)
                         @ BlinkFandango
                           Sometimes you don't even have to wait that
                           long, I got BF3 a month after it came out for
                           $30 (on Black Friday). I might get Fifa 14 this
                           year if someone sells it cheap from Europe on
                           eBay or something.
                         @ Timothy Hames
                           Fifa 14 is a digital code but your correct on
                           waiting in General but you still need the
                           system to play the games. Seeing that the
                           prices are going to be the same for 360 and 1 I
                           would say get it at launch.
                         @ BlinkFandango
                           Yeah, I'm getting all my games digitally next
                           gen so I can take full advantage of instant
                           switching.
                         @ Timothy Hames
                           But your going to lose out on buy cheaper
                           games, digital games on Xbox tent to cost more
                           or longer.
                         @ BlinkFandango
                           That's the tradeoff: price for convenience,
                           although I'm hoping that:
                           1. MS improves their sales, they have been
                           doing better in the last few years and they are
                           trying to compete with Steam and push digital
                           content, so this is likely.
                           2. Since all games come out day one digitally,
                           I am hoping they drop in price more closely
                           with the physical versions. The problem the 360
                           had was that games usually came out later on
                           digital and were full price even when they were
                           old.
                           3. With this CoD announcement, retailers will
                           be selling digital codes. If the digital does
                           well, retailers will stock more codes and that
                           means I won't just have to buy digital content
                           from the marketplace, I can get it from
                           Gamestop or Amazon, which will probably be
                           cheaper than buying it from MS.

          + GmailIsDown
            that would be great. think about it. it is great for both
            parties. the players end up paying a little bit more ($10) to
            play it on both consoles, with stats and season passes all
            shared. and the publishers end up selling more digital copies
            (that cannot be resold) because the players are more willing
            to buy the games at full price at release, who otherwise will
            get only 1 version and may wait until there is a price drop.

            assuming GTA 5 will come to next gen, it won't be for a while.

            #########################################
            Can you earn two sets of Achievements for the same game (i.e.
            Playing Call of Duty Ghosts on Xbox 360 and on Xbox One)?
            WHITTEN: Every game has its own set of achievements,
            so if you're playing Call of Duty: Ghosts on Xbox 360 and on
            Xbox One,
            you can earn a separate set of Gamerscore in each game. But on
            the Xbox
            One version, you're getting a much richer set of features,
            such as
            seeing your achievements progress on the Xbox One console,
            being able to
            unlock new achievements throughout the year, and earning real
            prizes
            inside and outside of the game. Xbox One also enables a new
            concept of
            challenges, where games will be offering special time-based
            opportunities to earn various goals and collect the rewards.

                 I don't understand what that means. You can see that on
                 the x360.

                      Maybe it goes more in depth like what the xbox

                      Maybe it's something like Gears of War 3/J in-game
                      feature. If an achievement asks you to kill 200
                      enemies, you can check how many enemies you have
                      killed so far.

            The upgrade is useful for those who want to get a jump from

            to worry about starting from scratch when upgrading. If they
            didn't carry over, then I would have to deal with it and wait

                 Good point. We had some pretty good sales the last couple
                 weeks, but BF3 as DotW again is ridiculous!
                    # O Mosqueda
                      Cosmically ridiculous. It's obvious MS wants us to
                      "understand" that the only benefit from being Gold
                      is online gaming. I think I won't renew next month
                      unless a good choice for Games with Gold is offered.
                      The whole idea of the game ahead is interesting but
                      for most it can be stupid. The only scenario from
                      which you could be benefited is that both versions
                      have great differences from each other that could
                      make them worth playing in both versions.

            they should extend this to every game that will be out on both

            they are rentals, and you have to pay $50 a year to keep

            they will stop working once sony ends that program, say a few
            years into PS4's life cycle.

                 Why would you stop paying for PS+ when you get these
                 sorts of games anyway? Who cares if they're free or not.
                 Sony may stop the program but I doubt it with it being so
                 successful and being more value to the customer then what
                 Gold has to offer. ( unless you feel the online service
                 on 360 is worth it )
                 Even if Sony did stop it and you didn't get to keep them,
                 you've still got these games at a steal. It's what?
                 £39.99 a year, and you get hundres of games to "rent".
                 I know I'd rather get "free" games like FC3 and DD:AA and
                 rent them then be forced to pay for gold and get games
                 like Magic 2013 to keep.
                 If Sony continue with this program on PS4 it's only going
                 to be a matter of time before Sony can afford some decent
                 servers and be able to compete with Microsoft, then what
                 does Microsoft have to offer?
                    # Jeremy Filth
                      Ughh...Online? and FREE GAMES.
                    # Jan Václavík
                      Basically Sony is trying to make sure their
                      customers never switch to another console
                      manufacturer, because doing so would make them lose
                      all the "free" games they bought over the years
                      (unless they would continue their subscribe on a
                      past-gen console).
                         @ evilfangs .
                           Why would you ever switch over?
                           If I'm giving you hundreds of games for free or
                           cheaper then any where else why would you ever
                           want to switch over?
                         @ Jan Václavík
                           The same reason people have been switching
                           platforms in the past - better games, new
                           features, friends on another platform etc.
                           As for the price, PC users in particular would
                           strongly disagree - why pay subscription and
                           wait for Sony to let you play budget rentals of
                           their choice (games you may already have or did
                           not bother buying), if you can buy the game you
                           actually want during various sales, humble
                           bundles etc.
          + m1nh0ca
            Well... I have only Xbox, so I don't care about what they have
            (ok, I'm kidding... I care and I'm envy).
            Anyway, the only important thing for me by now is Microsoft
            releasing the region lock from all the games they are offering
            for Gold. C'mon, every month is the same! I was really
            thinking about migrating, but I read I would lose all the
            money I have in my account. I've already lost Dead Rising:
            Case Zero because of this situation... I don't want to lose
            the other games.
          + Timothy Hames
            At first I was like Games with Gold Allright Free games.
            Now I'm like sad panada. Dead rising 2 is outstanding but next
            to Far Cry 3 nope.
     * roozbeh, again
       I'm gonna give a GTA spoiler for you guys, it has nudity
          + evilfangs .
            Hell yeah it does! How this game got past the Australian
            ratings board I never know. GTA 5 in Australia must be a
            completely different game, there is no way this game made it
            100% how Rockstar wanted it.
               o roozbeh, again
                 Would be very wicked if it does have nudity in the
                 Australian version

            Xbox one isn't even out yet, how do you know it is defective?
            Plus if you think Sony is any better, look up the disc reader
            stuff on the PS2
               o Spokker
                 You just turn the PS2 upsidedown.
     * Dennis Crosby
       This is cool but when can I buy GTA5 on Xbox demand
          + Liquidfx Xboxdude
            go to the store and demand a copy and they will deliver. such
            a good game too.
               o GmailIsDown
                 i've heard GTA5 has technical problems on the 360. if you
                 install both discs the performance will actually degrade.
                    # Dylan
                      Installing the second disc severely impairs
                      graphical fidelity.
                      Installing that disc is not a good idea, not game
                      breaking, but it's pretty awful.
                         @ Jan Václavík
                           The boxed version of the game was designed to
                           read from both the game disc and the HDD.
                           Installing the "install" disc on the HDD and
                           the "game" disc on USB drive is said to bypass
                           the performance issues, while avoiding the
                           noise of old DVD drives.
               o slasaru
                 Ahaha, thats hillarious ))
          + Jan Václavík
            Seems like the digital version on PS3 is suffering some
            streaming issues. Getting boxed version may be the best
            option.
     * Nick Peck
       For those that don't see the link in the details part:
       "Introducing the Xbox Game Ahead Program
       Gamers can purchase a disc-less dual-license digital version of
       Call of Duty: Ghosts at participating retailers for a suggested
       retail price of $69.99. This version will include the Xbox 360
       digital version of Call of Duty: Ghosts, as well as the Xbox One
       digital version of Call of Duty: Ghosts - linked and unlocked via a
       user's Xbox Live gamertag. Look for more information on how to
       pre-order at participating retailers in the coming weeks.
       Via the Game Ahead Program, players can also purchase a digital
       version of Call of Duty: Ghosts directly from the Xbox Live
       Marketplace for a suggested retail price of $59.99. And, when ready
       to upgrade to Xbox One, you can purchase a digital Xbox One version
       of Call of Duty: Ghosts for a suggested retail price of just $10 on
       the Xbox Live Marketplace until March 31, 2014."
       I'm happy that you can just do this through XBL as the second
       paragraph suggests because I was just going to buy it via XBL on
       day one anyways. This way I can play it a bit on the 360 and just
       get an XBO version for another $10. Not totally sure I'll do it,
       but its not a bad deal really.
          + m1nh0ca
            Well... now, XOne not being retrocompatible with X360
            absolutely make sense...
            People WILL buy two versions of the SAME game *sigh*
               o Nick Peck
                 Actually you are paying $70 for both games. You can keep
                 the 360 version and then purchase the XBL XBO version for
                 the $10 upgrade cost. Not really a bad deal and will work
                 for me since my daughter is getting my 360 and likes to
                 play CoD. Saves me some money.
                    # Shawn Springer
                      What about the SEASON pass.. Will it be for both
                      consoles or just the one?
                         @ Nick Peck
                           You can preorder it online now and it will
                           transfer from the 360 to the XBO. From how it
                           reads it will work on both but for this I'm not
                           totally positive yet.
     * david_hoyland
       What I want to know is can I still get the freefall pre order map
       if I buy the digital version?
          + surferzero
            No joke. Tons of questions. Such as can we get the on demand
            360 version on release day? How do we know it won't be botched
            like the PSN GTA V release? And do we get the pre-order
            exclusives?
     * moebiouz
       Can someone please explain to me why Australian players are being
       charged $40 more for the same digital version than U.S. players
       please? 66% markup?? c'mon
          + XBOne Vanilla Tears
            UK gets it cheaper than us Americans. It sucks how it's not
            just the same everywhere.
          + Shawn Springer
            It's because of your LAWS IN AUSTRALIA SUCK!!!! They don't
            want the local programers/ developers to get hurt, so they
            charge them a high cost of importing it and it deters people
            from buying it and to buy their local game developer!! Use the
            GOOGLE, or BING.
               o moebiouz
                 Not really. Recently Apple, Adobe & Microsoft were
                 brought before a Government committee to explain pricing
                 differences. Microsoft's reply was basically, "if you
                 don't like it - then go elsewhere". It's called Greed.
               o moebiouz
                 I think you missed my point. There is no physical import
                 involved. I was referring to the digital copy. Which,
                 most likely, will come from the same server.
                    # vSimCO
                      That would be an intellectual import.
     * vivalajam26
       I doubt this will get answered but here goes:
       Will there be a disc-less dual-license digital version (DLV) of
       Battlefield 4? If so can I use the 360 code to obviously download
       it to my current console but if I use the code for the ONE, does
       that make the 360 version not work?
       I'm looking at getting a ONE in June next year after E3, and want
       BF 4 when it comes out. Can I use the 360 version once the One code
       has been downloaded? Is it possible just to have the One version
       sitting in my download history, so when I upgrade it will be there
       ready to download?
     * rkm80
       I'm sure it has been stated before, but the digital version should
       be at least 10 dollars cheaper than the disc based version.
     * Shawn Springer
       Or just wait, LIKE A BOSS!
     * rrcplus
       10 dollars? And the equivalent of 10 dollars in other countries? Or
       10 eur($13.52) and 10 pounds ($16)?
