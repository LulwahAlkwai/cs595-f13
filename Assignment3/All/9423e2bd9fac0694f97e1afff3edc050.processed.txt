We are not who we are

   Posted on [16]2013/01/14 | [17]8 Comments

   In authentication, we generally talk about three "factors" for
   determining identity. A "factor" is a broad category for establishing
   that you are who you claim to be. The three types of authentication
   factor are:
     * Something you know (a password, a PIN, the answer to a "security
       question", etc.)
     * Something you have (an ATM card, a smart card, a one-time-password
       token, etc.)
     * Something you are (your fingerprint, retinal pattern, DNA)

   Historically, most people have used the first of these three forms most
   commonly. Whenever you've logged into Facebook, you're entering
   something you know: your username and password. If you've ever used
   Google's two-factor authentication to log in, you probably used a code
   stored on your smartphone to do so.

   One of the less common, but growing, authentication methods are the
   biometrics. A couple years ago, a major PC manufacturer ran a number of
   television commercials advertising their laptop models with a
   fingerprint scanner. The claim was that it was easy and secure to
   unlock the machine with a swipe of a finger. Similarly, Google
   introduced a service to unlock an Android smart phone by using facial
   recognition with the built-in camera.

   Pay attention folks, because I'm about to remove the scales from your
   eyes. Those three factors I listed above? I listed them in decreasing
   order of security. "But how can that be?" you may ask. "How can my
   unchangeable physical attributes be less secure than a password?
   Everyone knows passwords aren't secure."

   The confusion here is due to subtle but important definitions in the
   meaning of "security". Most common passwords these days are considered
   "insecure" because people tend to use short passwords which by
   definition have a limited entropy pool (meaning it takes a smaller
   amount of time to run through all the possible combinations in order to
   brute-force the password or run through a password dictionary).
   However, the pure computational complexity of the authentication
   mechanism is not the only contributor to security.

   The second factor above, "something you have" (known as a token), is
   almost always of significantly higher entropy than anything you would
   ever use as a password. This is to eliminate the brute-force
   vulnerability of passwords. But it comes with a significant downside as
   well: something you have is also something that can be physically
   removed from you. Where a well-chosen password can only be removed from
   you by social engineering (tricking you into giving it to an
   inappropriate recipient), a token might be slipped off your desk while
   you are at lunch.

   Both passwords and tokens have an important side-effect that most
   people never think about until an intrusion has been caught:
   remediation. When someone has successfully learned your password or
   stolen your token, you can call up your helpdesk and immediately ask
   them to reset the password or disable the cryptographic seed in the
   token. Your security is now restored and you can choose a new password
   and have a new token sent to you.

   However, this is not the case with a biometric system. By its very
   nature, it is dependent upon something that you cannot change.
   Moreover, the nature of its supposed security derives from this very
   fact. The problem here is that it's significantly easier to acquire a
   copy of someone's fingerprint, retinal scan or even blood for a DNA
   test than it is to steal a password or token device and in many cases
   it can even be done without the victim knowing.

   Many consumer retinal scanners can be fooled by a simple
   reasonably-high-resolution photograph of the person's eye (which is
   extremely easy to accomplish with today's cameras). Some of the more
   expensive models will also require a moving picture, but today's
   high-resolution smartphone cameras and displays can defeat many of
   these mechanisms as well. It's well-documented that Android's
   face-unlock feature can be beaten by a simple photograph.

   These are all technological limitations and as such it's plausible that
   they can be overcome over time with more sensitive equipment. However,
   the real problem with biometric security lies with its inability to
   replace a compromised authentication device. Once someone has a copy of
   your ten fingerprints, or a drop of your blood from a stolen
   blood-sugar test or a close-up video of your eye from a scoped video
   camera, there is no way to change this data out. You can't ask helpdesk
   to send you new fingers, an eyeball or DNA. Therefore, I contend that I
   lied to you above. There is no full third factor for authentication,
   because, given a sufficient amount of time, any use of biometrics will
   eventually degenerate into a non-factor.

   Given this serious limitation, one should never under any circumstances
   use biometrics as the sole form of authentication for any purpose
   whatsoever.

   One other thought: have you ever heard the argument that you should
   never use the same password on multiple websites because if it's stolen
   on one, they have access to the others? Well, the same is true of your
   retina. If someone sticks malware on your cellphone to copy an image of
   your eye that you were using for "face unlock", guess what? They can
   probably use that to get into your lab too.

   The moral of the story is this: biometrics are minimally useful, since
   they are only viable until the first exposure across all sites where
   they are used. As a result, if you are considering initiating a
   biometric-based security model, I encourage you to save your money
   (those scanners are expensive!) and look into a two-factor solution
   involving passwords and a token of some kind.

       Agreed, with a caveat -- biometric readers can be useful in a
       supervised-entry environment. You can pay someone minimum wage
       salary to sit behind a thick glass and make sure that whenever
       someone uses a retina scan, they actually put their eyes to the
       scanner instead of whipping out a smartphone.

            So that solves things until someone comes up with a way to
            overlay a retinal photo on your eye using a trick contact
            lens. This has either already happened but is not yet in the
            public domain, or will happen soon, I'd bet.

       While biometrics won't work well for a preventative authentication
       measure, they can still provide a benefit for auditing and tracking
       compromised systems. Now, whether that's enough of a perk to
       justify biometric equipments' cost is a different issue. There are
       some targets that would reasonably require as many layers of
       authentication as possible.
       Basically, having "What you are" alongside "What you know" and
       "What you have" basically adds another dimension to any given
       security system.
          + [34]sgallagh | [35]2013/01/14 at 6:37 PM | [36]Reply
            Sure, it adds another dimension and I can see where it might
            help with auditing and tracking (or at least understanding the
            depth of the attack). However I think my point was valid: once
            a biometric factor has been compromised, it is compromised for
            ALL authentication systems that use it, related or not. You
            can't go out and buy new fingers, unless you're planning to
            have plastic surgery on a regular basis (in which point, we're
            now actually talking about "something you have" rather than
            "something you are").
            I also neglected to mention the more terrifying side of
            biometric-only access: someone with an urgent need to break in
            can compel you physically much more easily than mentally.
            Holding a gun to your head and making you put your hand on a
            palm-print scanner (or removing your hand from you and doing
            it themselves) may require less effort than attempting to
            compel you to give up your passwords (and has the side-effect
            that you can't lie about them).
            With all that in mind, I stand by my conclusions (though they
            are my own opinion) that biometrics introduce more risks than
            they alleviate and therefore are inappropriate in a security
            context. Furthermore, given the problems with remediation,
            investing in biometric sensor development will not yield good
            returns in the long-term. No matter what, biometrics will
            *always* be a fuzzy-logic game, and any such system can be
            gamed.
