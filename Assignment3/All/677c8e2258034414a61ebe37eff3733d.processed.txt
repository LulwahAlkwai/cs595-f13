Resurrecting dinosaurs will remain a Jurassic Park dream

Contrary to earlier reports, DNA doesn't survive even decades in tree sap.

   On the same day that the [9]latest installment of the Jurassic Park
   film series has been confirmed, a study published in [10]PLOS One has
   detailed experiments that seem to demonstrate once and for all that
   dinosaurs will never again walk the Earth.

   The 1993 [11]film, based on a [12]book by Michael Crichton, depicts a
   theme park island filled with dinosaurs, resurrected from ancient DNA
   extracted from fossilized mosquitoes trapped in amber. For a while,
   that science didn't seem to be entirely fiction. In the early 1990s,
   several scientists announced they had [13]extracted DNA from insects
   fossilized in amber as long as 130 million years ago. Insects from this
   time in Earth's history, the early Cretaceous period, would have flown
   among dinosaurs (including giant, long-necked sauropods, among the
   largest creatures ever on land) as well as creatures such as flying
   pterosaurs, swimming plesiosaurs, feathered birds, and mammals.

   This Lebanese amber was until recently the oldest in the world, older
   than the more common Dominican amber, which formed around 16 million
   years ago and the 49-million-year-old amber of the Baltic. But last
   year, tiny mites were found for the first time in amber [14]dating from
   the Triassic period--230 million years ago.

   While the premise of the film--that dinosaur DNA could be extracted
   from the guts of a preserved mosquito that had recently dined on
   one--seems reasonable, the fragile nature of DNA and the huge expanse
   of time that has passed have led many experts to doubt claims to have
   extracted any DNA that old--including DNA from the insect itself.

   David Penney, a palaeontologist and expert in amber-preserved spiders
   and insects at the University of Manchester, carried out experiments to
   try to confirm once and for all whether DNA could be extracted from
   creatures fossilized in amber. With Terry Brown, an ancient-DNA expert
   also at the University of Manchester, they used the latest "next
   generation" DNA extraction and sampling techniques to avoid DNA
   contamination.

   "We used Manchester's specialized, dedicated laboratories that are only
   used for analyzing ancient DNA," Penney said. "Any DNA traces will be
   tiny pieces of ancient, fragmented material, so it's important to avoid
   contamination with modern DNA." The laboratories are sterilized, the
   air filtered, and scientists wear full-body decontamination suits.

   The specimens from which scientists claimed to have successfully
   extracted DNA were of stingless bees, and Penney used examples of the
   same species. One was about 10,600 years old, the second was preserved
   just after World War II--only about 60 years ago. Both samples were
   extracted from copal, a hardened form of tree sap that had encased the
   insects; it's an intermediate stage that had not fully fossilized into
   amber. Chemicals were used to dissolve away the copal before samples
   were taken from the creature held inside.

   The results were pretty conclusive: "In the oldest specimen we found no
   viable DNA," Penney said. "In the newer sample, we found various
   bacterial and other DNA, but nothing that was certifiably from the
   bee."

   Brown explained that an older technique known as PCR was used in the
   1990s experiments, and it may have caused problems: "The process,
   called polymerase chain reaction, will preferentially amplify any
   modern, undamaged DNA molecules that contaminate an extract of
   partially degraded ancient ones and give false positive results that
   might be mistaken for genuine, ancient DNA."

   The process of [15]fossilization, whether in rock or amber, chemically
   changes the makeup of the organism it preserves. Over time, with heat
   and pressure, the remains are transformed, and they no longer contain
   the organic material that might harbor DNA.

   If viable DNA cannot be extracted from a bee that is only as old as
   someone living today, there is no chance that it could be obtained from
   specimens hundreds of millions of years old. But that doesn't mean the
   amber samples are useless.

   "The preservation of these creatures in amber is remarkable, and they
   give us an insight into the past and can shed light on the possible
   future of the tropical forests of today," Penney said."I suppose it's a
   bit of a shame that we can't extract DNA from these creatures--I was
   even expecting to find some in the younger specimen--but it seems
   Jurassic Park must remain in the realms of fiction."
