   window. Positioning their product as the real next big thing and the
   iPhone 5S as an out of date, out of step, design Samsung continues to
   out fund and out execute Apple in ads. The real irony here is this was
   always thought to be Steve Jobs strength against Microsoft and suddenly
   you see Samsung, and with some irony, Microsoft showcasing this skill
   while Apple seems unable to counter. It isn't that they brought a knife
   to a gunfight it is as if they simply don't know how to fight. Story in
