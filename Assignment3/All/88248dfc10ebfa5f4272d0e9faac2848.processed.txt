   Microsoft/Nokia: Assured Success or Formula for Disaster, Ballmer's
   hidden brilliance.
   Steve Ballmer has actually done something rather brilliant with the
   process he used to acquire Nokia. Much of the risk and cost of the
   merger was eliminated before the merger was announced brining the
   overall cost down to something Microsoft could afford and reducing the
   risk of not ending up with something he could use to virtually nothing.
   If you start the acquisition process when Elop took over the company
   you see a very different and far more interesting process than if you
   start it when they actually announced the merger. This may be a new
   best practice for how to acquire a very large company, particularly one
   in Europe. Had they not used this process, Microsoft likely wouldn't
   have been able to afford Nokia and, even if they could, the outcome
   would have been at much higher risk. This is the focus of my
   ITBusinessEdge post this week:
