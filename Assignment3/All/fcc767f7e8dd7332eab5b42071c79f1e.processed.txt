Your Tiny Roommates: Meet the Microbes Living in Your Home

   Every home you've ever lived in has had a population in the
   billions--and in many cases, that's a good thing

   There's no such thing as living alone. Never mind if you're the only
   person in your house and have no dog, no cat, not even fish. You've
   still got at least several billion roommates--and so do we all. Some of
   them are harmless, some are actually helpful and some could, in the
   right concentration and the wrong circumstance, kill you. They are, of
   course, bacteria, fungi and viruses, and like it or not, they're on
   you, around you and deeply within you.

   The fact that bacterial life is everywhere is not surprising. It's
   something you learned practically from babyhood, every time your mom
   told you not to drink out of someone else's glass during flu season.
   But when mothers say everywhere, even they don't  know the full meaning
   of that word. There are the thriving bacteria more commonly found in
   hot springs that are living in your tea kettle, perhaps migrating to
   you through the water supply and settling down in the steamiest place
   possible. There are the underarm bacteria living atop your door frame.
   And yes, there are the fecal bacteria (maybe not yours) sleeping with
   you on your pillowcase. Sit with that one for a while.

   Increasingly, scientists are coming to appreciate the richness of
   what's known as the microbiome, a microscopic--or, in the case of
   viruses, submicroscopic--ecosystem every bit as complex as the ones
   found in oceans, rainforests, deserts and woodlands. Your house has a
   microbiome and so do you. Up to 90% of the cells in your body are
   organisms that come from outside, though that population represents at
   most a few pounds of your mass. (Guest cells are much smaller than your
   own.)

   (MORE: [62]Experts Say Arsenic levels in Rice Are Safe--For Now)

   None of that is necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, much of the time it's
   a very good thing. Gut bacteria living in harmony with you can fortify
   your immune system, help you digest your food, protect you from certain
   diseases. We need our billions of houseguests, but it would be nice if
   we could at least get to know them better. To that end, investigators
   like Rob Dunn, a biologist at [63]North Carolina State University and
   head of a project called the Wild Life of Your Home, have taken to
   conducting microbial expeditions through people's houses and
   apartments, trying to discover new life forms, identify familiar ones,
   and figure out which ones live in which niches and why.  Eventually,
   he'd also like to learn how each species of bacterium affects
   us--interacting with our own microbial ecosystems and perhaps even
   joining them in our innards. (Disclosure: I contributed an article to
   Dunn's educational website on household microbes, for which I was
   paid.) In early 2012, I asked Dunn if he would take a census of my
   household, in Brooklyn, [64]New York.

   The sampling kit I received in the mail contained sterile cotton swabs
   to wipe over six regions, selected because Dunn and his collaborators
   suspected they would represent several different ecosystems: my
   computer screen, front door knob, inner doorframe, toilet seat, kitchen
   counter, and pillowcase. I filled out a questionnaire about myself and
   my habits, including the cleaning chemicals I use and any allergies I
   might have. Then I ran the cotton swabs over the specified regions and
   sent the samples, sealed in plastic vials, to North Carolina.

   It took a year before I got my results. (Dunn does a lot of sampling
   and identifying all the species collected by any one swab can be
   painstaking work.) The spreadsheet the lab sent me listed more than
   1,400 different bacteria, identified by their DNA, and the team
   arranged the names to display the inhabitants of three places
   representing the three most common household ecosystems: the kitchen
   counter (an IKEA butcher block), the doorframe, and the pillowcase.

   (MORE: [65]200,000 Lives Could Be Saved From Heart Disease Each Year)

   On the doorframe, the most abundant bacterial DNA came, surprisingly,
   from plants. Chloroplasts, the structures that allow plants to draw
   energy from photosynthesis, were originally free-floating cyanobacteria
   that took up residence in plant cells, and the cyanobacteria DNA strewn
   around my apartment are a signature of pollen. I have a slightly
   heavier pollen load than most, perhaps because of my proximity to
   Prospect Park, less than a block away.

   The other prominent citizens of my door frame, probably having settled
   there after floating through the air like the pollen, are skin
   bacteria, including many from the genus Corynebacterium, which includes
   the diphtheria bacterium. There are also some from the genus that
   includes the underarm microbes responsible for body odor. In general,
   the frame's trend towards skin bacteria is characteristic of
   apartments, while houses tend to have more soil there. "In apartments
   you're losing a lot of this stuff that you would see in a house," says
   Dunn, "a lot of the soil stuff goes away, and in some cases it really
   becomes this whole world dominated by the stuff that falls off of us."

   My pillow, to my delight, was statistically distinguishable from a
   toilet seat--which is to say skin bacteria outweigh gut, or fecal,
   bacteria there. But that was by no means a sure thing. Fecal microbes
   are everywhere, constantly spreading from our nether regions--perhaps
   carried on our hands, but also perhaps by themselves, since clothes are
   not a microbe-tight barrier. The ones on my pillow may not even be
   mine: "You touch the fecal bacteria of strangers ALL THE TIME," wrote
   Dunn in an email, with unsettlingly capitalized emphasis. "And so long
   as you aren't talking about pathogens, that isn't actually a big deal."

   (MORE: [66]Women Living Longer Worldwide)

   On the butcher block, 40% of the bacteria are associated with plants or
   produce, which puts me in about the normal range for the kitchen
   counters the team has looked at so far. The most intriguing find there
   was something called Hydrocarboniphaga effusa. When I search for it, I
   turn up a 2004 paper announcing the discovery of this bacterium not too
   far from where I live, in soil contaminated by a fuel [67]oil leak in
   New Jersey, where it was happily digesting the spill. What it was
   eating at my house is not clear. Perhaps it stowed away on a
   fossil-fuel-based substance, a fertilizer or a pesticide that was
   contaminating produce I brought in.

   Of all the houses the team has so far examined, about 40, I am the only
   person with H. effusa around. But outlier homes like mine--with a
   bacterium no one else seems to have--are not unusual. They're actually
   very, very common, Dunn says. It's in the nature of microbes that some
   sneak in unexplained; a different flavor for everyone.

   As creepily fascinating as it is to discover just which microorganisms
   are living in our homes, there is also hard, perhaps even lifesaving
   science that can come from it. Our immune systems are highly evolved
   bacteria-killing machines, but often, we can forge a mutually
   beneficial truce with the microbes that invade us. Studies have shown
   that people with Crohn's disease, for example, have less-diverse gut
   bacteria than controls, and that mice lacking gut bacteria have higher
   rates of autoimmune diseases and more immune cells in certain tissues
   than controls. Biologists hypothesize that the microbes that colonize
   us might train and toughen the immune system, and in the absence of the
   right complement of them, autoimmune diseases develop. How each of us
   acquires our own microbiome--and what the right mix of microbes is--is
   a subject of much research. Young children's systems get microbial
   infusions right from the start, even during birth, when they receive a
   good dose of the mother's vaginal microbes, provided they're not born
   by Cesarean section. Breast milk is another way of taking in both the
   germs and antibodies mom is carrying. If this were bad, we'd have
   evolved a different way.

   None of that means you want the rhinovirus a sniffling guest left on
   your doorknob, the pathogenic e. coli you picked up in a restroom, the
   salmonella that found its way to your kitchen counter from a package of
   not-quite-right chicken. It does mean that you live in at least a
   semi-permeable world, with tiny critters you've never heard of--and
   perhaps science hasn't heard of either--passing onto you, into you and
   out of you all the time. The better we understand them, the better
   we'll know which ones to ignore, which ones to avoid and, more often
   than we think, which ones to welcome.

   Interesting article.  Just a detail - there is in fact evidence to
   suggest that even before birth, human fetuses are building a
   microbiome.  Carl Zimmer wrote on it recently:

   ""You touch the fecal bacteria of strangers ALL THE TIME," wrote Dunn
   in an email..."

   This explains why I've been taking so much crap from people at work.
