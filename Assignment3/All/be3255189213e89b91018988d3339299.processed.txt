[57]Dinosaurs in flight: the movie

   By [58]Carl Zimmer | October 24, 2011 4:15 pm

   Earlier this year in National Geographic, I [59]wrote about how
   feathers evolved long before flight. This timing naturally raises the
   question, how did feathered dinosaurs take to the air?  My article was
   accompanied by a picture from the University of Montana lab of [60]Ken
   Dial, who argues that before dinosaurs flew, they flapped their wings
   to help them travel up and down inclines. While not all experts accept
   Dial's hypothesis, it has the undeniable strength that he can gather
   evidence for it in living birds, rather than just inferring behavior
   from fossils alone.

   This video shows some of the astonishing climbs birds can make with the
   help of some wing flapping. It's a mix of lab climbs and footage from
   the wild, with an evolutionary tree of birds.

   [EMBED]

   This is a skill that takes time for birds to develop, as shown in this
   video below. Dinosaurs might have gradually acquired the skill as well,
   as their arms evolved into more bird-like wings.

   Dial argues that this flapping would also help on the way down, too.
   Here's a young bird leaping to the ground, and flapping its wings to
   control its fall.

   By the time dinosaurs had evolved the ability to use feathers to assist
   in climbs, they would have already developed the wing stroke used by
   birds today for true flight, as this video shows.

   Even without full flight, Dial argues, flapping feathered wings would
   have given little feathered dinosaurs the boost they needed to escape
   hungry predators. And this behavior could have served as an
   evolutionary bridge from the land to the air.

       Ken Dial's work on WAIR is fantastic. It has become fundamental in
       discussions about avian flight origins. Ken also gives some of the
       best scientific presentations I have ever seen; one of his talks at
       the Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology was so
       spectacular that he was given a standing ovation.
       All that said, I happen to be one of the scientists who is
       skeptical of the role of WAIR, specifically, in the origin of
       flight. It is likely that early birds and/or bird-like dinosaurs
       (basal avialans, to those familiar with the jargon) did not possess
       an upstroke with the proper kinematic range to allow a WAIR ascent
       (this would issues related to angle of attack, direction of lift,
       and mitigation of vorticity delay, otherwise known as the "Wagner
       Effect").
       Still, the work by Dial et al. is a shining example of how the
       aerodynamic forces produced by wings can be used for mobility
       functions other than flight. This alternative usage model, in a
       general sense, is being increasingly accepted as a fundamental part
       of the origin and early evolution of avian flight.

       I presume you've seen the study about adding flapping wings to a
       robot helps it run faster and stabilizes it.

       To have wings is better than not to have, even for robots ;-) :

       For anyone who, like me, may be somewhere where videos are blocked
       and don't know what Michael Habib means by `WAIR', it expands to
       `wing-assisted incline running'.

       Why in the world would anyone doubt that wings are useful even if
       they are incapable of flight? I live with a parrot, and when she
       was young I had her wings clipped so that she could not fly. She
       still used them for climbing inclines all the time. As she got
       older and gained more experience, I let her feathers grow out and
       she has been fully flighted for some time. She *still* uses her
       wings to assist climbing all the time! I guess none of these
       scientists have ever lived with a bird?
       Oh, by the way, with the assist of wing-flapping, my parrot can
       climb a vertical wooden dowel.
       (Granted, observing how modern birds use their wings does not prove
       how their pre-flight ancestors used their wings. Also, I do not
       live with a flightless bird, but there *are* flightless parrots and
       I'd bet good money that they also use their wings to assist
       climbing. Anybody know for sure?)
