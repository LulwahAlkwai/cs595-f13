[4]Share your software early: the Reinhart-Rogoff case

   I like stories where prestigious professors screw up spectacularly. It
   reminds us that everybody gets it wrong some of the time. The
   Reinhart-Rogoff story is one such case.

   Two very reputed professors at Harvard University, Carmen Reinhart and
   Kenneth Rogoff, published online a working paper in 2010 called
   [5]Growth in a time of debt. The paper has since been cited in the
   scientific literature about 500 times, or about once every two days.
   They later wrote a [6]best-seller book on the same topic. They built a
   web site to promote their ideas where [7]they shared some of their
   data.

   Their research paper is remarkably easy to understand: countries with
   large debt tend to have lesser economic growth. This claim is entirely
   credible. On the one hand, countries with poor economies may tend to
   grow large debts because they have weak revenues. On the other hand,
   large debts may lead to tight fiscal policies (e.g., high taxes) or lax
   monetary policies (e.g., printing money) that may reduce economic
   growth.

   The part that is less credible is that Reinhart and Rogoff were able to
   find a magical threshold (debt-to-GDP ratio of 0.9) that triggered low
   growth. In effect, they implicitly claimed that any debt-to-GDP ratio
   in excess of 0.9 would reduce your economic growth. This gave
   politicians a scientific justification for austerity measures (e.g.,
   raising taxes and cutting back on government services).

   The story then becomes interesting. Thomas Herndon, a graduate student,
   grabbed data from the Reinhart-Rogoff web site and tried to reproduce
   their results. He couldn't. He then asked the authors for help.
   Reinhart and Rogoff shared the [8]Excel spreadsheet they used with
   Herndon. He then promptly found basic flaws in their data processing.
   For example, the two professors ran sums over the wrong cells. It seems
   that they made several odd choices when processing the data. His paper
   is [9]freely available online.

   Things took a turn for the worse when, faced with this opposition,
   [10]Reinhart-Rogoff balked and asserted that these errors did not
   impact their work. Thankfully, they did not deny their mistakes.

   This whole incident shows the importance of sharing data and software.
   Reinhart and Rogoff were almost exemplary regarding data in this case:
   they widely shared their data. Their mistake was in not widely
   distributing their software (in the form a spreadsheet) earlier. Had
   the spreadsheet been available from the start, they would be in a much
   better position.

   Of course, another version of the story could be that, had Reinhart and
   Rogoff not shared their data and software, they would have plausible
   deniability and their work could still be credible. But this only means
   that you, as a reader, should put more trust in work where the data and
   software are available.

   In any case, by keeping the software private, the best that Reinhart
   and Rogoff could have hoped for was to delay the inevitable: once your
   work is the basis for public policy, it is bound to come under intense
   scrutiny and significant mistakes will be discovered. By sharing your
   software, you establish your good faith.

   There are other minor points that I find interesting in this story:
     * All this work is posted online. To my knowledge, no journal has
       been directly involved.
     * Usually, negative results are unpublishable: journals are not
       interested. It is unclear that the paper by Herndon et al. can be
       published in a conventional journal even though it is obviously
       important work.
     * It seems that Reinhart and Rogoff are credited for much of the
       suffering due to the austerity measures in Europe. This seems
       entirely ridiculous to me. I think that Reinhart and Rogoff acted
       in good faith.

    1. "I think that Reinhart and Rogoff acted in good faith" is an
       interesting statement, and quite possibly true.
       But how did the (certainly correct) analysis that "large debts may
       lead to tight fiscal policies that may reduce economic growth" lead
       to the (I think clearly absurd) conclusion that artificially
       pushing the number below the magic threshold (by enacting exactly
       those harmful policies) would solve the problem?

    2. @Jens
       There is nothing in their paper to support the thesis that
       austerity will boost a floundering economy.
       This is maybe what Reinhart and Rogoff believe and advocate but, as
       far as I can tell, this is not what they wrote in their research.

    3. This is a classic case of confirmation bias. The start from a
       position that they want to prove, and find the data accomodating.
       You even demonstrate the bias in your description of the work, with
       statements like "entirely credible". How do we know? Now that the
       specific methodology has been proven flawed, do we really know that
       larger debt equals poorer growth? Is there any statistical
       correlation at all? Is there a correlation between limits? Perhaps
       debt to GDP is a factor, but it could be dwarfed by other more
       significant factors or local norms.
       In Canada's case (for example), we could carry a high debt ratio
       but do well if commodity (oil, iron, aluminium, potash, wheat,
       lumber) prices are high. Whereas we could have poor growth if we
       have no debt but commodity prices are very low.
       The bottom line here is that while I agree in a general way that
       servicing debt has a cost, each circumstance has to be weighed in
       its context. In some cases debt may be important - even crippling.
       In others - it may be a useful tool to attain other factors which
       will create positive growth - which may in turn wipe out debt. This
       is something the Clinton administration was ceanly aware of. Look
       at economic performance and debt ratios in those terms. Clinton
       used growth to slay debt, not the other way round.

    4. It's a great case study in scientific journalism. From what I've
       read, it doesn't sound like the excel error significantly changes
       the results. What does make a large difference is R&R's decision to
       exclude data for some countries in the years following WWII, and an
       unusual weighting scheme that doesn't take time spent in a debt
       category into account (so 19 years of high UK debt and moderate
       growth count the same as the 1 year New Zealand experienced high
       debt and low growth).
       So the issues that really skewed the results are questions of data
       appropriateness/cherry picking, and how to account for serial
       correlations between years. If the formula had been correct, the
       actual issues with the data would have been the same, but the
       public would never have cared. This would have been debated in
       esoteric journals. Instead, because an unrelated but relatable and
       unambiguous error was also there, the narrative is that the paper
       is fundamentally incorrect.
       I guess the lesson is, if you're going to screw up, screw up in a
       boring academic manner =)

    5. I'm really wondering why everyone is so upset against the original
       authors: so they did a mistake, their reasoning was flawed by all
       those errors in their spreadsheet, ok. It remains that the ones to
       blame are those who used those results as a basis for their policy
       and claimed their decisions were sound because some scientists said
       so.
       It's called Argument from authority and it's the first trick taught
       in Rhetoric 101. Or whatever it was called by the ancient greeks.
