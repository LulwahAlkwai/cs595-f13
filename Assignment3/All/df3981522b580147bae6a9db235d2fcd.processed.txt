   The first barrage of winged-woman [48]Emmy statuettes were handed out
   at the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy on Sept. 15 (airing on FXX on Sept.
   21), and [49]Netflix won the night's first one for House of Cards in
   the Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series category.

   The video-streaming service's hit political drama -- up for nine
   Primetime Emmys this season -- beat out Downton Abbey, Game of Thrones,
   Homeland and The Good Wife.

   This is Netflix's first Primetime Creative Arts Emmy; Netflix
   previously snagged two engineering Emmys, Netflix confirmed to
   Mashable. Held a week before the [51]65th Primetime Emmy Awards, the
   Creative Arts ceremony honors behind-the-scenes achievements.

   Casting directors Laray Mayfield and Julie Schubert are credited for
   the win. The cast includes Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright, Kate Mara, Corey
   Stoll, Michael Kelly, Sakina Jaffrey, Kristen Connolly and Constance
   Zimmer.

   Update: Netflix also won for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single
   Camera Series for a Drama, defeating Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and
   Mad Men.

   "We are so proud that both Casting and Cinematography were recognized
   with these historic Emmy wins for House of Cards and Netflix," Ted
   Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, said in a statement. "Laray
   Mayfield, Julie Schubert abd Eigil Bryld's work was truly exquisite,
   and the Academy's acknowledgement for their work is richly deserved."

   For next week's Primetime Emmys, the Academy of Television Arts &
   Sciences has pit Netflix against the traditional TV players in many
   categories (see list below). [52]Netflix made history this year when
   the television academy nominated for the first time ever an original
   series hosted online instead of on cable or network TV.

   The Creative Arts Emmys is being taped today but will air Sept. 21 at 9
   p.m. ET. The Primetime Emmys air live Sept. 22 at 8 p.m. ET on [53]CBS
   from the Nokia Theatre in L.A.
