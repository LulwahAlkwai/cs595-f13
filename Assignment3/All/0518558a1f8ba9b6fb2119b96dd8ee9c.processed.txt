   Xiaomi Launches the Coolest Phone You Probably Won't be Able to Buy.
   The Tegra 4 (yep 4) powered me-3.
   Xiaomi is kind of the Apple/Amazon of China when it comes to phones.
   Like Apple hey pull huge crowds of fans at their launches and their
   phones are structured like Amazon Kindles, they are sold as the razors
   to the app and ad blades. Their products are high style and often
   technology showcases, their latest phone the mi-3 is the first to ship
   with Tegra 4 providing an amazing level of performance in a phone (it
   was believed by many that the first Tegra 4 devices wouldn't show up
   until 2014). It is really starting to get annoying that some of the
   coolest products are China market only. Video of device here:
