   From Academy Award-nominated director Richard E. Robbins and the
   award-winning producers of The Documentary Group and Vulcan
   Productions, strategic partner, Intel Corporation, and distribution
   partners CNN Films and Gathr, comes Girl Rising - an innovative new
   feature film about the power of education to change a girl - and the
   world. Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Selena
   Gomez and other A-list actresses contribute voice performances to the
   film, which features original music from Academy Award winner Rachel
   Portman, in collaboration with Lorne Balfe.
   The film spotlights unforgettable girls like Sokha, an orphan who rises
   from the dumps of Cambodia to become a star student and an accomplished
   dancer; Suma, who composes music to help her endure forced servitude in
   Nepal and today crusades to free others; and Ruksana, an Indian
   "pavement-dweller" whose father sacrifices his own basic needs for his
   daughter's dreams. Each girl is paired with a renowned writer from her
   native country. Edwidge Danticat, Sooni Taraporevala, Aminatta Forna,
   and others tell the girls' stories, each with its own style, and all
   with profound resonance.
   These girls are each unique, but the obstacles they faced are
   ubiquitous. Like the 66 million girls around the world who dream of
   going to school, what Sokha, Suma, Ruksana and the rest want most is to
   be students: to learn. And now, by sharing their personal journeys,
   they have become teachers. Watch Girl Rising, and you will see: One
   girl with courage is a revolution.
