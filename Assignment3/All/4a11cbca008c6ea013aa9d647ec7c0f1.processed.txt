   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   The Marginal Gain from Cisco's Market Expansions Don't Cover the Costs
   You could file this also under "Cisco Needs a New CEO". As Cisco
   continues to expend into areas covered by partners the cost of
   switching a partner to a competitor has equaled or exceeded the benefit
   of moving into the new market which is largely why Cisco's valuation
   has remained largely flat. Microsoft just pushed Steve Ballmer out for
   similar performance. But the point is that firms that have broad
   partnerships like Cisco does often take the partners for granted and
   lust after their margins and revenues. Sounds like this should be the
   11 commandment, "thou shalt not lust after partner's assets" or some
   such. Chris Preimesberger takes this on for eWeek this week:
