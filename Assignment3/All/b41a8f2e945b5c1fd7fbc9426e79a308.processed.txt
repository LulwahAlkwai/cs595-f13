   One thing that we've made clear over the last few months, beginning
   with [24]TechEd North America, [25]TechEd Europe, [26]WPC and in
   conversations with customers: Windows 8.1 is designed with businesses
   in mind. Windows 8.1 Enterprise RTM comes with a host of [27]new
   capabilities only available in the Enterprise edition, as well as new
   industry-leading [28]security features.

   Beginning today, [29]TechNet and [30]MSDN subscribers will now have
   access to Windows 8.1 Enterprise RTM. This also includes access for
   Volume License (VL) customers with an active Software Assurance (SA)
   agreement, as you receive a TechNet subscription as part of SA.

   Preparing Your Organization to Migrate to Windows 8.1 Enterprise

   As we mentioned when we originally announced [31]RTM back in late
   August, we talked about how we are moving forward with a rapid release
   cycle for Windows. If you have not started, begin your Windows 8.1
   planning today. We encourage you to evaluate Windows 8.1 RTM bits to
   get a jump start on your deployment planning, using it with the [32]new
   deployment tools that are already available to create a
   fully-functional model of the deployment processes that you will use
   once Windows 8.1 Enterprise is generally available on October 18*.

   As my colleague Steve Guggenheimer [33]shared this past week, the
   primary objective in making Windows 8.1 RTM bits available on TechNet
   and MSDN is so developers and businesses can continue testing the
   latest version of the operating system as our engineering teams refine
   and update the product and tools in preparation for Windows 8.1 general
   availability. And once GA bits are available, you will be ready to
   conduct final testing and begin your deployment of Windows 8.1. Testing
   your operating system for compatibility with existing applications and
   better understanding what needs to be done to migrate your business -
   especially for those organizations still on Windows XP - is paramount.

   Businesses that are still running Windows XP [34]need to accelerate
   testing and migration to a modern operating system - like Windows 7 or
   Windows 8.1 - as soon as possible before end of support occurs on April
   8, 2014. If you are currently deploying Windows 7, begin evaluating
   Windows 8.1 for all devices, including touch and mouse and keyboard
   options.

   As business customers evaluate versions of Windows 8.1, we've [35]just
   posted an updated feature grid comparing the Windows 8.1 Pro and
   Enterprise SKUs for reference as you're evaluating Windows 8.1 for your
   business. That said, we strongly encourage business customers to
   evaluate Windows 8.1 Enterprise, which supports the premium features
   designed to address the mobile productivity, security, manageability
   and virtualization needs of enterprises. For all devices currently
   running Windows 8 and for those of you who are testing Windows 8.1, use
   Windows 8.1 Enterprise RTM as another opportunity to evaluate the
   operating system so you can start your official migration when Windows
   8.1 Enterprise GA becomes available on October 18.

   And with the [36]new business PCs recently announced at IFA earlier
   this month, we also recommend businesses start targeting Windows 8.1
   touch PCs for their hardware refresh planning, as well as evaluate
   Windows 8.1 for all device form factors.

   Additional Information About Windows 8.1 Enterprise RTM Availability

   To make sure that our Volume License customers running Windows 8 can
   experience the great benefits Windows 8.1 has to offer, organizations
   that acquired Windows 8 Pro through a VL agreement are licensed for
   Windows 8.1 Pro even if their SA expired prior to the GA release of
   Windows 8.1 Pro. This does not apply to Windows 8 Enterprise; you must
   have active SA for the Windows desktop operating system to have rights
   to Windows 8.1 Enterprise licenses. Windows 8.1 for production use (Pro
   and Enterprise) will be available through the VLSC on October 18 and
   for new customers to purchase through [37]Microsoft Volume License
   Resellers beginning November 1.

   We're excited about this next step as we approach Windows 8.1 GA next
   month. So please, download Windows 8.1 RTM via [38]TechNet or [39]MSDN
   today to start testing the operating system in your organizations.

   * Starting at 12:00am on October 18th in New Zealand (that's 4:00am on
   October 17th in Redmond).

       Hello,
       I signed in to my Volume License account but it doesn't appear to
       be available for download yet.  Any idea what time it will be
       available?
       Thank You,

       [48]Harry Caskey - Hi Harry, are you a VL customer with an active
       Software Assurance agreement? if so, you should be able to sign in
       to TechNet to download Windows 8.1 Enterprise RTM. If you don't
       have an active Software Assurance agreement, see the above blog
       post re: bits becoming available through the VLSC.

       [51]yuhong - that is my understanding, yes but I am double checking
       on that.

       Brandon, how can I tell which agreement I have?  I do have access
       to sign into VLSC.  I can download other products but I don't see
       Windows 8.1 yet.

       products but I still don't see Windows 8.1 listed. :(

       I'm in the same boat. I'm looking at my Volume Licensing site in
       the Software Assurance section and all I see is Windows 7 and
       Windows 8. No Windows 8.1.

       [61]Harry Caskey and [62]SandyWood -  The Windows 8.1 Enterprise
       bits will not be available in VLSC until Oct 18. In the meantime,
       if you have SA you should leverage your TechNet subscription to
       gain access to Windows 8.1 Enterprise through TechNet.
       To activate your TechNet subscription:
       1. Sign into VLSC
       2. Click the "Software Assurance" tab
       3. Click the "TechNet SA Subscription Service" link
       4. Follow instructions to activate your TechNet Subscription

       Brandon, I have activated my "TechNet SA Subscription Service"
       through my Volume License, but when I log in to TechNet it says
       that I don't have any subscription associated with the account. Are
       you certain that this should work? On the account page it shows my
       subscription benefits as Priority Support in TechNet Forums and
       TechNet Online Chat. Should I have more than that?

       Good news hopefully, although I have some questions:
       1) I am using win 8 ent + visual studio 2012 which was acquired as
       part of a now expired msdn open value agreement; from the above it
       seems that " organizations that acquired Windows 8 Pro through a VL
       agreement are licensed for Windows 8.1 Pro even if their SA expired
       prior to the GA release of Windows 8.1 Pro" applies and I am able
       to get  8.1 pro - is this so and will this be available also via
       the store?
       2) How do I benefit from 8.1 pro from 8 enterprise - can I convert
       this to 8.1 pro without  a reinstall?
       3) Additionally I bought a new pc with an oem win 8 std installed,
       which I upgraded to 8 pro using the msdn version, is this possible
       to upgrade for free to 8.1?
       thanks
       Andrew

       TechNet subscriptions that come from SA are 'Forum and Chat' only.
       No downloads!

       Thanks JorgTheElder. That's what I thought, but it seems like a
       number of the reports about the download being available aren't
       very clear. I'll try to stay patient until 10/18.

       ok, but paragraph two here:
       Beginning today, TechNet and MSDN subscribers will now have access
       to Windows 8.1 Enterprise RTM. This also includes access for Volume
       License (VL) customers with an active Software Assurance (SA)
       agreement, as you receive a TechNet subscription as part of SA.
       Leads me to believe its available....  oh well, It's not like I
       have nothing else to do.

       [75]Harry Caskey, [76]mkeehn, [77]JorgTheElder, and [78]JoeZeppy412
       - yes the bits are there and are available.
       My apologies for the confusion. The instructions included in my
       previous comment on this were incorrect. I was able to go get
       educated on how this should work for VL customers with Software
       Assurance.
       As part of SA, you get access to TechNet Chat and Newsgroups *as
       well as* a TechNet Plus Direct subscription. The TechNet Plus
       Direct subscription is where you will find the bits.
       Please note that only one person within your organization can be
       assigned access to your company's TechNet Plus Direct subscription
       (and has access to the downloads).
       If you are not that person who is assigned - you will not have
       access to the downloads.
       To determine who from your company the TechNet Plus Direct
       subscription is assigned to within an agreement (for subscriptions
       already activated):
       1. Sign into VLSC.
       2. Select Software Assurance from the top menu.
       3. Click on TechNet Plus Direct Subscription. This will take you to
       the Software Assurance Benefit Details Page.
       4. Click on the LicenseID for which you want to manage TechNet Plus
       Direct subscription. This will take you to another summary page.
       5. Click on TechNet Plus Direct Subscription under Activated
       Benefits.
       If you have not activated your TechNet Plus Direct subscription for
       your company as part of your Software Assurance agreement:
       1. Sign into VLSC.
       2. Select Software Assurance from the top menu.
       3. Click on TechNet Plus Direct Subscription. This will take you to
       the Software Assurance Benefit Details Page.
       4. Click on the LicenseID for which you want to manage TechNet Plus
       Direct subscription. This will take you to another summary page.
       5. Select TechNet Plus Direct Subscription.
       6. Enter contact information and applicable domains for your
       organization.
       7. Click Activate Benefit.
       To reiterate - these instructions are for VL customers with an
       active Software Assurance agreement.

       Thank you for clearing up the instructions. However when I click my
       license-id in step 4 in constantly recieves an "We are unable to
       complete your request at this time. Please close the browser and
       try again". How should I proceed?

       For those of us with SA, but who have not activated TechNet Direct
       Plus before the September 1st 2013 date, is there a way to activate
       TechNet Direct Plus any more?  All I get is an error, and we have
       had SA for well over 7 years, but never needed to use TechNet
       Direct Plus, so we never activated it.
       It would be better if we could just get this through VLSC, since
       TechNet subscripts were supposed to be retired anyway, and since no
       one seems to think it important to put Enterprise editions on MSDN,
       which we have an active account on.

       Hello,
       you talked about testing and preparing the organization for W8.1
       Enterprise.
       But are any Information about activation available? What to prepare
       about KMS?
       Current 8.1 Enterprise is not able to activate by a KMS which
       already in place for Windows 8 activation.
       Is an update necessary for the KMS Server?
       Will there a new key available for 8.1 activation?
       Please any official Information.
       thx
       Daniel
