   With the rise of web journalism, science writers are becoming less
   categorized by the media outlet they work for. More and more they are
   becoming multimedia "backpack" journalists, not only bringing their
   traditional notebooks to cover stories, but also audio recorders and
   still and video cameras, and computers with which to tweet and blog.

   For example, newspaper and magazine science journalists may write news
   and feature articles for their print publications and also produce blog
   posts, podcasts, interactive graphics and video for their websites.

   Conversely, radio and TV science journalists, besides writing scripts
   and turning them into audio and video segments, may also turn out text
   articles for the web site.

   Science writers may not even work for traditional outlets, but may be
   independent bloggers or bloggers affiliated with the web sites of
   magazines or other media. Much of a writer's time may be spent using
   social media tools to filter breaking science news and interact
   directly with audiences.

   Book authors produce the most in-depth science reporting, devoting
   often years of work and hundreds of thousands of words to explaining
   their topics. In addition to fulfilling the traditional work of an
   author, they may also be involved in producing audio, video and
   interactive content for ebooks and tablet apps.

   Similarly, the work of science PIOs extends beyond text news releases
   to video news releases, audio podcasts, blog posts and reports for
   social media outlets (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) explaining research at
   their institutions

   News releases are produced in a journalistic style but commonly offer
   only the perspective of the PIO's employer. Such releases are also
   frequently more detailed than a news article, since the releases must
   contain information meant for a wide range of science writers and other
   audiences. There are many types of news releases, including:
     * The hard news release, which reports on a discovery published in a
       scientific journal or discussed in a talk at a scientific
       conference
     * The feature release, which describes work in progress and is not
       generally tied to a newly published result
     * The backgrounder, a nuts-and-bolts history of a piece of research
     * The personal profile, which describes the scientist's professional
       and private worlds.
     * The Q&A, which offers a scientist's opinions and explanations in
       his/her own words
     * The media alert, which notifies journalists of a news conference or
       other event
     * The grant/gift announcement, which describes a new gift or grant,
       explaining the objectives of the new research
     * The award announcement, which announces an honor or prize given a
       scientist
     * The tipsheet, a collection of short items alerting journalists to
       work being presented at a conference or in a journal issue

   Besides news releases, science PIOs may also produce articles for
   institutional magazines, speeches and brochure copy.

   PIOs also oversee distribution of their releases and other content to
   the media and other audiences, handle media inquiries and organize and
   conduct news conferences. They may also assist scientists in providing
   background and opinion for journalists preparing stories on breaking
   news with a science angle.

   More broadly, they may manage communication strategies for
   controversial issues from animal rights, to scientific misconduct, to
   conflict of interest. They may also organize educational and background
   conferences and courses for science journalists and manage
   journalist-in-residence programs. And they may develop communication
   training programs for their scientists.
