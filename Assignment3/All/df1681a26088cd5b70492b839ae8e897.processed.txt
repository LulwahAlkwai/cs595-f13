Health journalists John Fauber and Joanne Silberner will share 2013 Victor
Cohn prize for medical science reporting

   Health journalists John Fauber, a medical investigative reporter for
   the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and Joanne Silberner, a freelance
   multimedia journalist and former National Public Radio correspondent,
   are the recipients of the 2013 Victor Cohn Prize for Excellence in
   Medical Science Reporting.

   Given the strong pool of entries, the judges elected to split the prize
   for the first time since the inaugural award in 2000. Silberner, now
   based in Seattle, was cited for her recent radio series on neglected
   diseases in developing countries, as well as her outstanding coverage
   of health policy at NPR. Fauber was cited for his relentless and
   exemplary investigative reporting on conflicts of interest in medicine
   and industry.

   The Victor Cohn prize, for a body of work published or broadcast within
   the last five years, is administered by the Council for the Advancement
   of Science Writing, Inc. (CASW), a not-for-profit organization of
   journalists and scientists committed to improving the quality of
   science news and information reaching the public.

   Joanne Silberner Fauber (near right) and Silberner (left) will share
   the $3,000 award and receive certificates at an awards ceremony in
   Gainesville, FL on Saturday, November 2, to be held during
   ScienceWriters2013, a joint meeting of CASW and the National
   Association of Science Writers (NASW).

Joanne Silberner

   The Cohn Prize judges lauded Silberner, whose reporting career spans
   more than three decades, for "consistently breaking new ground in a
   heavily covered beat, and recognizing new angles in important stories
   rather than offering stories that everyone else covers." Moreover, they
   said, "she then tells those stories with great humanity, with a keen
   understanding of public health policy implications and with verve."

   The judges were particularly impressed by Silberner's enterprising
   December 2012 seven-part series on global cancer issues in Haiti, India
   and Uganda: "Her sparkling storytelling and the human dimensions in
   this series are hallmarks of Silberner's sterling radio career," they
   said. The radio series, broadcast on Public Radio International's "The
   World," was an independent multimedia project initiated by Silberner
   with travel support from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

   Silberner's work, the judges added, is "notable for its diversity, and
   eye (and ear) for the telling detail. In the series on cancer, for
   example, she catches the listener with the fact that more people in
   poor and developing countries die of cancer than of HIV/AIDS,
   tuberculosis and malaria combined. She also brought a personal
   emotional connection by comparing a Ugandan breast cancer patient's
   experience with her own bout with the disease." She has also reported
   on other public health issues, including mental illness, tropical
   diseases, chronic fatigue syndrome, H1N1 influenza, the Affordable Care
   Act, the Haiti earthquake medical disaster, vaccines and immunology,
   and drug and food safety regulation at the US Food and Drug
   Administration.

   The prize committee unanimously and readily agreed with the assessment
   rendered by Wall Street Journal reporter Ron Winslow that her selection
   of topics "speak to her enterprise and to her determination to mine
   unexpected and neglected subjects and report to her readers and
   listeners well ahead of the pack." Also writing in support of her
   nomination, Joe Palca of NPR said: "Joanne has that rare combination of
   the ability to see the big picture and at the same time sweat the
   details."

   Silberner began her career in medical writing in 1982 for Science News,
   went on to write for U.S. News & World Report, and then moved into
   radio at NPR in Washington, DC, where she covered medical research and
   health policy for 18 years. She has also been a leader in science
   writing as a founding member of both the DC Science Writers Association
   and the Association of Health Care Journalists. In addition to
   freelance work, she is an artist-in-residence at the University of
   Washington, where she also teaches journalism.

   Silberner is a graduate of The Johns Hopkins University (BA in biology)
   and holds a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate
   School of Journalism. She also completed a yearlong fellowship at the
   Harvard School of Public Health.

   Her work has been widely honored by numerous organizations, earning
   awards from the Society of Professional Journalists, American Heart
   Association, New York State Mental Health Association, March of Dimes
   and Easter Seals. Silberner was also a member of NPR teams that won the
   Dupont Silver Baton and the Peabody and National Academies
   Communication awards.

John Fauber

   Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Fauber was cited for what the
   judges said was his "dogged, never-give-up" investigative series,
   dubbed "Side Effects," on financial conflicts of interest in medical
   research and health care delivery. His  stories also appear in MedPage
   Today, an online medical news web site, as part of a partnership
   between the two news organizations.

   The series, launched in 2009, looks at the pervasive marketing efforts
   of drug and medical device companies and how they affect patient care,
   doctor education, drug regulation and medical publishing. It offers
   rigorous scrutiny of drug companies' use of financially conflicted
   doctors and flawed or over-hyped science to win FDA approval for drugs
   and devices that then come to market overpriced and overprescribed, the
   judges noted.

   Fauber's series told, for example, of guidelines issued for asthma
   treatment that were put together by physicians with financial ties to
   the maker of Advair, despite readily available evidence that the
   medicine could pose dangers and is vastly overprescribed. In another
   story, he revealed eyebrow-raising links between drug makers and
   disease advocacy groups, which promoted or paid for clinical trials,
   fueled the rapid growth of drug sales and returned portions of the drug
   company's profits to the non-profit advocacy organization. Although
   Fauber made clear that some of the advocacy groups' activities greatly
   advance the development of treatments for "orphan diseases," his
   articles raise serious questions about conflicts of interest that may
   cloud clinical judgment and influence prescribing habits.

   In other stories, Fauber exposed how a money-making spinal device won
   FDA approval even though FDA's own advisory panel knew researchers with
   financial ties to the company got study results twice as good as those
   without such ties.

   The judges were especially impressed by Fauber's revelations that such
   conflicts are too rarely revealed to physicians or the public, and by
   his "willingness to pore over thousands of pages of documents,
   regulatory files and medical articles," many obtained by open-records
   requests, in pursuit of his stories.

   As the MIT Knight Science Journalism Tracker blog put it, "John Fauber
   apparently missed the memo on the death of print journalism and the
   dwindling opportunities for investigative reporting. He continues to go
   to work, chase documents, make calls and produce remarkable stories
   that any of us could have done, but didn't."

   Fauber began his 35-year newspaper career as a reporter at the
   Milwaukee Sentinel, before leaving for a three-year stint as an
   investigative columnist for the weekly Business Journal. In 1988, he
   became a business reporter at the Milwaukee Journal and, in 1995, moved
   into health, medical and science reporting at the Milwaukee Journal
   Sentinel (a consolidation of both Milwaukee papers that is the largest
   newspaper in Wisconsin).

   He covered heart disease, cancer and neurology until 2009, when his
   work focused on conflicts of interest in medicine. The "Side Effects"
   series already has won numerous awards, including the 2012 Loeb Prize
   for beat reporting, the 2010 National Headliner Award for
   medical/health/science writing, and the Barlett & Steele Silver Award
   for Investigative Business Journalism. He was a finalist for the
   Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism in 2003 for his work on
   chronic wasting disease. His other honors include the Howard L. Lewis
   Achievement Award presented by the American Heart Association, an
   earlier Loeb Prize, and three national journalism fellowships. Fauber
   has a bachelor's in journalism from the University of
   Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

The Victor Cohn Prize

   This year's entries were judged by Ben Patrusky, CASW's executive
   director emeritus; Joann Rodgers, a freelance writer and author, and
   faculty scholar at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics;
   CASW immediate past president Cristine Russell, a freelance writer and
   senior fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government; and Carl
   Zimmer, an independent science and medical journalist.

   This year marks the 14th presentation of the Victor Cohn Prize for
   Excellence in Medical Science Reporting.  The inaugural award in 2000
   was shared by Laurie Garrett of Newsday and Lawrence K. Altman of The
   New York Times.  Subsequent recipients were Jon Palfreman, a public
   television documentarian; Shannon Brownlee, a noted magazine writer and
   book author; Michelle Trudeau of NPR; Rick Weiss of the Washington
   Post; Jerome Groopman of The New Yorker; Geeta Anand of The Wall Street
   Journal; Joe Palca of NPR; Denise Grady of The New York Times; Marilynn
   Marchionne of the Associated Press; Ron Winslow, of The Wall Street
   Journal; and Jon Cohen of Science Magazine.

   The award honors the late Washington Post medical writer and health
   columnist Victor Cohn, who distinguished himself by the clarity and
   effectiveness of his reporting during a 50-year career. He was a
   co-founder in 1959 of CASW.
