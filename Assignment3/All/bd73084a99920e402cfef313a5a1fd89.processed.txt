The Microsoft Management Summit: Saying Goodbye to a Good Friend

   Posted 19 days ago in [67]Events, [68]Events, [69]MMS,
   [70]myITforum.com

   I've been reluctant to write this, primarily because it's hard to put
   into words what I feel about the end of the Microsoft Management Summit
   - at least properly. As many of you know, I was there at the very
   beginning of MMS as one of the founding members of the event. I put my
   heart and soul into each year, contributing through speaking, managing,
   vetting sessions, creating and running unique community events,
   building one of the most sought after party tickets, and putting a
   friendly face on an event that, sadly, turned into a marketing scene
   for Microsoft in the latter years.

   In the end, it was Microsoft's conference to do with as they pleased.
   Microsoft took over the event from Altiris in 2002, who acquired the
   conference from Computing Edge/Swynk in 1999. At its very beginnings,
   MMS was built by, and around, community. People don't seem to realize
   these days how important a concept that really is. Just as myITforum
   was put in place to fill a need, MMS was put together for the same
   reason. One thing we've learned over the years is that you can't just
   put up a web site or start an event from scratch and call it a
   community. Community takes work, and to just stick the "community" tag
   on something that was less for the community and more about
   individuals, just dilutes and taints the community message. No, the
   community comes first and then based on the needs and requirements, you
   can then build something monumental.

   Turning a community event into a marketing platform, in truth, is what
   ended MMS. In concept, MMS actually died a few years back - but, the
   folks at myITforum worked extremely hard to buy and barter to keep the
   community aspect of the event somewhat intact. We even fought extra
   hard over the last few years just to keep the event going. Many of you
   don't realize the effort that was. Those that attended MMS in the last
   few years, though they loved it and desired to always return, really
   never experienced the true MMS and I feel sorry for them. For alumni
   who attended in recent years, it was less about the conference itself,
   and more about catching up with peers. So, the community thrived amid
   the adversity - creating their own sub-conference to ensure their own
   value.

   In the beginning, MMS was a great event where we could highlight
   individuals in the community and give them a chance to advance their
   professional career through speaking, leading BOFs, and providing
   pre-con training sessions. A lot of the "big name" speakers at TechEd
   and MMS you see today, countless recognized experts in the community,
   and top Microsoft employees, got their start through the myITforum
   leadership of MMS. MMS hasn't been able to provide that for years, and
   I want to personally apologize for that.

   Throughout this year, after MMS 2013 ended, there were rumors that MMS
   would not continue. One reason was the lack of an announcement for the
   date and location for MMS 2014. I maintained that it would continue no
   matter what. And, while MMS 2014 will not take place, I can promise you
   that the true legacy of MMS will. Even up until a week or so ago, the
   promise of MMS 2014 was still on the table, but with so many "shock and
   awe" changes going on at Microsoft these days, there's truly nothing
   that is written in rock. I'm sure there are many more surprises coming,
   and some of them may have to do with other Microsoft conferences in the
   future.

   We've seen a lot of successes over the years, but also learned some
   hard lessons. The primary lesson goes back to the basics of allowing
   the community to build what they need. In a few short weeks, TechEd
   2014 registration will go live. TechEd is a wonderful conference of
   which I've been part of for the last 5 or 6 years, attempting to
   provide the same level of community building as with MMS. Many MMS
   alumni will be invited to attend TechEd. Microsoft will rework TechEd a
   bit to make the conference more favorable to those accustomed to the
   MMS experience. What that eventually looks like should
   prove...interesting. However, a retrofit is not exactly what is needed.

   One of the most exciting pieces of myITforum history happened in April
   this year that really brings this all together. In April, myITforum was
   acquired by Penton and became part of the Windows IT Pro network.
   Windows IT Pro itself has a popular and storied history, and has been
   part of hundreds of thousands of IT Pros lives for over a decade.
   Penton is outfitted with a highly experienced events crew, managing and
   running some of the largest events in the US in various industries. So,
   while myITforum brings content, community and events know-how, we get
   to take advantage of an expert team for running conference logistics. A
   match made in heaven.

   So, there's good news. Just as we gave the community what they needed
   in an event in the very beginning, we're working to do it again. In
   fact, a few of us have been preparing for this eventuality for a few
   years since a TechEd/MMS merge was first whispered. Over that time
   we've worked with sponsors who are 100% behind a new event, as long as
   it doesn't go down the same path as MMS did. So, you'll be glad to know
   that there truly is another event already available that takes great
   content, and great speakers, but puts community back as the
   cornerstone. We've been working hard the past several months to
   revitalize and re-envision [71]IT/Dev Connections. While we've already
   made great strides, several months is really not enough time, so we'll
   be working in phases. In two short weeks, phase 1 of our vision will
   kick-off and based on community feedback from the event, we'll be
   further evolving the conference for the next year, to ensure it meets
   all expectations and requirements for MMS alumni and at the same time,
   formally introduce a new audience to a true community conference.

   You'll notice that IT/Dev Connections is a Fall event. This is another
   lesson we learned a while back from community commentary about MMS. The
   March/April time frame for MMS was truly not the best value for IT Pros
   due to work-related projects, weather, and all sorts of variables.
   Plus, many companies need an event like this to help with budget and
   direction planning for the following year. Holding MMS in the Spring
   and early Summer months really provides no value for this. MMS was held
   at this time of the year for Microsoft's value, providing a venue for
   announcements, and in some respects for the last several years, a
   testing ground for TechEd.

   I know its short notice with only 2 weeks to go, but if you can arrange
   it, I highly suggest registering for IT/Dev Connections today. Register
   [72]HERE. If you're interested, I even have some special discount codes
   that can get you as much as $500 off the event. Email me directly for
   more information. And, if you can't attend this year, keep watching the
   IT/Dev Connections site and myITforum for the evolution of the event,
   and plan to attend in 2014.

   To be clear, IT/Dev Connections is not a replacement for MMS, but a
   reboot. It's exactly what is needed.

   So, while I'm horribly sad (literally to tears when I think about it)
   that MMS is no more, I'm also excited to bring back the best of our
   beginnings in an event that is shaped and molded by you. It's said that
   the best recourse when faced with adversity, is stand up and do
   something about it. So, we're wiping away the tears, standing up, and
   doing it.

   I can't wait for you all to see what we can build together.

   So...what did MMS mean to you? What were your favorite parts? What do
   you believe should have been improved about MMS?  Leave your notes in
   the comments.

       I admit, a lot of the reason I went to MMS every year was to catch
       up with old friends. We always joked that we made our own
       conference inside a conference because our group had gotten so
       large. Its going to be sad to see it go.
     * GarthMJ
       I'm truly sad to see MMS go. In the past I
       had team member go to TechED and they all said the same thing.
       TechED is a
       waste of time! Why you ask, the simple reason is, TechED is trying
       to be all things
       to everyone and not good at any of them.
       Conversely MMS (particularly in the early
       years) is deeply technical and you can talk to the speaker no only
       after the presentation
       but throughout the week. You can find Product team members, MVPs
       and other community
       members, each will all help you try to solve your problem. These
       contacts are invaluable
       as you can then touch base with them throughout the year. You might
       be able to
       do this at TechED but not the same degree, due to TechED size, you
       first have
       to track down someone in your area of expertise then hope that they
       know more
       than you. Good luck getting close to a presentor or evey try to
       figure out who
       the MVPs are in your area of expertise. In the end this is a lot of
       effort for
       little benefit.
       I look forward to attending IT/Dev Connection.
     * Dean Duensing
       Hey Rod, This is truly a sad time. I attended MMS in 1998, and have
       been back almost every year since. I have always walked away with
       new information, and a sense that the problems I struggle with are
       shared by many other people; I'm not alone! Thank you for the years
       of hard work! Congratulations on all the success, I hope the next
       thing is as valuable, and worthwhile. take care!
     * Scott Ewing
       Rod, congratulations on the sale of myITforum to Penton.
     * Doug Neal
       Glad to see your words, Rod. I fondly remember the Computing Edge
       owl figurines and T-shirts my first year at the event. The next
       year, there were Altiris denim shirts for presenters, which I was
       fortunate to wear as I presented on SMS 2.0 performance and
       scalability on behalf of Microsoft before they took ownership of
       the event in subsequent years. Thank you for all that you have done
       and continue to do to keep this vibrant, valuable community
       flourishing. -dugn

            Thanks, Doug! Always great to hear from you and so many fond
            memories!

       I really liked the focus on Configuration Manager at MMS. Being
       able to connect with people (BOF) and understand how other
       businesses in your industry are the System Center products (mainly
       configman) so that you can improve on your own. I wouldn't have the
       success in my career without the MyITForum community and it was
       clear that was the beginning of MMS. It is sad to see it go. I
       missed the last one!!!!!
     * Ed Aldrich
       As painful as it is to see the end of what used to be a terrific,
       community focused, event, I can now breathe a sigh of relief now
       that this is finally out in the bright light. Now we - the
       "community" - can begin to get back to what made this magic in the
       first place: a forum to share ideas, present tips & tricks on what
       works best, share how we solved thorny problems within our own
       environment, and share with everyone those personal Best Practices
       that makes this Systems Management discipline, and the System
       Center suite itself - such a great environment to work in. While it
       is always welcome and important to get direct Microsoft subject
       matter experts on stage, it is - in my opinion - equally or even
       more important to get those "Industry Expert" speakers on stage.
       These are the guys and gals who are working in the DEEP end of the
       trenches! I'm proud to have been one in the past on many occasions
       at past MMS events, and as a long time member of this myITForum
       community, I'm VERY excited about what comes next! While having the
       behind-the-scenes resources available from Penton, in the end the
       next conference itself - speakers and content - should be community
       driven. After all, who knows what we want and need better than
       ourselves?
     * Bob Kelly
       Wow. Sad indeed, but I think few will disagree a reboot has
       become necessary. I hadn't even realized MMS had changed from a
       conference
       about managing Windows systems to an event about promoting System
       Center until
       I was nearly asked to leave for breaking such rules. Those running
       the event
       threatened to have our AppDeploy.com booth taken down because it
       did not
       "specifically offer integration with System Center". They reported
       to have
       already had Novel take down the Zenworks corner of their booth. I
       managed to
       talk my way out of having to leave, but sure enough none of the
       vendors I had
       always liked visiting were to be found after years of
       participation. It's a
       shame that Microsoft would suddenly feel so threatened as to
       redirect the event
       in this way.
       The smaller, Computing Edge event I first attended was so much
       better focused on what mattered, it seemed to get better when first
       taken over
       by Microsoft, but then started loosing its roots more and more each
       year until
       ultimately we see it is no more. So it is sad, but I have to say I
       am excited
       about what may be born of its ashes. Rod + NT Magazine? That's a
       team I think
       people can (and will) get behind. Like many others I'm sure, I hope
       there is
       some way I can personally help.
          + http://www.myITforum.com/ Rod Trent
            Thanks, Bob! I'm really excited to get this moving and will
            totally be reaching out to you. I feel like we're getting back
            to where we need to be.
     * Ross Norrie
       I will fondly remember MMS. It was there on April 26 2006, the we
       announced the sale of my company, AssetMetrix to Microsoft. Many
       did not know that minutes before the announcement we were in the
       satellite FedEx office actually signing the papers :-)
       What followed was a whirlwind of a few days and an interesting few
       years !!
       Cheers,
       Ross

       I attended all but the 2013 MMS both as a techie then as a
       Microsoft employee and back to techie and have seen many changes
       from desktop focus to more holistic management to product
       focus(SystemCenter) to venue changes (Orlando, Vegas, San Diego,
       Vegas and even multiple locations in Vegas (MGM, Venetian, Mandolay
       etc) but the one thing I always looked forward to was `The
       Gathering' the recognition of so many of the faces of the faithful
       and careers that had been built on management. The world will not
       feel the same anymore.
     * Christopher Balk
       There was so much to like about this event. I remember the first
       Computing Edge conference, and only having a couple rooms for
       breakouts, then in a few years we had tripled the attendance. I
       still have the PowerPoints from those events. Then in recent years
       watching Bill and Brady give their State of the Union and top 10
       lists. Networking and Community, always great; but I also
       appreciated having some dedicated time to learn some of the tech
       that I didn't have at home or at work. Always a "SMS guy", I liked
       being able to run a few other labs. TechEd never had that bent to
       it.
       Of course, there ain't no party like a myITForum party :) I look
       forward to the next gen.
       Rod - thanks for this great write up, it made me tear up a bit, but
       I know the future is in good hands. (and congrats on the Penton
       deal, what a trip you've had since SWYNK).
          + http://www.myITforum.com/ Rod Trent
            I know. How can you truly cover over 14 years of good memories
            in single post? It was a great ride.
     * Chad Simmons
       I was only able to attend MMS twice over the years. In 2009, my
       rookie
       year, I focused heavily on filling every timeslot with a session.
       That was easy to do and I got a huge amount of training out of the
       event. But after it was over I realized that I had missed out on
       something big. I had attended more than 5 sessions sitting next to
       Sherry Kissinger, Brian Mason, and the Wells Fargo team... some of
       the best in the business, and yet didn't connect with them. It
       became a running joke on my team that I knew the MOF Master, but
       not really.
       I was again allowed to attend in 2013 and took a totally different
       approach. My primary goal was to network, find people that knew
       more than I did, and pick their brains or even just hang out and
       listen. I kept a hectic schedule attending sessions/gatherings from
       7:30am until 10pm or so every night skipping meals and avoiding
       "Vegas". I was able to do a few non-conference activities too
       including running a 5K and attending the Bible study. Those are my
       best memories along with having lunch with Rod and helping out
       Mikko. In the end I skipped out on a number of sessions, but for
       the most part that's OK... I've downloaded the recordings. What I
       did get is to hang out with some of the best people in the
       industry. MMS is still giving back to me and I'm grateful.
       I won't get to attend IT/Dev Connections this year, but it's been
       on my radar for quite some time. Hopefully my boss will let me go
       in 2014 and experience a true community event.
       Also, System Center Universe 2014 in January isn't far from me.
       Perhaps I'll see some of you there.

            Hi, Chad! I'll be at SCU 2014. Hope to see you there!

       I will miss MMS. There is no other way to put it. Having attended
       for many years I fondly remember my first MMS years ago. After the
       third day I felt like there wasn't any more room left in my brain.
       I couldn't believe so much information could be covered in such a
       short period of time. I stayed late on Friday and found myself in
       one of the last conferences of the event. Everyone remaining was
       worn out, as they talked about SMS client repair tools that the
       community had been working on. That one session helped my career
       more than any other that first year. It made me realize how
       connected everyone was with one another, and willing to help each
       other.
       In subsequent years I found myself looking forward to the BOF
       sessions more than any others. The BOF sessions would sometimes go
       late into the evening with groups of people talking through real
       problems together. I have not been to any other conference,
       Microsoft or other, where people were willing to spend so much time
       together talking about the topic of the conference. It wasn't
       exclusively about the product. It was the understanding that we
       were all in this together, indifferent to the company where we
       might be working at the time. I think that is what made MMS so
       special to me. It was a place where I could spend a week with 100's
       of people who I could relate to, who had similar challenges, and
       understood the complexity, difficulty, and stress of systems
       management.
       Rod, thank you! You have become a role model through your
       contributions and leadership, with both MMS and MyITForum. I wasn't
       able to attend IT Connections this year, but it certainly sounds
       more like the earlier MMS's that I attended. It will definitely be
       on my radar for next year.
       Thanks again for all that you have done for our community.

            George -- you're gonna love IT/Dev Connections. It has the
            same feel as the early MMS's. It actually made me tear-up
            reflecting on it. This event truly can get us back to where
            events belong.
