France Córdova, Former President of Purdue U., Is Named to Lead NSF

   By Paul Basken

   Washington

   President Obama announced on Wednesday his nomination of France A.
   Córdova, a former president of Purdue University, to serve as the new
   director of the National Science Foundation.

   Ms. Córdova, an astrophysicist, is now chair of the Smithsonian
   Regents, the governing board of the Smithsonian Institution. She was
   appointed to that post in January, six months after ending a five-year
   term as Purdue's president as she neared the mandatory retirement age
   of 65. Ms. Córdova turns 66 on Monday.

   If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Córdova would replace Cora B. Marrett,
   an NSF career official who has been serving as the agency's acting
   director since March, when [17]Subra Suresh left to become president of
   Carnegie Mellon University.

   The NSF, which has an annual budget of about $7-billion, finances about
   20 percent of all federally supported basic research at American
   universities.

   Ms. Córdova's nomination extends a series of top-level connections
   between the NSF and Purdue, which has been regularly ranked in the top
   50 universities nationwide in total federal spending on research and
   development.

   Arden L. Bement Jr. was a professor of nuclear engineering at Purdue
   before becoming the science agency's director, in 2004. He stepped down
   in 2010 to return to the university and lead its new Global Policy
   Research Institute. And Steven C. Beering, who led the NSF's governing
   board from 2006 to 2010, served as Purdue's president from 1983 to
   2000.

   Ms. Córdova currently serves on the National Science Board. A member
   since 2008, she leads its Committee on Strategy and Budget. One of 12
   children of a Mexican father and an Irish-American mother, she was
   raised in California and completed a bachelor's degree in English at
   Stanford University before earning a doctorate in physics from the
   California Institute of Technology.
