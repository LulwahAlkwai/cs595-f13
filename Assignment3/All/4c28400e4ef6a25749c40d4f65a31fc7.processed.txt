How to copy keys with your smartphone

   front of a key back of a key

Hold the key in your hand, by its loop

   Take photos of both sides. Be a sport, don't conceal the "Do not
   duplicate" mark if there is one. And as a security measure, please let
   us see your fingers.
   the key is too far the key is too blurry

Photograph both sides from 4 inches away

   Capture the entire key. Focus the camera on the blade of the key. On
   most phones, you can choose where to focus the camera by tapping on the
   screen.
   email the photos send photo at the highest resolution possible

Email pictures to [6]keys@keysduplicated.com

   Send the highest resolution photos possible.

   Hint: On your phone, click the link above and attach photos to the
   email.

That's it! Our robot will analyze your picture and send you an email asking
for a shipping address in the United States and your payment information.

              More tips for taking great pictures of your keys?

   key blanks we currently support

   For now, we accept two types of keys. Your house key is probably one of
   these.
   tap on the screen to focus the camera

   Focus the camera on the blade of the key. On most phones, you can
   choose where to focus by tapping on the screen.
   use a plain background

   It's easier to analyze a key when the background isn't textured. A
   sheet of paper would make a much cleaner background.
   hold the key in your hands

   As a security measure, hold the key in your hand when you photograph
   it.

   We're based in San Francisco, CA. Check out our [7]facebook page, or
   drop us a note at [8]support@keysduplicated.com. For technical details,
   visit our [9]blog. Here's the team:

Ali Rahimi [10][linkedin-icon-small.jpg] [11][facebook.gif]

   Ali programmed the robots that analyze and cut your keys. He has a PhD
   from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. He builds
   machine learning and computer vision systems.

Pascal Wassam

   Pascal built the robots. He's a mechanical engineer and an electronics
   wizard. The robots lived in his kitchen before we moved to our
   headquarters.

Sam Napier

   Sam is a veteran licensed locksmith. He's been locksmithing in San
   Francisco for 30 years and is well-known in these parts. He's so good
   he could probably cut your keys with his teeth if he had to.

Burt

   Burt was Pascal's first key robot. Burt is fast, heavy, loud, expensive
   and supremely accurate. Burt is mostly retired, but we still ask him to
   cut some of the tougher keys.
   [maximilian.jpg]

Maximilians 1 through 15

   One of the Maximilians will most likely cut your key. They're Pascal's
   third generation robots. They're fast, accurate, and reliable. These
   little guys zip around pieces of metal to sculpt a gang of keys in an
   eye blink.

     Joe Heitzeberg. Seattle, WA

     I've had hardware stores copy my key twice but never got a good cut.
     Yours worked smoothly and perfectly. It's worth the five bucks just
     to see your computer vision at work.
     David Gould, Illinois

     The key worked! Can your system replicate the human soul too?
     Zack Lipton. Oakland, CA

     The key you mailed me works better than several I've had duplicated
     by traditional methods.
     Ben Greenstein. Seattle, WA

   We take lots of precautions to ensure the security of your key. Meet
   [17]the folks who cut your keys.

Worried about surreptitious duplication?

   It's always dangerous to leave your keys unattended. Someone could
   [18]imprint them on clay or measure them with a [19]key gauge then copy
   them at a hardware store. A person with nefarious intent is more likely
   to choose these methods over Keys Duplicated because:

   A credit card is required to ship the key, so in case of fraud,
   identity can be traced back. We'll cooperate with law enforcement
   inquiries in case of fraud (nothing like that has ever come up).

   We don't accept flyby pictures of keys. The key must be held in the
   person's hand, with their fingers visible.

Your information is kept safe and then quickly purged

   Your key and its associated information are stored on our server with
   bank-grade cryptography. Your shipping information is redacted from our
   system a few days after we ship your key. That way, no one (including
   us) can associate your key with your address.

The US postal service is the safest way to send keys

   Your mail slot is a safe place to receive your key when you're the only
   one who can access it. If you're worried about other people accessing
   your mail box, have us mail you at your workplace. Or maybe you're
   duplicating keys for a friend who's visiting. Then just have us send
   the key to them directly.

   We provide bulk discounts, periodic invoices, and a key management
   console for customers who maintain and copy a lot of keys.

For delivery, pickup, and cleaning services

   Give your customers the option to email you their keys from your
   website. Set up "key upload" widget on your checkout page, or send us
   the photos they email you and weâll send you the physical keys. You may
   have seen other businesses provide this service. Chances are they're
   powered bu us.

   mastering keys for property managers

Key management for property managers

   Do you keep hundreds or thousands of keys on file and copy them
   regularly? Manage your online keys through our console, and order
   copies as needed.

Key Exchange for frequent AirBNB hosts

   Send your guests the keys to your AirBNB rental by mail ahead of time.
   This gives them a fallback if their flight is delayed or you can't meet
   them to hand off the key.
