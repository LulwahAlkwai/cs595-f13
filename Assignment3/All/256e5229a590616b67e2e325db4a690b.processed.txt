   iOS 7 Blows. iOS 7 reviews are coming in and some aren't exactly
   glowing. You may want to wait to upgrade.
   What is fascinating is the mistake that Apple made fun of Microsoft
   for, cryptic uninformative error messages, they appear to have
   repeated. While I expected this change to upset folks, we really don't
   like change, the initial ZDNet review suggests you may not want to
   install the new OS on older hardware because some cool things won't
   work and performance, particularly on iPads, will suck. Recall that
   Steve Jobs tested this stuff personally when he ran the company and
   this feels more like a product from a normal tech firm, not fully
   thought out initially and somewhat painful to use. You may want to read
   this before you upgrade. (Chances are Apple will fix some of the more
   annoying parts in a month or so). Full review on ZDNet today:
