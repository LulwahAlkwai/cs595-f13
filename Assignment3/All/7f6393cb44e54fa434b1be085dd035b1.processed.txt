   Running Lean Book
   4.8 out of 5 stars on Amazon.com

   We are building more products than ever before, but most of them fail
   -- not because we fail to build what we set out to build, but because
   we waste time, money, and effort building the wrong product.

   What we need is a systematic process for quickly vetting product ideas
   and raising our odds of success.

   That is the promise of Running Lean.

   "Easily one of the best technical books on Lean Startup ever written."
   -- Dan Martell, Founder of Clarity.fm & Angel Investor

Praise for Running Lean

   "In Running Lean, Ash has put together a book I wish I'd read before
   pursuing my own startup. The lean methodology has received a lot of
   press, but the level of detail, including case studies and practical
   applications make this book a resource worthy of sitting on every
   aspiring entrepreneur's shelf. It's not just great advice, but a great
   read, too."

   Rand Fishkin, CEO and Co-Founder, SEOmoz, coauthor of The Art of SEO

   "Lean concepts are exciting but it's hard to know what to actually do.
   Ash not only gives advice but makes it practicable--this is the first
   comprehensive guidebook for how to execute a Lean Startup."

   Jason Cohen, founder of WP Engine & Smart Bear.

   "Ash provides compelling, actionable guidance for applying lean
   principles to a startup. His startup canvas changed the way I think
   about my own startup. This book is a valuable guide whether you are a
   serial entrepreneur or a first time founder."

   Sean Ellis, Founder & CEO of CatchFree

   "Customer validation has always been one of the best ways to eliminate
   wasted effort and shortcut directly to what will work. Eric Ries and
   Steve Blank did the startup world a great service by codifying and
   labeling the principles involved. Ash Maurya goes one further,
   providing a clear roadmap for Internet entrepreneurs, with a
   delightfully clear and simple writing style."

   David Skok, Author of for Entrepreneurs Blog, and General Partner at
   Matrix Partners

   "Ash has laid out a clear compass for anyone to validate their ideas,
   solve real problems and create a successful business. I'd encourage
   this book to anyone trying to get a business off the ground."

   Noah Kagan, Chief Sumo of AppSumo.com

   "If you are starting a company, Running Lean is a must read."

   Brad Feld, Managing Director of Foundry Group

About the Author -- Ash Maurya

   Ash-maurya

   [6]Ash Maurya is praised for offering some of the best and most
   practical advice out there for entrepreneurs. He challenges the notion
   that start-ups should plan based on gut, intuition and luck. Instead he
   applies a systematic process for rigorously stress testing your "Plan
   A" until you achieve a plan that works.

   Ash is the founder of [7]Spark59. He has launched several startups,
   including successful ventures such as WiredReach. Through his Running
   Lean workshops, he's worked closely with entrepreneurs to help them
   test and refine their vision. Ash holds mentor roles with startup
   accelerators around the world such as TechStars, Mozilla Foundation,
   Year One Labs, MaRS, and Capital Factory.
