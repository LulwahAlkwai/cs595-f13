   Screw the Electric Car, for $40K you can buy an electric plane.
   Granted you have about a 100 mile range so you aren't flying to Hawaii
   unless you have one hell of a tailwind or hook on the rear of Hawaiian
   bound commercial plane (which I wouldn't recommend). This new little
   electric ultralight, showcased in Green Car Reports this week, looks
   like a ton of fun. But realize that at least one of the flying car
   concepts is not talking about using electric motors for VTOL and
   electric on planes is starting to look rather interesting. (This will
   initially be a kit plane in the US). Article in Green Car Reports
   today:
