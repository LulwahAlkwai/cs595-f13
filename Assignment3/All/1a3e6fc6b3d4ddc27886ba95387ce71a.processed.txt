   One of the most overlooked aspects of academic science by graduate
   students and postdocs is the actual cost of conducting science in an
   academic lab. Before we take a look at what an average molecular
   biology lab costs to run, it is first best to frame the discussion in
   terms of running a small business. Academic labs produce a product ...
   research published in the primary literature. This product produces
   revenue ... grant money from various government and private agencies.
   To produce the product, academic labs must hire people (graduate
   students, postdocs, or technicians), they must purchase supplies and
   services, and they must pay their rent and utilities (which is usually
   done through indirects from an awarded grant).

   If we take an average-sized molecular biology lab with 1 technician, 6
   graduate students, and 2 postdocs, we can begin to understand the
   general costs associated with the science.

   A typical technician will cost $40-65,000 per year in salary and
   benefits depending upon experience. Each graduate student will cost
   about $40-50,000 per year including stipend, benefits, and tuition.
   Each postdoc will cost roughly $50-65,000 per year in salary and
   benefits depending upon years of experience. The principal investigator
   must also cover a portion of their salary, and this can range from
   $30-200,000 based on years of experience and amount required by their
   particular department. In our scenario using the lowest estimates,
   salaries and benefits overall will cost the average-sized molecular
   biology lab $410,000.

   Supplies, services, and reagents can add an additional $75-200,000
   based on whether animal costs are incurred. Thus, an average-sized
   molecular biology lab with 9 researchers will require at least $500,000
   per year in grant funds to support their research efforts.

   That is two modular R01s from NIH at $250,000 per year, three NSF
   grants at $150,000 per year, one R01 plus considerable training grant
   support, one R01 plus training grant support and some private funding.
   However the money comes, it is a considerable amount.

   To acquire $500,000 per year in funding means that the lab has to be
   fairly productive. And it should be, as most of that money is taxpayer
   dollars or funds from donors and we have a great responsibility to use
   that money wisely. A student who spends on average 5 years in graduate
   school will minimally cost $250,000 to train. A postdoc who spends 5
   years in the position minimally cost $300,000.

   What degree of productivity in terms of papers would you expect from
   those numbers if you were a taxpayer or donor? As a graduate student or
   postdoc, do you think about how much science you are productively
   conducting in relation to the cost of your training? Do you discuss the
   business aspect of science with your PIs?

   Talking money is always a touchy subject, but the reality is that
   science is an expensive enterprise and being savvy about how much it
   costs to run a lab will make you much more aware of the efforts
   required to keep a lab funded and productive.

   I do have to agree with the previous comment. I stay in my lab until
   wee hours at night, but it takes up eons to produce something vital in
   the scientific community. Sometimes, it looks as if we're not doing our
   best to have breakthroughs but we are!

   To answer your question, I have thought about how much science my lab
   has conducted in relation to our cost. Sometimes I feel like we're not
   doing enough, yet everyone is constantly working hard!
