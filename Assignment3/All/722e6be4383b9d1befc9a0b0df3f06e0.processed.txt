Quantum Tecniques/Gen Functions- don't be afraid of new techniques

   Ronald de Wolf gave a GREAT talk at CCC on the uses of Quantum
   techniques to Classical Problems. He made the analogy of using the Prob
   Method to prove non-prob results. This reminded me of the following
   false counterarguments I've heard about new techniques:
    1. The Prob Method: Isn't that just counting?
    2. Kolg complexity: Isn't that just the Prob Method?
    3. Information complexity: Isn't that just Kolg complexity?
    4. Counting: Isn't that just Information Complexity?

   In all of the cases above the complaint is idiotic--- while one COULD
   translate some (all?) proofs using Prob Method to Counting, it is
   easier to think in terms of Prob. The translation would be harder than
   just getting used to thinking probabilistically. By coincidence I spend
   some of my time at CCC looking for simple examples of generating
   functions where it would be difficult to do it any other way. I found
   one and liked it so much that I did a write up FOR YOU MY READERS! I
   suspect that it COULD be done using just algebra (or something) but you
   wouldn't want to. Here is the theorem and a link to my write up:

     (Schur's Theorem) Let a[1],a[2],...,a[L] be denominations of coins
     such that no number >= 2 divides all of them. Then, for large n, the
     number of ways to make change of n cents is

     n^L-1/((L-1)! a[1] a[2] ... a[L]) + O(n^L-2)

   For full proof see [5]here. My writeup is based on that in Wilf's book
   [6]generatingfunctionology (the title page really does use a small g
   for the first letter).
   The above was my INTENDED POST. However, when I showed the Gen-function
   proof of Schur's theorem to some students, one of them, Sam (a HS
   student), came back the next day with a purely combinatorial proof. It
   was not completely rigorous but I am sure that he and most of my
   readers, could make it so without too much effort. While having two
   proofs (Gen-function and Combinatorial) is MORE enlightening for me and
   for my readers, it does dampen my point that this is a theorem for
   which the gen-function proof is easier. I COULD argue that the
   gen-function proof did not require as much cleverness, or that once you
   put in the rigor it is harder, but I don't really have confidence in
   those arguments. I include the combinatorial proof in the writeup
   pointed to above. Which proof is better? A matter of taste. However, I
   hope you enjoy both of them!

       I think this is the usual conflict between relatively mechanical
       proofs that are easier to derive (generating functions) and "magic"
       proofs that are easier to understand (combinatorial). The former
       are better for authors; the latter are better for readers.
       And readers are more important than authors.

       @Jeff Erickson: even though a proof can be argued to be better when
       the reader's job is easier, I also have the feeling that "magic"
       proofs should not be always preferred -- including and having them
       is nice, but for the sake of research, a "mechanical" one is often
       very useful to the reader as well -- it'll give him tools and ideas
       about how to derive other results.
       While a ad hoc, very clever and seemingly magic proof is beautiful,
       very nice, but too often leaves the reader with the impression that
       not only taking the same approach for another problem is
       impossible, but even that you need to be a god-like genius to even
       prove anything.

       Clement: Agreed. I feel "reader" should be changed to "reviewer" in
       Jeff's comment :)

       Here is maybe a counterexample. For some time, it has been possible
       to perform "non-standard" real analysis using genuine
       infinitesimals. This is certainly more intuitive than standard
       analysis. But, for the most part, people have been content to work
       with standard analysis and translate all their infinitesimal
       intuition into the "standard way." Dealing with the new apparatus
       is just too cumbersome.

       I've frequently complained to Bill that most proofs that used
       Kolmogorov complexity could be rephrased as probabilistic
       arguments.
       Does it make a difference? To me it does, because I find
       probabilistic arguments easier to understand and more intuitive.
       But that is subjective, I guess. Slightly more objective arguments:
       (1) I find that the probabilistic argument tends to be shorter than
       the Kolm. proof. (In particular, proofs using Kolm. complexity
       sometimes have to set up a lot of notation/definitions first.)
       (2) I think one can assume the reader has the needed probability
       background, but not necessarily the Kolm. background.
       (3) Often, I find that it's not just one technique vs. another, but
       it ends up being *the same proof*, just that phrasing it in terms
       of Kolm. complexity obscures (at least to me) what is really going
       on. I wonder if sometimes people using Kolm. complexity aren't
       doing it to make their proof look more difficult than it really is.
       I don't claim the above hold always, but I do claim they hold most
       of the time Kolm. complexity is used.

       I've frequently complained to Bill that most proofs that used
       Kolmogorov complexity could be rephrased as probabilistic
       arguments.
       ...and most proofs using integral calculus can be rephrased using
       manual limits of Riemann summations. Down with calculus!
       I wonder if sometimes people using Kolm. complexity aren't doing it
       to make their proof look more difficult than it really is.
       My experience with K.C. is the complete opposite. Often a
       convoluted counting/probabilistic argument that makes the result
       look impressive devolves into a one liner: "the trace of the
       computation can be used to reconstruct the input and hence on a
       Kolmogorov random input the time taken is Omega(n)". No setup, no
       notation, no definitions.
       If the techniques above were merely restatements of each other no
       new problems would have been solved by them. Yet we do know that
       the exact opposite is the case. The new shorthands introduced by
       each of the methods listed by Bill above allowed us to solve
       important open problems.

       I wonder what you think about Euler's recurrence for the partition
       numbers p(n) (= number of ways to write n as the sum of
       nonincreasing positive integers). There is a purely algebraic
       generating function proof, there is a very beautiful bijective
       proof by Franklin of a key lemma, the Pentagonal theorem, which
       gives the recurrence via a very simple generating function
       manipulation, and then there is an explicit bijection using
       partition rank and Dyson maps. I think the mix of Franklin's
       bijection and the little bit of generating functions is the best
       proof: the entirely bijective proof maybe gives the best insight
       but is a bit complicated, while Franklin's bijection gives a very
       clear idea why the Pentagonal theorem is true. Here is a nice
       survey of results about integer partitions:

            My first thought: I looked at the survey- alas, so many papers
            to read, so little time.
            My second thought: You raise the intersting question of
            `what is the criteria for the best proof', which my post also
            did.
            Uses the most elementary techniques?
            Most insightful?
            Shortest (not my criteria but others use it)?
            Does not require cleverness?
            Is constructive (informally)?
            While insightful seems like the obvious answer it may not be
            if the proof is rather long before you get the insight.

       The problem with Sam's proof is that it doesn't use the necessary
       condition involving the greatest common divisor, nor even indicate
       why it comes up. It can, however, easily be extended to rigorously
       show that the *average* number of solutions for nearby n is as
       stated in the theorem.
       I graded a course last fall where this problem was assigned. The
       students came up with many inventive proofs, including the
       "intended" generating function proof. My favorite used the
       observation that the number of ways of making change for n and for
       n+a is "of the same order" if a is one of the coin denominations.
       (The cleanest proof seems to be by induction on the number of
       denominations so that you can justify claims about orders of
       growth.) By using Bezout's identity, it follows that the number of
       ways of making change for n and n+1 is "of the same order". (This
       solves the main deficiency in Sam's proof.)
       The proof may be finished in any number of ways, now that we know
       the number of solutions doesn't depend on any "local" properties of
       n. For example, we may compute the total number of ways of making
       change for all m up to n, whether combinatorially or as the volume
       of a certain simplex in L-dimensional space. Differentiating this
       function, whether literally or using a combinatorial averaging
       argument, finishes the proof.
