Why Professors at San Jose State Won't Use a Harvard Professor's MOOC

   Justin Ide, Harvard News Office

   Michael Sandel, shown giving a lecture at Harvard, says he hopes
   universities that use the MOOC version of his course do not force
   professors to use any more material from it than they wish to.

   By Steve Kolowich

   Professors in the philosophy department at San Jose State University
   are refusing to teach a philosophy course developed by edX, saying they
   do not want to enable what they see as a push to "replace professors,
   dismantle departments, and provide a diminished education for students
   in public universities."

   The San Jose State professors also called out Michael Sandel, the
   Harvard government professor who developed the course for edX,
   suggesting that professors who develop MOOCs are complicit in how
   public universities might use them.

   In an [17]open letter this week addressed to Mr. Sandel, the philosophy
   professors decried a dean's request that the department integrate a
   MOOC version of "Justice," the Harvard professor's famous survey
   course, into the curriculum at San Jose State.

   "In spite of our admiration for your ability to lecture in such an
   engaging way to such a large audience," the letter's authors write, "we
   believe that having a scholar teach and engage with his or her own
   students is far superior to having those students watch a video of
   another scholar engaging his or her students."

   The letter is part of a brewing debate about how MOOCs might deepen the
   divide between wealthy universities, which produce MOOCs, and less
   wealthy ones, which buy licenses to use those MOOCs from providers like
   edX.

   The authors say they fear "that two classes of universities will be
   created: one, well-funded colleges and universities in which privileged
   students get their own real professor; the other, financially stressed
   private and public universities in which students watch a bunch of
   videotaped lectures and interact, if indeed any interaction is
   available on their home campuses, with a professor that this model of
   education has turned into a glorified teaching assistant."

San Jose State's Experiment

   Under [18]Mohammad H. Qayoumi, the university's president, San Jose
   State has cast itself as a proving ground for the licensing model. In a
   pilot program, supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one
   section of an introductory course in electrical engineering last fall
   drew heavily on recorded lectures and other materials from "Circuits &
   Electronics," a MOOC from edX.

   Students in that section passed at a much higher rate than those in the
   traditional sections. In April, Mr. Qayoumi doubled down on the
   experiment, announcing that San Jose State would road-test [19]more edX
   courses on its campus, including courses in the humanities. The
   California State University system said it would push for similar
   experimentation with edX materials on 11 other campuses.

   Like [20]other faculty groups that have [21]resisted outside providers
   of online courses in recent weeks, the San Jose State philosophy
   professors said they are not opposed to online and "blended" courses.
   But the professors fear that maintaining high quality might not be a
   top priority as university and system administrators navigate the
   current budget crisis.

   In a statement to The Chronicle, San Jose State said it intends to
   leave faculty members in control of their courses, even where it is
   encouraging experimentation with edX materials like Mr. Sandel's
   course.

   "In the interest of clarity, our collaboration with edX does indeed
   locate the responsibility for the course solely with our faculty
   members, who will determine how much, or how little, of the edX course
   materials they will incorporate into their blended courses," wrote
   Ellen Junn, provost and vice president for academic affairs.

   "The administration would never impose or mandate these teaching
   methods on faculty members," Ms. Junn continued.

   But the authors of the philosophy-department letter are nonetheless
   worried about what could happen in the future. "Let's not kid
   ourselves; administrators at the CSU are beginning a process of
   replacing faculty with cheap online education."

   Peter J. Hadreas, chair of the philosophy department, said he believes
   that appealing to Mr. Sandel directly is the best way to spark a public
   conversation about the possible unintended consequences of superstar
   professors' working with edX and other MOOC providers.

   "I think he will answer it in good faith," said Mr. Hadreas. "I don't
   know if it will change his mind, but I would be interested to hear his
   response, and it might bring about some reconsideration."

   In a statement to The Chronicle, Mr. Sandel said he knows little about
   the arrangement between edX and San Jose State, but he hopes the
   university does not force professors there to use any more material
   from his MOOC than they wish to use.

   "The worry that the widespread use of online courses will damage
   departments in public universities facing budgetary pressures is a
   legitimate concern that deserves serious debate, at edX and throughout
   higher education," wrote Mr. Sandel. "The last thing I want is for my
   online lectures to be used to undermine faculty colleagues at other
   institutions." He declined to comment further.
