   Summary:

   An investigation this week revealed that major brands are paying at
   least $6 million a month to serve ads to bots on 202 websites. Here are
   some more names and details.

   A larger picture is emerging about an online advertising scam that is
   reportedly soaking major brands like McDonald's and Disney for [34]$6
   million a month. The scam, which has rattled publishers and the ad
   industry, came to light on Tuesday after a London analytics firm
   revealed that a network of zombie computers tricked the brands into
   paying to show their ads to robots.

   It has also resulted in "toothbrushing.net," a little-known site with
   oral hygiene news, likely racking up more visitors than famous
   publishers like The Economist.

   Here are some more details, based on sources close to the investigation
   and other reports, about who is affected  and the scale of the botnet.

Millions of "readers" for a toothbrush news site

   The "about" section of [35]Toothbrushing.net says the site is dedicated
   to "toothbrush enthusiasts" and promises the "latest on dental news."
   According to a source, the site is displaying 20 million to 25 million
   ad impressions a month. Since the site shows four ad slots on every
   webpage, this loosely translates to at least 5 million visitors. Nearly
   all of these visitors were bots not people but, for marketers, the
   effect is the same -- they pay either way. (The ad slots were empty
   when I checked today  - see the screenshot [36]Toothbrush site at
   right).

   To put the traffic of the toothbrush news site in perspective, consider
   that a site like the Economist had 1.7 million unique visitors in
   December and the New Yorker had 3.1 million. These figures refer to
   unique visitors so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison but, using
   this crude calculation, there's a good chance Toothbrushing.net did
   better than both of them.

   And it's not just the toothbrush site. Other obscure sites touched by
   bot networks, including Sodabottle.com and Techrockstar.com, likewise
   served up 20 million to 25 million ads in a month. According to Spider,
   the analytics firm that[37] discovered the scam, there are at least 202
   such sites tied to one bot network called Chameleon. Nearly all consist
   of little more than a smattering of cheap content you could pay a
   high-school student to write.

   There is also the egregious example of Directorslive.com, an obscure
   movie site that [38]AdWeek reports enjoys 326 million monthly
   pageviews. According to a source, the only site on the web to sell more
   ad impressions is Facebook.

Who is affected and who is responsible

   The list of advertisers that paid to appear on botnet sites include
   dozens of major brands, and cover a wide range of sectors such as:
   retail (Snickers, Ziploc, Petco); finance (Citi, Chase, Amex); telecom
   (AT&T, Time Warner, Sprint); automotive: (Dodge, Ford, Jaguar);
   services (Zipcar, Seamless).

   While advertisers are the direct victims of the botnet, major web
   publishers are also harmed because marketers lose confidence in the
   integrity of display advertising and prices drop accordingly.

   So who is to blame? An advertising source provided six ad networks it
   regarded as among those it believed to be "problematic" because their
   sites receive suspicious traffic. Here are their names along with an
   example of a suspect websites they control:  Alphabird
   (Driverswhoknow.com); Digimogul (USBuildingDigest.com); Forward Health
   (Womenshealthbase.com); Precision Media (Toothbrushing.net); HiFi
   network (Dailyfreshies.com); Relevad Corporation (FFog.net).

   (Clarification: the CEO of Spider.io says not all of these networks
   received visits from the Chameleon botnet but that they may be
   receiving traffic from other botnets or other "nefarious" sources).

   The CEO of Digimogul [39]told AdWeek that allegations of a connection
   to the bot network were "silly" and that "everything is by the book."
   Meanwhile, executives from Alphabird told me that they were surprised
   by the discovery of the botnet and that they're working with the London
   analytics firm to get to the bottom of it. Spider.io's CEO says that
   AlphaBird has reached out "via LinkedIn" but that the companies are not
   working together.

   I asked the COO of Alphabird, Justin Manes, how a company staffed by a
   sophisticated technology and marketing team could possibly remain
   unaware of the suspicious traffic -- especially when the traffic
   delivered a direct financial benefit to them. Manes responded that
   Alpahbird works with numerous aggregators to buy website visitors and
   that the corrupted traffic must have slipped in this way; he also
   declined to say where the company bought the traffic. As for the
   company's prospects in light of the botnet scandal, Manes said he hopes
   that people will come to see Alphaird was duped too; he also hopes the
   experience will strengthen the company's ability to sell tagging and
   tracking tools in the future.

Fixing the problem: better tools or law enforcement?

   The existence of a bot network that hijacks thousands of American
   computers to perpetrate millions of dollars in fraud appears to be a
   serious matter. But is it serious enough for a criminal investigation?

   I called the Cyber-Crimes division of the FBI to ask if it is
   investigated this type of activity. A spokesperson provided this
   response:

   "While I cannot comment about the botnet you're writing about, the
   FBI's Cyber Division does investigate botnets. We have had operational
   successes disrupting botnets used by individuals as well as groups that
   use malicious advertising as part of their schemes." The spokesperson
   also referred to a 2011 investigation known as "[40]Operation
   Ghostclick" in which the FBI arrested six people for using computers to
   manipulate the online ad industry.

   It's unclear at this point if the discovery of the new botnet will lead
   to any criminal investigations. In the meantime, brands and publishers
   will likely look to self-help solutions to weed out the fraud. There is
   some encouraging news on this front, as metrics companies like comScore
   are developing measurement tools to identify and screen-out what the
   company [41]calls "non-human traffic."

   This story was updated on March 20 at 10pm and March 21 at 11am to
   provide clarifications from Spider.io's CEO Douglas de Jager.

       problem is that many of these bot networks can also deliver human
       traffic. for example, malware infected browsers simply open up tabs
       on people's desktop sites and voila, there is a click to your
       webpage, perhaps even some real performance - yet the entire thing
       was done fraudulently.
       Focusing solely on `non human traffic' is missing a huge percentage
       of the problem.

       million ad impressions a month. Since the site shows four ad slots

       Actually, this loosely translates into 4 to 5 million page views,
       not visitors, a huge difference.

            Thanks for the comment, John. Yes, you're correct. "Visits"
            (or, or course "pageviews") may have been a better phrasing in
            order to indicate that many of those "visitors" were the same
            people (or bots).
            The point of the story was to explain to a general audience
            how a site like Toothbrushing could rival the ad views of the
            Economist. To do so, we were not as specific as we could have
            been (note we acknowledged it was a "rough calculation.") But
            I take your point.

                 You should update your piece then, because this error
                 makes a big chunk of your argument invalid. Visits are
                 not the same as unique visitors. So if you are doing 4-5
                 million pageviews and averaging 1.8 pages/visit, that's
                 roughly 2,222,222 visits (and uniques are probably less).
                 Which would be smaller traffic than the New Yorker or
                 Economist.
                 Your premise is correct though, these sites should not be
                 getting this amount of traffic.
