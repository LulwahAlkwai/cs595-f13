[4]Meetings are like sex

   Meetings are like sex. Everybody thinks that they are good at it...
   until they ask for the truth. We never have real discussions about it:
   I did not want to say anything... but you know this meeting thing? You
   are not very good at it.

   Meetings are like sex in the sense that they make most people happier
   about processes and decisions. However, it can also distract from real
   work.

   Meetings are also like sex in the sense that ideas might
   cross-pollinate and give rise to new ideas. But this cannot happen
   unless all partners are ready. And that is the main problem with most
   meetings: people fail to prepare them.

   There are simple rules that everyone should follow:
     * Meetings are about social interaction, they are not a substitute
       for real work. Research shows that computer-mediated collaboration
       leads to more focused and comprehensive decisions ([5]Kupritz and
       Cowell, 2011). In other words, meetings are not the right setting
       to write documents and reports. There are beautiful tools for
       collaborative writing: use them. If you have edits to propose, do
       it by email or edit the document directly. The same applies to
       software, drawings or technical specifications: they are not meant
       to be written during a meeting.
     * Contrary to a common belief, the meeting is a poor time to start
       reading the documents. Before the meeting, you should have pulled
       out all relevant data. If you are meeting to assess a colleague,
       you should have read his file beforehand... twice. If you are a
       student meeting his supervisor, you should have looked at all
       relevant references and you should have a written report available.
     * If you are planning to speak, prepare your talking points ahead of
       time. If needed, practice what you are going to say in your head.
       Make sure you are not rambling and wasting people's time. (But,
       please, don't prepare PowerPoint slides.)
     * If you have detailed information to share, please make it available
       ahead of time to the participants. During the meeting, assume that
       others have prepared the meeting and resist lengthy technical
       presentations.

   Remember: inefficient meetings can make entire teams, and even entire
   organizations, inefficient.

    1. IMHO, meetings should use the following algorithm
       For all action items I in 1..N:
       Action Item Closure(I)
       Action Item Follow Up(I)
       ENDFOR

    3. Another analogy: meetings are like mutexes, and should be treated
       as such.

    4. Does this blog post imply I should use Robert's Rules of Order in
       my bedroom?
