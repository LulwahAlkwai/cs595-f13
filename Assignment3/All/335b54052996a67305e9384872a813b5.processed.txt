   The Internet is disappearing. And with it goes an important part of our
   recorded history. That was the [49]conclusion of a study Technology
   Review looked at last year, which measured the rate at which links
   shared over social media platforms, such as Twitter, were disappearing.

   The conclusion was that this data is being lost at the rate of 11%
   within a year and 27% within two years.

   Today, the researchers behind this work reveal that all is not lost.
   Hany SalahEldeen and Michael Nelson at Old Dominion University in
   Norfolk, Va., have found a way to reconstruct deleted material, and
   they say it works reasonably well.

   First, some background. The pair began their work by studying the
   thousands of tweets, blog posts and other resources that were published
   during the 18 days of uprising in the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
   These resources were important, they say, because they provide a
   valuable record of a historic event.

   However, they also discovered that some of these posts and others on
   the web were disappearing and began to measure the rate at which they
   were vanishing. Hence the numbers given above.

   The new work is their attempt to reconstruct these missing posts and
   resources, at least in part, from the clues they leave behind on the
   web.

   SalahEldeen and Nelson began by attempting to confirm the earlier
   results, and that threw up a surprise.

   "An interesting phenomena occurred as several of the resources that
   were previously declared as missing became available again," they say.

   That's possible if the original disappearance was the result of a
   disrupted domain or archive that was later restored, or a user account
   that had been suspended and later reinstated.

   So SalahEldeen and Nelson wondered how it might be possible to find
   this resurrected material, even when it is no longer in its original
   cyber neighborhood. They point out that most shared resources leave
   traces elsewhere on the web, such as retweets, hashtags, comments and
   so on.

   The idea that SalahEldeen and Nelson came up with was to attempt to
   reconstruct a missing resource by searching for the traces left on the
   web. For that, they used the Twitter search engine Topsy, which allows
   them to enter the address of a missing resource and returns the tweets
   that refer to it. This is the resource's "tweet signature."

   They then extract the top five most frequent terms in this signature
   and use them as a search query in Google. The result is a list of
   potential replacements for the lost resource.

   An important question, of course, is how closely the replacement
   candidates match the original resource. To test this, SalahEldeen and
   Nelson carried out the same process for resources that had not
   disappeared and then compared the replacement candidates with the
   originals. They say the replacements had a 70% textual similarity to
   the original resource about 40% of the time.

   Not perfect, of course, but better than nothing. And perhaps given time
   it will become possible to do better.

   What's interesting is that this process is a kind of Internet
   archaeology that reconstructs a historical web page from the context in
   which it occurred. That's a fascinating new discipline.

   In the real world, archaeologists and anthropologists have become
   highly skilled at reconstructing natural history in this way. The
   conclusions that can be drawn from the discovery and analysis of a
   single tooth, for example, are truly astounding.

   There's no reason why Internet archaeologists cannot become just a
   skilled.
