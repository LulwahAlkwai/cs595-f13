   Abortion rights literature attacking the sponsors of House Bill 2.
   Implemented, HB 2 would ban abortions after 20 weeks and impose new
   medical standards on clinics abortion rights supporters say would
   shutter all but five clinics statewide.

   claimed to have confiscated what they suspected were jars of feces - a
   claim many protesters said was ridiculous.

   After the vote, the Capitol was cleared out. A line of DPS officers
   guards the Capitol's south entrance as a protester who wished to remain
   anonymous pleads to stop verbally harassing the officers.

   Update: The Senate has given a final vote to pass House Bill 2, passing
   it 19-11.

   Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst asked Senators that  "whether you're Christian,
   whether you're a person of faith, that we not forget to love each
   other." He said he felt goose bumps by seeing the orange and blue
   shirts in the gallery.

   Update: The fate of House Bill 2 has been decided for now. The Texas
   Senate voted preliminarily 19 to 11 to pass the measure, without any
   amendments.
   They need to give the bill a final vote before it would go to Gov. Rick
   Perry's desk for a signature.

   In the last stretch of the night, senators gave most of their most
   impassioned statements when they gave their closing remarks.

       the top of this page.

   "The indignant claims and insistent spin that this is about women's
   health and safety are bogus," State Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, said.
   "And I'm sorry to say, sometimes a little bit hypocritical."

   State Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, a supporter of the bill, disagreed.
   "I believe when a baby is destroyed we are destroying the image of
   God," he said.

   That prompted State Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, to say Sen. Patrick
   crossed the line by challenging the faith of those who vote against the
   bill. "Don't question the faith of any member on this floor," he said.

   State Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, is the lone Democrat who will
   vote in favor. "This is not a war on women. This is a war on children,"
   he said.

   Chanting outside the Senate chamber is particularly loud.
   Update: Some abortion rights protesters are questioning DPS' claim to
   have confiscated suspected jars of feces and urine. Here's KUT's
   reporting partners [92]The Texas Tribune with more:

     DPS officers outside the Senate gallery and at each entrance to the
     Capitol told The Texas Tribune they had not seen or found jars
     containing feces or urine, and multiple officers throughout the
     Capitol said they had not heard of any jars being found until a
     reporter mentioned it. Several officers also said they had not heard
     anything on the DPS radio system about jars of any excrement.

     On social media and in interviews, abortion rights protesters
     questioned the report, calling it an attempt by DPS to bolster
     Republican credibility during a contentious debate that has drawn
     national attention.

   Update: Despite earlier reports tampon and maxi pad confiscation would
   end for visitors going into the Senate Chambers, the Texas Department
   of Public Safety has issued a statement saying bag inspections will
   continue.

   DPS says it was tipped off to plans "to use a variety of items or props
   to disrupt legislative proceedings" today - leading to the bag searches
   and tampon confiscation. It says "inspections will continue until the
   conclusion of Senate business."

   Here's a description of what DPS says it's confiscated:

     During these inspections, DPS officers have thus far discovered one
     jar suspected to contain urine, 18 jars suspected to contain feces,
     and three bottles suspected to contain paint. All of these items -
     as well as significant quantities of feminine hygiene products,
     glitter and confetti possessed by individuals - were required to be
     discarded; otherwise those individuals were denied entry into the
     gallery.

   Update: There are reports that DPS has halted tampon confiscation.
   Abortion rights organizers Stand With Texas Women [93]credit Austin
   Sen. Kirk Watson with the reversal.

   The [94]Associated Press has more:

     State Sen. Kirk Watson of Austin called it a "boneheaded" and
     "crazy" decision to confiscate tampons as state troopers sought to
     take away items that could be thrown from the gallery.

     Watson says he's been assured that the practice will stop.

   KUT News has reached out to Watson's office for comment.

   Update: A spokesperson for State Rep. Jessica Farrar, D-Houston, says
   their office has offered to hold feminine products for women after one
   of their volunteers was shocked by the search.

   "They are embarrassed," says spokesperson Ariana Campos. "We had a
   woman in our office who showed up in tears because not only the items
   were not only confiscated but also shown to the rest of the group in
   line."

   DPS troopers were also asking women to throw away snacks and other
   items that could be thrown at senators from the gallery. KUT News has
   numerous calls in to DPS' main office for comment, but our calls have
   not been returned.

   Update: In Austin, [95]Twitter is exploding with reports that Texas
   Department of Public Safety officers are making women surrender their
   maxi pads and tampons before entering the Senate gallery. On the
   scene, KUT's Veronica Zaragovia confirms that DPS is asking women to do
   so.

   The reasoning? Fear the feminine hygiene products could be used as
   projectiles, thrown from the gallery onto the Senate floor, during
   the HB 2 debate. One [96]widely circulated photo shows other personal
   items, like energy bars, being confiscated as well.

   Original Post: Beginning at 2:30 p.m., the Texas Senate is set to
   debate and take a preliminary vote on House Bill 2, a measure that
   would restrict abortion in Texas. Here's an overview:
     * The last special session ended in a [97]historic filibuster by
       State Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, which some senators say kept
       them from expressing their opinions.

   "There were many of us that really wanted to speak in favor of the bill
   and opposition to the bill that didn't get that chance because of the
   filibuster," says Sen. [98]Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound. "So I think
   you'll see several senators, myself included. I want to talk about my
   support of this bill and why I do. So I think there'll be a lot of
   discussion."
     * Sen. [99]Royce West, D-Dallas, says discussion - not a filibuster -
       is all his party can do at this point.

   "We don't have the numbers to stop it," West said. "There's no way in
   the world you can filibuster for the rest of the month. It's just not
   humanly possible. But you will see, it'll be a good debate."

   The bill would ban abortion after 20 weeks of gestation and add
   requirements to clinics and physicians who perform the procedure.
   Here's [100]more on HB 2's abortion restrictions.

   What to expect today:

   The body is set to gavel in at 2 p.m., with debate expected to begin
   soon after.
     * Update: Shortly after 2 p.m., Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst announced the
       chamber will take up HB 2 shortly after 2:30 p.m.)

   While another Democratic filibuster is out of the question, that
   doesn't mean Ds won't try to stretch out the debate as long as
   possible. Debate could stretch into Saturday. After passing HB 2 on
   second reading, senators will have to wait 24 hours to pass it on third
   and final reading.
     * Update: The senate was able to pass HB 2 on third reading by
       adjourning after its passage on second reading, and immediately
       re-convening on a technically new day.

   The scene at the Capitol:

   Chanting has begun inside the Capitol dome, and the outpouring of
   emotions for and against HB 2 is expected to continue through the
   night. More than 1,500 people came to the Capitol by 11 a.m., and more
   than 200 Texas State Troopers are on hand.

   Some people began lining up at 2:30 a.m. - people like Art Stretton of
   Houston, who began the drive to Austin at about 11 p.m. last night. He
   brought with him a protein drink to withstand the hours he'd go today
   without food while sitting in one of the seats of the Senate gallery.
   The gallery has roughly 500 seats.

   Rich Deotte from Southlake said he got to the Capitol between 5 and 6
   a.m. "We want them to know we're behind them," he said, of lawmakers
   who will vote in favor of the bill.
