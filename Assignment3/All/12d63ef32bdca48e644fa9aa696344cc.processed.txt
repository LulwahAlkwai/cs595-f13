[4]Is genetically engineered intelligence worth it?

   We have been hearing reports that China is planning to [5]use genetic
   engineering to make its population smarter. In fact, there are claims
   that China has been practicing [6]eugenics for quite some time.
   ([7]Others think that this is rubbish.)

   In any case, the idea is on the table. Should we pursue
   genetic-engineering policies that would make future generations
   smarter? Should we try to create superb engineers and scientists
   through genetic manipulations?

   Let us leave aside the obvious ethical considerations involved. (Or
   what it tells us about Americans that they are entertaining such fears
   about China.) Let us just ask whether it would work.

   The core problem with this project is that our intelligence is not
   limited or defined by our brains. So far, computers have made us much
   smarter much faster than biology could. We have no idea how to design a
   brain that has Wikipedia at its virtual finger tips, or that can
   compute the first 10,000 digits of pi in less than a second... yet most
   of us have this power right now. A cheap smart phone can do these
   things easily. Our brains can't.

   As time passes, the fraction of our intelligence that is born out by
   our brain is less and less. This fraction was never 100%. Human beings
   build tools, they form communities. When times come to solve problems,
   they use this environment in their favor.

   In many ways, equipped with [8]Google Scholar, I am a much better
   scholar than 99.999% of all scholars that lived before we had the Web.
   In turn, the scholars that had access to large libraries (e.g., the
   [9]Library of Alexandria) were much better than those who did not.

   In a very real way, we are getting smarter and smarter, even if our
   brains are standing still biologically.

   What if, after a couple of generations (say 50 years), China could rise
   the average IQ of its population by 5 points using genetic engineering?
   How much would that matter? Probably not much at all. In 2060, the
   fraction of our intelligence that will depends on our brains will be
   tiny, assuming biological brains are even still relevant.

   Some might object that intelligence is more than just having access to
   information. They would object that there are brains that are truly
   superior in ways that computers cannot mimick. Let us take an example:
   chess. Playing a good game of chess was once the summon of raw
   intelligence. And the greatest chess player of all time is still with
   us: [10]Garry Kasparov. I am sure his brain is quite unique. Yet it did
   not stop computers from beating him. Again and again.

   Scientists will object that they are nothing like chess players. Their
   work is at a higher cognitive level. Maybe so, but Kasparov was beaten
   by a computer fifteen years ago. And back then, he accused IBM of
   cheating, because he saw true intelligence in how the computer was
   playing. It is absolutely certain that in 20 to 50 years, computers
   will generate original mathematics and science that will leave human
   beings behind.

   It does not mean that biology is uninteresting. I am generally
   favorable to any biological technology that can enhance intelligence.
   For example, it appears that amphetamines can boost intellectual
   performance substantially... at least for a time. I would be a user if
   it did not also have the side-effect of destroying your sex life. Short
   of using such strong drugs, I drink coffee and, thankfully, it looks
   like [11]taking coffee once per day does make you smarter.

   Yet I don't know any biological trick that can boost my intelligence
   like computers can. I also think that any long-term intelligence
   improvement strategy has to take into account that we are become
   hybrids, part machine, part human beings...

   In short: if China is really investing in a costly program to boost the
   intelligence of future generations using genetic engineering, they are
   wasting their time. I imagine my descendants having computer gear wired
   directly in their brains, or maybe living directly inside computers.

   Disclosure: I am a computer scientist, not a biologist.

    1. interesting read. I agree with you but the problem we have today is
       that majority of people are ignorant about the use of technology
       that would allow you to be much better scholar than 99.999% of all
       scholars that lived before we had the Web or they are just too dumb
       to learn how to use it.
       I also expect the side effect to be really bad or even fatal if
       they truly decide to go ahead with it.
       In the end, I believe what is stopping us from advancing in a
       faster and better pace is not that we are not smart enough but
       other factors such as greed, corruption and wars.
       good blog entry, keep them coming ;-)

    2. I suspect that [18]intelligence is a culturally dependent moving
       target. Most of our problems are social ones, and as such most of
       our `intelligence' goes towards engaging with others. Even in the
       supposed objectivity of science, a lot of what we do is networking,
       keeping an eye on trends, and figuring out how to convey our
       results to other humans. As such, it is not clear to me that
       computers are an enhancement of intelligence as much as they are a
       way to alter the definition more.

    3. Should we try for higher intelligence? Sure. Why not? On the other
       hand, what does that mean?
       Are we trying to raise the top end? In what way? Sure, we might
       come up with a list of attributes, but which matter? Which are most
       valuable? Do we know how to judge? Do we know how to design a
       better brain? Seems likely a lot of trial and error is needed.
       Are we trying to raise the middle? Or eliminate the low end? Ethics
       aside, this might be easier. Very tricky ground.
       Guess I am a bit more skeptical about the path to direct
       non-biologically enhanced intelligience. AI is still a dream.
       Direct mind to machine interfaces seem tricky. Decades away at
       least, probably several. The human brain does not have those sort
       of I/O ports. Might be an easier target for genetic engineering.
       Could the human brain be re-engineered to have structures suitable
       for machine interface? Could existing brains be retrofitted through
       gene therapy?
       We have a long way to go. Easier to eliminate the low end, and
       boost the middle. Ethics aside.

    4. Chess is a poor example for the superiority of computers over
       brains because it's a very simple game from a computational
       perspective. Chess AI is very different from the thought processes
       of human players (turn prediction vs pattern recognition). It just
       so happens that for chess specifically, the AI approach works
       better.
       Chess programs were historically used by AI research as an example
       for "being smarter than humans," but that was first a misconception
       and then a propaganda trick. Computers are still fairly terrible at
       things that brains have evolved to do well, such as pattern
       recognition itself (where it can't be substituted by something
       else) or navigating complex 3D environments.
       However, all this actually reinforces your main point: if you want
       to enhance human intelligence it's probably better to add
       complementary features (exact digital memory, high computational
       performance), rather than trying to improve on what the brain
       already does very well.

    5. Despite the ability to calculate 10k digits of pi, this does not
       seem to have enabled a broad-based revolution among the masses and
       lifted up millions of Archimedes. So just like always, that turns
       out to not be a significant limiting factor.

       A singularity could simply fail to happen. Software could bog down
       under its own weight. The AI Winter showed that while Moore's law
       marched own, it didn't have to be accompanied by great progress in
       AI related software or ideas.
       In which case 5 points could matter a fair bit. An exercise: 5
       points is 1/3 a standard deviation. If China is at 100 now and
       shifts to 105 in the future, how many times bigger is the fraction
       of the population with IQ >150?

    6. There's an interesting question implicit in your thoughts: Does
       technology add to our cognitive output or multiply it? Does
       Einstein with the internet further outshine his average peer, or
       does everybody approach him?

    7. I think this view of intelligence is both incorrect and immaterial.
       One of the most important aspects of intelligence is our ability to
       make decisions.
       This is very involved, and has little to do with how much we know.
       It has everything to do with how we weigh that knowledge, determine
       what is relevant to the case in point, and our personal history
       with similar decisions. Large databases don't help very much except
       as a tool to providing our brains with a lot of information.
       Some very recent research indicates that Glial cells have a direct
       contribution to intelligence (as evidenced by better decision
       making). Human glial cells directly injected into new-born mice
       have had statistically significant effect in increasing
       intelligence.
       This is very extraordinary both from the perspective of
       trans-species transplant, and also from the fact that hithertoo,
       glial cells were not known to be a factor in intelligence.

       I think this is very wrong. One of the constant trends in studying
       human expertise and in AI is that to a large degree, making good
       decisions is due to a huge amount of data. You should check out the
       _Cambridge Handbook_ on the topic, but the basic point is:
       expertise develops slowly and gradually, scales with the number of
       examples processed, the faster feedback is the more skills develop
       (as expected, since supervised learning > unsupervised learning),
       case studies like chess masters show that they depend on thousands
       of games and fragments stored in long-term memory as a key part of
       how they analyze any position (rather than, say, larger working
       memory or deep evaluation of many plys), expert systems can reach
       near-human performance levels in domains by absorbing on the order
       of (just) thousands of items of expert-elicited data, and machine
       learning has observed that even simple algorithms can continue to
       increase performance if given huge amounts of raw data (most
       famously in Norvig's paper `The unreasonable effectiveness of
       data'). Then you have the constant divide in the heuristics &
       biases psychological literature between `system I' and `system II'
       thought, where most thought and tasks are done via fast frugal
       system I pattern recognition (but how do you `recognize' without
       knowledge?), and not slow serial system II thought where logic and
       reasoning are employed.

    9. This post is based on a totally biased observation. If you are not
       a racist, please first find out the facts of China using Eugenic.
       Yes. There is birth-control, the so called one-child policy.
       However, this policy results in more spoiled children than smarter
       children. The new government is considering to stop this policy.
       Comment by Anonymous -- 19/3/2013 @ [32]9:51
   10. @Anonymous
       At no point do I state that China is pursuing eugenics. I even
       link, in my first paragraph, to a post that says that this is not
       true.
       What I can do is play thought experiments... what if China did it?
       Anyhow, if you have a better reference proving that China is not
       pursuing eugenics, beyond the one I offer, please share it with us.

   11. It looks to me as though you are confusing intelligence with
       information. Simply being able to access vast amounts of
       information doesn't actually improve your intelligence, just your
       education. There are entirely too many highly educated idiots to
       make that a worthwhile pursuit.
       I am all for information, but the matrix within which the human
       being must function isn't all about information, but the moral and
       long term affects of using that information in a beneficial manner.

   12. Just one thing really, the Flynn
       effect([36]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) never came up
       in the discussion till now. Funnily enough the raw intelligence of
       the world has been increasing since the time the IQ test was
       invented. Effectively China, IF we gave in to the idea that they
       were artificially boosting pattern recognition abilities(who knows
       the true definition of intelligence anyway?), then they would have
       to also get ahead of the curve, or maybe they would just boost the
       Flynn effect itself... Who knows?

       I was implicitly referring to the Flynn effect in the sense that by
       all accounts, we are getting smarter (measurably so) with each
       passing generation... and that's not due to genetics!

       important.
       Comment by [45]Kristina -- 21/3/2013 @ [46]9:35
   16. I agree with Doreen on this matter.
       When it comes to the Flynn effect - wiki gives some ideas of what
       could be causing it. The fact that information are more available
       with technology can in great deal contribute to what and how we
       think, but saying that it is such a big factor in the intelligence
       means neglecting the nature in the nature-vs-nurture debate.
       Indeed, there are big correlations between intelligence of children
       in studies involving the identical siblings raised in different
       families (they have the same genes). Something that should be taken
       into account.
       When it comes to genes and intelligence - people with similar
       intelligence tend to stick together. A good question would be
       whether there is natural selection guided by our own choice of a
       partner. So, if we have a choice of a partner, do we peek the one
       who is a bit "simple", the one that is "on the same level", or the
       one that "amazes us"?.

   17. I am disappointed in this discussion: is it possible to genetically
       produce a being intelligent enough to solve the problem of
       how to manipulate the space/time fabric so that we may leave this
       planet and exploit other planets that are as of yet untainted by
       pollution?
