                      Scientists create light from vacuum

   Scientists create light from vacuum [12]Enlarge

   In the Chalmers scientists' experiments, virtual photons bounce off a
   "mirror" that vibrates at a speed that is almost as high as the speed
   of light. The round mirror in the picture is a symbol, and under that
   is the quantum electronic component (referred to as a SQUID), which
   acts as a mirror. This makes real photons appear (in pairs) in vacuum.

   (PhysOrg.com) -- Scientists at Chalmers University of Technology have
   succeeded in creating light from vacuum - observing an effect first
   predicted over 40 years ago. The results will be published tomorrow
   (Wednesday) in the journal Nature. In an innovative experiment, the
   scientists have managed to capture some of the photons that are
   constantly appearing and disappearing in the vacuum.

   The experiment is based on one of the most counterintuitive, yet, one
   of the most important principles in [13]quantum mechanics: that
   [14]vacuum is by no means empty nothingness. In fact, the vacuum is
   full of various particles that are continuously fluctuating in and out
   of existence. They appear, exist for a brief moment and then disappear
   again. Since their existence is so fleeting, they are usually referred
   to as virtual particles.

   Chalmers scientist, Christopher Wilson and his co-workers have
   succeeded in getting [15]photons to leave their virtual state and
   become real photons, i.e. measurable light. The physicist Moore
   predicted way back in 1970 that this should happen if the virtual
   photons are allowed to bounce off a mirror that is moving at a speed
   that is almost as high as the speed of light. The phenomenon, known as
   the dynamical Casimir effect, has now been observed for the first time
   in a brilliant experiment conducted by the Chalmers scientists.

   "Since it's not possible to get a mirror to move fast enough, we've
   developed another method for achieving the same effect," explains Per
   Delsing, Professor of Experimental Physics at Chalmers. "Instead of
   varying the physical distance to a mirror, we've varied the electrical
   distance to an electrical short circuit that acts as a mirror for
   microwaves.

   The "mirror" consists of a quantum electronic component referred to as
   a SQUID (Superconducting quantum interference device), which is
   extremely sensitive to magnetic fields. By changing the direction of
   the magnetic field several billions of times a second the scientists
   were able to make the "mirror" vibrate at a speed of up to 25 percent
   of the speed of light.

   "The result was that photons appeared in pairs from the vacuum, which
   we were able to measure in the form of microwave radiation," says Per
   Delsing. "We were also able to establish that the radiation had
   precisely the same properties that quantum theory says it should have
   when photons appear in pairs in this way."

   What happens during the experiment is that the "[16]mirror" transfers
   some of its kinetic energy to virtual photons, which helps them to
   materialise. According to quantum mechanics, there are many different
   types of virtual particles in vacuum, as mentioned earlier. Göran
   Johansson, Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics, explains that
   the reason why photons appear in the experiment is that they lack mass.

   "Relatively little energy is therefore required in order to excite them
   out of their virtual state. In principle, one could also create other
   particles from vacuum, such as electrons or protons, but that would
   require a lot more energy."

   The scientists find the photons that appear in pairs in the experiment
   interesting to study in closer detail. They can perhaps be of use in
   the research field of quantum information, which includes the
   development of quantum computers.

   However, the main value of the experiment is that it increases our
   understanding of basic physical concepts, such as vacuum fluctuations -
   the constant appearance and disappearance of virtual particles in
   vacuum. It is believed that vacuum fluctuations may have a connection
   with "dark energy" which drives the accelerated expansion of the
   universe. The discovery of this acceleration was recognised this year
   with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics.

     One of the most surprising predictions of modern quantum theory is
     that the vacuum of space is not empty. In fact, quantum theory
     predicts that it teems with virtual particles flitting in and out of
     existence. ...these vacuum fluctuations had measurable consequences,
     for instance producing the Lamb shift of atomic spectra and
     modifying the magnetic moment for the electron.

   Dense aether theory models space-time like the density gradient of
   particle environment, for example the 4D space-time with 3D water
   surface. This surface is full of Brownian noise, which manifests for
   example with quantum noise of atoms of helium, which never freeze at
   room pressure. The helium atoms play a role of pollen grains at the
   water surface, which are under wild motion, when being observed under
   the microscope.

   If we consider the literal experiment of moving a physical mirror near
   the speed light, we quickly see that this experiment is not feasible.
   For example the case of moving a typical microwave mirror in an
   oscillating motion at frequency of 2 GHz with a displacement of 1 nm
   would produce 1 photon per day. Nevertheless, it would require an input
   of mechanical power of 100 MW while the system would need to be cooled
   to 20 mK temperature to ensure that the EM field is in its vacuum
   state.
   But this arrangement could be achieved with fast rotating mirror more
   easily. For example, if we would make one half of rotating rod black
   and the second one reflective, this rod would generate the photons from
   vacuum, if it would rotate with megahertz frequency speed - which is
   achievable even with contemporary technology.

   The problem isn't the rotation speed but the extreme precision with
   which the two surfaces must be aligned. Getting one (or two) rapidly
   rotating surfaces to within one nanometer of one another - and keeping
   them there - is something we haven't achived yet.

   You're just confusing the observation of Casimir force with observation
   of dynamic Casimir effect. Dynamic Casimir effect doesn't use any
   coplanar mirrors.

   Bit hard to show them 'appearing AND disappearing' since then you
   couldn't measure them. We're talking virtual photons here - not real
   ones.
   In order to make them real you need to have something like the dynamic
   Casimir effect (as described in the article) or some other extreme
   condition (e.g. near a black hole horizon) which gives them enough of a
   boost to become real or (as in the black hole example) separate them
   enough for them to become real (which is what Hawking radiation is).
   Once they are real they don't disappear again.
   Another related effect may be Unruh radiation (which - like Hawking
   radiation - hasn't been observed, yet)
   But the static Casimir effect has been demonstrated (i.e. that
   _something_ is going on in vacuum which can be described as virtual
   photons popping in and out of existence)

   They're called virtual because they're shortliving. CMBR photons are

   Temporarily? 13 billion years flight time is 'temporarily'? Also the

   This is just a Big Bang theory BS. In AWT the CMBR photons appear and
   disappear all around us like the Brownian noise at the water surface
   and their density and intensity is permanent.
   [88]http://people.rit...4565.jpg
   The space-time "expands" even for ripples spreading along the water
   surface, but it doesn't mean, something really expands here. BTW The
   recent observations indicating, the various effects of red shift (like
   the integrated Sachs-Volfe effect) disappear just for CMBR photons.
   [89]http://www.tgdail...t-at-all
   It means, in microwave light the Universe is steady state, without red
   shift and nonexpanding. It implies, the red shift is dispersive effect
   and the galaxies inside of the Hubble deep field are experiencing the
   same CMBR noise, like we do.

   Wouldn't that mean that all bodies are permanently bombarded by freshly

   inefinitely). I think we're running into Olber's paradox with this type
   of 'theory'.
   Or do the photons then emitted as radiation suddenly, magically
   disappear again?
   I.e. are there disappearing and non-disappearing photons? Sound s a ot

   The problem with mainstream physics isn't, it uses some theory for
   explanation of observation, but in the fact, it ignores the other
   alternative models, which lead into the same predictions and in some
   cases they fit the observations better. It's actually the same
   religion, like those which Holy Church used in medieval ages. Holy
   Church didn't prohibit the formal models, like the geocentric epicycle
   model of solar system. It was highly scientific approach in its time.
   The religious trait of this approach consisted in the point, it ignored
   all alternative explanations.
   In this sense the modern astronomy doesn't differ from medieval
   astronomy at least a bit. Both they're using formal models for
   explanation of observations and both they're denying the alternative
   models being religious, not critical thinking based. We actually made
   no conceptual progress in application of scientific method.

     Or do the photons then emitted as radiation suddenly, magically

   Of course, in the same way, like the Brownian noise penetrating the
   water surface. The CMBR photons aren't real photons - they're virtual,
   just quite long living photons. They're representing gravitational
   waves as well.

     I think we're running into Olber's paradox with this type of
     'theory'

   Actually, just the Big Bang model leads into Olber's type paradoxes
   instead. It predicts, whole distant sky would be covered with quite
   energetic shortwavelength photons. Under such a situation the clouds of
   interstellar gas couldn't condense into dense stars at all - they
   should remain excited and glowing too.

   The CMBR photons are the analogy of thermal fluctuations of atmosphere,
   which are prohibiting us in observation of stars through telescopes.
   Most of light is dispersed with much smaller and faster fluctuations,
   which manifest with Rayleigh dispersion and with blue light of
   atmosphere. But these tiny fluctuations doesn't interfere the optical
   observations. Only the tiny fraction of these fluctuations of longest
   wavelength is directly observable with naked eye as the twinkling of
   stars - but they're as virtual, as these shortwavelength ones by their
   nature. There is no qualitative difference between thermal noise of
   atmosphere responsible for Rayleigh dispersion and the thermal noise
   responsible for twinkling of stars. In the same way, AWT assumes, there
   is no qualitative difference between CMBR photons and the virtual
   particles forming the vacuum. The later ones are just smaller.

   Olber's paradox happens when you have an _infinite_ power source in a
   (in)finite space. The CMBR was a _finite_ power source in a finite
   space. So no: The BB doesn't run into Olber's paradox. Your
   'explanation' of continuous creation of photons, however, does.
   If photons appeared and disappeared all the time we wouldn't be able to
   see distant stars at all - because the photons emitted from them would
   be as likely to disappear than photons from any other direction would
   appear.
   Oh, and gravity is a bit of another kettle of fish - has nothing to do
   with electromagnetic radiation.

     If photons appeared and disappeared all the time we wouldn't be able
     to see distant stars at all

   And we really aren't able to do so. This is the reason, why we cannot
   see the more distant objects, so that the sky remain dark. It's called
   the particle horizon of Universe.
   Actually, the AWT doesn't deny the Big Bang model. It predicts, at the
   very distant future the Universe is just random and all theories will
   become indistinguishable each other. But there is no phenomena, which
   the tired light model cannot explain as easily, as the Big Bang model.
   And the tired light model fits some recent observations better.
   Paradoxically, some phenomena like the Doppler's anisotropy of red
   shift, which are seemingly violating the Big Bang model by now can
   actually serve for its support later into account of tired light model.
   Because the tired light model is quite spatially symmetric by its very
   nature and it predicts very uniform Universe.

   IMO it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the aether subject.
   "Tell me," he asked a friend, "why do people always say, it was natural
   for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that
   the earth was rotating?" His friend replied, "Well, obviously because
   it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth." Wittgenstein
   replied, "Well, what would it have looked like if it had looked as
   though the Earth was rotating?"
   We can now ask as well: "How the universe would appear if it had looked
   like being eternal and infinite and the red shift would be a
   consequence of the dispersion of light at vacuum fluctuations"?
   Apparently, many people today aren't willing to even think about it at
   all, thus effectively behaving in the same shortseeing way, like the
   opponents of Galileo in his era.

   Since they appear -- and thus are real -- for a very short period of
   time -- are they affected by gravity and would a huge vaccum like inter
   galactic space have a significant amount of these particles pooping
   into and out of existance -- if so does this effect galactic rotation?

     if so does this effect galactic rotation?

   The phenomena like the Lense-Thirring effect and dark matter effects
   can be interpreted like the drag induced with virtual particles in
   vacuum. In certain sense they're behaving like the sparse gas composed
   of colliding particles and/or aether of preEinsteinian era. So it's not
   accidental, the equations describing gravitomagnetic effects are
   isomorphous with Maxwell's equations and with Navier-Stokes equations
   for elastic fluid.
   [101]http://www.aether...hism.gif
   So-called the Einstein's aether theory is based on this insight.
   [102]http://en.wikiped...r_theory

   point, it implies wavelength dependence for all phenomenological
   predictions.

   Because with these photons spontaneously popping into existence we
   shouldn't be able to create something like working photomultipliers at

   a lot of people have discovered similar things. Its more about showing
   that there is no science behind the science as we know it now. Because

   If a future device (version 2.0) based on this principle could create
   protons, as it is mentioned in the article, could it be an efficient
   way to accelerate space probes?
   I mean, if you can pick up mass from the void you do not need to carry
   mass, only energy is needed in order to keep the mirror
   rotating/vibrating. The new protons would appear in the nozzle and sent
   backwards to create thrust, or they could be accelerated more with ion
   engines. The required energy could be harvested from solar panels,
   nuclear decay, or fission (in the last cases you still need to carry
   mass in the form of plutonium, but you do not need to carry a huge

     Since they appear -- and thus are real -- for a very short period of
     time -- are they affected by gravity and would a huge vaccum like
     inter galactic space have a significant amount of these particles
     pooping into and out of existance -- if so does this effect galactic
     rotation?

   Most likely negligible. The ratio of gravitational energy imparted from
   baryonic matter versus EM radiation is absolutely huge. Consider the
   mass of a photon.
   Or look at it this way: Divide the energy of a photon by the speed of
   light squared to get its mass. the number you get is absurdly small.
   Then, divide THAT number by the actual time spent in existence. It
   becomes...even more absurd.
   And that's before you get into all the other theoretical work on the
   fabric of space.

   Probably not. However, efficiency might take a back seat given the
   truly enormous travel times we'll face getting anywhere extrasolar -
   and the shere impossibility of doing that using any kind of
   reaction-fuel-driven vehicle). But it's probably more efficient to
   drive a big flashlight using the energy gained from any powerplant and
   use that as a 'thruster' than going for dynamic Casimir effect drives.

   This is not a measurable discernible effect. By involving variables
   (mirrors, atoms, photons, in this case magnetic field) you cannot
   separate causation of the photon pair.
   The magnetic field created to oscillate space (the virtual particle
   pairs) lends its energy into the pairs derivation from the vacuum. The
   mirror is in effect producing the photons.
   Phonons are converted to photons. The phonons release their potential
   becoming kinetic, the virtual photons fulfill their potential becoming
   kinetic. The virtual photons become real (lose their virtuosity) by
   absorbing the phonons energy.
   This is not energy from vacuum. The mirrors (magnetic fields) are
   filling the vacuum with their energy. The mirrors energy in the vacuum
   is forming new (real) particles which without the mirrors energy would
   be virtual.

   The ratio of mass energy equivalence from an electron (At rest) to a
   photon looks to be something on order of at least 5 Octillion (10x27)
   to 1. add another 3 zeros to get the ratio for a proton.
   Now, compare those numbers to the number of atoms in 'empty

   Ok, we have established that the quantum vacuum is real. Now would IT
   be equivalent to the 'hyperspace' of so many science 'fiction' stories.
   If it 'is, and with a lot of energy baryonic matter can be coaxed out
   of it, maybe with a 'release' of energy baryonic matter can be put back
   into the quantum vacuum. That would make the quantum vacuum an energy
   source, put matter in, get energy out. Moreover, what about the
   integrity of the matter put in...can you get the same particles out
   that was put in?....there for implying a bit of localization in the
   'quantum vacuum/hyperspace'. Carrying further, can we put an 'object'
   into this 'space' and get it out undamaged? Or maybe later put an
   object in in one place with some maneuverability, and get it out

   ** The LHC is a maschine that doesnt smash partikels appart but creates
   new ones from the vacuum by using the energy of the destroyed ones
   ** you can use energy to create electrons, put them into a electric
   field so that they accelerate, therby create light (energy, e.g by
   exiting gas) and then put them back to the vaccum before they destroy
   the dipole that creates the electric field. -> tada free energy

   No because those potential waves are not reflected back coherently from

   from a completely imaginary 3D projection [space,vacuum] into an vector

   "have the photons previously been observed in vacuum?" - NerdGuy
   The photons are virtual. Thus by definition they are not observed.
   What can be observed is their effects. Vandervan der Waals forces are
   thought to be an example of the exclusion of some virtual photons from
   the void, causing a net inward force between two atoms or objects on
   the atomic scale.
   In addition there have been various tests performed that show within
   the limits of experimental error that forces between conducting plates,
   or a ball and plate are manifestations of the exclusion of virtual
   photons from the gap between plate and plate/ball.
   The unfortunate thing about virtual EM particles is that the energy of
   photon pairs sums to zero. Meaning that one has negative energy.
   Consider the following.
   A neutral atom is moving from right to left and somewhere left of the
   atom a photon/photon virtual particle pair is created. Presume that one
   is moving left and the other right.

   Photons are real particles and they're commonly detected. The EM force

   After a time t, the virtual photons will be separated by a distance of
   2ct. Now have the atom absorb the right most photon, making the left
   most photon real.
   That photon will become real at a distance of 2ct from the point at
   which it's anti-twin was absorbed.
   Since t can be set to any time we please, and since the photon at 2ct
   can actually pair with other virtual photons in the vacuum, the
   distance between the absorption of the virtual photon and the
   realization of the real photon on the left can be any distance from the
   atom with the most probable value being at 2ct.

   "Photons are real particles." - Callippo
   What is real or not real depends upon your frame of reference.
   When an excited atom loses energy via a photon, that photon falls into
   and mixes with a sea of virtual photons that fill the void. When a
   photon of similar energy, polarization, momentum etc. is observed, is
   it the photon that fell in? Or is it another? Has the photon been
   disassembled and recomposed, or did it ever exist in the first place?

   "If other virtual particles can theoretically be created in this
   fashion, could it be possible that virtual neutrinos could also be
   "created"?" - Trigger
   Not necessarily through the exact mechanism utilized here, but in
   principle any particle pair can be realized.
   The term "create" is inappropriate because nothing is being created.
   The particle/antiparticle pairs are always there although they form
   more of a web of interactions rather than simple pairs.
   It is important to note how short a time these virtual pairs "exist".
   On average they hardly exist long enough to call them particles. They
   are more like momentary variances in the charge/energy density of the
   vacuum.
   It isn't as if they live long enough to separate a distance equal to
   their own wavelength. But with an accelerating conductive plate you can
   take some of the charge displacement that is attracted to the plate and
   by moving the plate, pull the charge farther from it's anti-twin, thus
   separating them enough 2 be real

   influenced by such virtual particles" - Trigger
   Any individual measurement can be influenced yes. However on average
   you will get as much positive as you would negative so it will average
   to zero.
   You might consider what happens to a virtual particle pair that are
   sitting less than their wavelength away from the event horizon of a
   black hole.
   What happens to the component that appears inside the event horizon,
   and what can happen to the component that appears outside?

   I've no problem with it, I'm just saying, the virtual photon concept
   violates the relativity. So you should present it as a your private
   theory here for not to confuse other posters. (Actually, whole the
   photon concept violates the relativity, but it's another story.)

   The current record in absence of decoherence is 17 km or so. So we can
   be sure, at the distance of 17 km the photon can remain unchanged.

     "have the photons previously been observed in vacuum?" - NerdGuy
     The photons are virtual. Thus by definition they are not observed.

   FROM THE ARTICLE: "Chalmers scientist, Christopher Wilson and his
   co-workers have succeeded in getting photons to leave their virtual
   state and become real photons, i.e. measurable light. "
   Hmmm...not sure you are on the same page Vendicar. The whole point is
   Chalmers is able to make these things observable. That's not in
   dispute. My only question is, outside of Chalmer's ability to make this
   happen at-will, have we previously recorded any observations. Looks
   like the answer is no.

     , outside of Chalmer's ability to make this happen at-will, have we
     previously recorded any observations. Looks like the answer is no

   The CMBR photons are tangible evidence of TEMPORAL formation of photons
   just from vacuum. The were observed in 1964 already and everyone can
   detect them with his analog TV set. The vibrating mirror just shifts
   the equilibrium of the consecutive photon formation and annihilation
   (it makes it more local) - but this process occurs all the time with
   microwave photons spontaneously. We aren't required to build expensive
   devices for its detection.

   It does only if you work on the assumption that two particles with the
   same quantum numbers (excluding position) are the same particle.
   In QM the speed of light is infinite, but measures as finite as a
   result of the interaction of photons with the vacuum sea.

   "Hmmm...not sure you are on the same page Vendicar. The whole point is

   No. He claims to have made them real. If your question is "has anyone
   ever made virtual photons real", the answer is yes. Through a wide
   variety of means including chemistry since the binding energy of two
   atoms is greater than the computed binding energy based on charge
   alone. The extra energy liberated is hence a conversion of vacuum
   energy into "real" energy.
   These vacuum fluctuations comprise the bulk of QM. Without them nothing
   would work. Even something like a proton obtains the vast majority of
   it's mass from field fluctuations inside the proton.
   It is these fluctuations that also make the neutron and other
   radioactive particles unstable.
   They underlay virtually everything in QM.

     "The CMBR photons are tangible evidence of TEMPORAL formation of

     is slim.

   It just follows from dense aether model. The Brownian noise at the
   water surface arises in the same way and the water surface analogy
   explains/predicts many other things as well. The approach of mainstream
   science by now is strictly deterministic, it doesn't handle well the
   subtle, but widespread indicia. The ten of 10% evidences is still zero
   net evidence for people like you with schematic black & white vision of
   reality. Such people don't accept the cold fusion, aether theory or
   whatever else paradigm, until they find the 100% evidence for it. But
   after then such evidence becomes a subject of convinced religion and
   they cannot accept anything else.
   Whereas for me the reality appears much more fuzzy. I'm willing to
   consider much weaker evidences both for, both against established
   theories, because it fits well with my emergent philosophy.

   Believe it or not, the existence of virtual particles doesn't follow
   from (postulates of) any mainstream theory. Neither quantum theory,
   neither relativity theory requires nor expects such things. For me the
   existence of virtual particles serves as an apparent evidence of
   particle model of vacuum - simply because no other model can predict,
   neither explain such thing.

   because of God's will or something similar? Probably not.

     Neither quantum theory, neither relativity theory requires nor

   QM is what predicts them. Via the Uncertainty Principle you can't have

   Most people don't realize, that the quantum uncertainty is a product of

   vacuum in similar fuzzy way, like we would observe the tiny objects at
   the water surface with its surface ripples. The Brownian noise would
   make all observations of tiny objects fuzzy.

   I've no problem with science, just with religious trolls, which are
