[11]Yahoo's Logo Reveals the Worst Aspects of the Engineering Mindset

   [12]Glenn Fleishman [13]September 6, 2013

   Marissa Mayer is not a graphic designer. This is abundantly clear. She
   is an extraordinarily capable technologist, engineer, and executive,
   and she has made an enormous number of difficult decisions since taking
   over Yahoo. I believed she was likely the only person who had the
   ability to turn that company around.

   But she's not a graphic designer.

   Graphic design isn't about snowing a client into believing a story you
   spin. Graphic design is about understanding the way in which type,
   color, shape, and other factors may communicate specific feelings or
   facts. It is about legibility, optics, psychology, and more. One
   doesn't train in design to make posters or logos. One trains to develop
   an increasingly intuitive sense of what works and why. Focus groups
   don't help in the design process, although they can assist (as can the
   market, in terms of sales or response) in determining whether the
   intended meaning and feelings are conveyed.

   Too many people think graphic design is not a specialty, but something
   anyone can do, because the tools to make decent-looking Web pages,
   newsletters, books, and the like are readily available. But design
   isn't putting stuff on a page. It's about solving visual problems
   through an iterative process of decisionmaking, which may involve
   consultation, or may happen in private. If you can't master that
   process, you can't work in the field. No one will hire you because your
   work looks obviously bad to any trained eye, and is interpreted poorly
   by any untrained eye.

   The Yahoo logo design process represents the worst aspects of someone
   who doesn't understand or accept that type design, typography, and
   graphic design in general are professions that benefit from years or
   decades of training. Mayer [14]explains the process they employed to
   create the new logo. If I had attempted to present the reasoning she
   used to any of my graphic design teachers in college, any of the people
   I worked for at studios or on a freelance basis, or to a client who had
   hired me, I would have been laughed at and told to get real, or fired.

   Mayer clearly appreciates the expertise and insight of folks who write
   code at Yahoo, run the servers, handle human resources, and the like.
   But, apparently, sees graphic design as something she is equally
   qualified to participate in without domain knowledge. Steve Jobs also
   saw himself as a designer, but from the decades of stories about how he
   worked, he generally demanded iteration, and selected and guided the
   direction of interfaces, print materials, and products, rather than
   leaping in with his own design execution.

   Paul Rand for IBM.

   My first design teacher, Philip Burton, used to say, over and over,
   don't be anecdotal. He would say, when we were presented with a design
   task in class, most of which were abstract in nature, that we weren't
   making rebuses. (Paul Rand's [15]famous IBM ad is a design joke and
   intended to be amusing, not the company's new logo.) What Philip meant
   about anecdote is that we should not be looking for a literal rendition
   of what we wanted to represent, but rather a figurative one.

   There is a break in childhood development: a point at which you move
   from concrete to abstract thinking. Some people never get there.
   Engineers, software or otherwise, use an enormous amount of abstract
   thinking, but some also often appear rooted in the concrete for
   everything but math and science. For them, visual and literary
   aesthetics involve a literal reading: if you say one thing but mean the
   other, you're not making sense to them. The idea of gray areas,
   shading, or things that they can't immediately grasp fully are
   rejected. When I read Mayer's explanation, I feel like I'm peering into
   the mind of an engineer.

   I'll leave a more detailed and excellent critique of the design process
   and actual design to Oliver Reichenstein of iA, who wrote  "[16]Logo,
   Bullshit & Co., Inc." Yes to everything he said. But I want to make a
   specific point about type design.

   Mayer and her team adapted Optima, one of the first humanist sans
   serifs: the swell of the letter implies a serif and lacks the more
   straight and geometric (not mathematical) edges of many grotesk sans
   serifs, like Helvetica. Designed by Hermann Zapf, one of the greatest
   type designers of the last century, Optima has a slight softness to it
   that makes it perfect for non-fiction prose, where a grotesk would seem
   too severe. Optima, like his Palatino and Melior, are all around us.
   (Zapf is 94 and still kicking, and I will be curious if he will have
   anything to say.)

   Now, it's not sacrilege to modify a type design; there are licensing
   issues, but there's nothing sacrosanct about it. Apple famously had
   Bitstream make an extra-compressed version of Garamond that became its
   standard font, and which never looked wonderful to my eyes. But to make
   changes to a face while ignoring the entire history of the written word
   and coming up on 600 years of movable type used for Western alphabets
   is ludicrous.

   Those born into the age of advanced electronics and the Internet are
   always inclined to discard the past and start fresh. A tabula rasa is
   wonderful, but only if there is literally nothing to learn from
   history. The worst thing about Amazon.com in its early days (I ran the
   book-information department for six months in 1996-97) wasn't the hours
   nor disorganization nor some of the personality problems of early hires
   given too much authority. It was a great place to work in many ways.

   The worst thing was that there was an assumption that there were no
   lessons to learn from anyone in the book industry or with any knowledge
   of warehouse logistics or shipping. I argue that Amazon wasted billions
   of dollars and a substantial fraction of its person-hours until about
   2001 by reinventing every single thing from scratch instead of
   carefully examining what worked and what didn't. (Barnes & Noble is the
   cautionary tale on the other extreme, launching its site relying only
   on what it knew and had on hand.)

   Mayer writes:

     We wanted there to be a mathematical consistency to the logo, really
     pulling it together into one coherent mark.

   If there is one sentence in the entire blog post that tells the whole
   story, that is it. This shows that not only does she lack an
   understanding of design -- which is fine, it's not where her strengths
   lie -- but that she also doesn't know it; that designers consulted were
   unable to disabuse her of this ridiculous notion; and that the final
   result pleased her, when it is obviously flawed in this regard.

   The only type designs that are "mathematically consistent" are used for
   computer-readable purposes, such as fonts developed to be
   [17]magnetically scanned off checks. All other faces, including
   monospaced faces used in text editors or for developing software and
   ones that simulate monospaced or proportionately spaced typewriter
   letters, are designed for optical consistency.

   Designing for mathematical consistency ignores three related factors:
   that identical widths and shapes appear differently to the eye in
   different combinations within a letter or glyph; that identical shapes
   blend together and are harder to differentiate across words and lines;
   that letters in a typeface are placed alongside each other, and one
   must adjust to deal with common juxtapositions.

   The human eye is insanely good at spotting things that look off. A bad
   typeface looks bad to people who aren't trained in design, because it
   lacks a visual fluidity that good type has. The same is true with a
   logotype, like Yahoo's.

   Type evolved from writing with a stylus or brush which evolved from
   chiseling, carving, and other earlier methods (still employed).
   Humanity didn't first invent a form of representing speech of ideas and
   require the mind and eye to catch up. We produced things that were
   consonant with our ability to interpret them.

   Technology has fooled us into thinking that we invent first and train
   our minds later. Our minds are prefabricated to read type as it has
   evolved, because type evolved to interoperate with our visual cortex
   and our neural structure. Our brains haven't suddenly changed.

   Ignoring the development of useful things that developed alongside us
   is arrogant and misguided.

   When I look at the Yahoo logo, I have far less hope for its future.
