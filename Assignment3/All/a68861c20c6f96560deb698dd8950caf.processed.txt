Unpatched Mac bug gives attackers "super user" status by going back in time

Exploiting the five-month-old "sudo" flaw in OS X just got easier.

   Researchers have made it easier to exploit a five-month-old security
   flaw that allows penetration testers and less-ethical hackers to gain
   nearly unfettered "root" access to Macs over which they already have
   limited control.

   The [11]authentication bypass vulnerability was reported in March and
   resides in a Unix component known as sudo. While the program is
   designed to require a password before granting "super user" privileges
   such as access to other users' files, the bug makes it possible to
   obtain that sensitive access by resetting the computer clock to January
   1, 1970. That date is known in computing circles as the [12]Unix epoch,
   and it represents the beginning of time as measured by the operating
   system and most of the applications that run on it. By invoking the
   sudo command and then resetting the date, computers can be [13]tricked
   into turning over root privileges without a password.

   Developers of [14]Metasploit, an open-source software framework that
   streamlines the exploitation of vulnerabilities in a wide array of
   operating systems and applications, [15]recently added a module that
   makes it easier to exploit the sudo vulnerability on Macs. The addition
   capitalizes on the fact that all versions of OS X from 10.7 through the
   current 10.8.4 remain vulnerable. While the bug also affected many
   Linux distributions, most of those require a root password to change
   the computer clock. Macs impose no such restrictions on clock changes,
   thanks to the [16]systemsetup binary.

   Mac users should realize that an attacker must satisfy a variety of
   conditions before being able to exploit this vulnerability. For one,
   the end-user who is logged in must already have administrator
   privileges. And for another, the user must have successfully run sudo
   at least once in the past. And of course, the attacker must already
   have either physical or remote shell access to the target machine. In
   other words: this exploit can't be used in the kind of drive-by webpage
   attacks that last year [17]infected some 650,000 Macs with the
   Flashback malware. This doesn't mean it's a non-issue though, since the
   exploit can be used in concert with other attacks to magnify the damage
   they can do.

   "The bug is significant because it allows any user-level compromise to
   become root, which in turn exposes things like clear-text passwords
   from Keychain and makes it possible for the intruder to install a
   permanent rootkit," HD Moore, the founder of the Metasploit project and
   the chief research officer at security firm Rapid7, told Ars. "I
   believe Apple should take this more seriously but am not surprised with
   the slow response given their history of responding to vulnerabilities
   in the open source tools they package."

   Apple representatives didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for
   this post.

   Post updated in third-to-last paragraph to changed "invoked" to
   "successfully run."

       Is Snow Leopard 10.6.8 affected at all?
       It also uses sudo and doesn't require a password for clock changes
       by default, so I would say... yes.
       What version of sudo does 10.6.8 have? This bug only effects sudo
       1.6 and greater. You can check by running `man sudo` and it at the
       end of the pan page (bottom left corner).
       If you have 1.6 or greater, then I suggest creating a cron job that
       runs `sudo -K` every 5 minutes. This will delete the timestamp
       file... which will cause you to see the "there be dragons here"
       message every time you run sudo, but otherwise won't harm anything.

       Haha, fun party trick at the office.. Sit at a macos terminal (with
       permission, of course)
       $ systemsetup -setusingnetworktime off
       $ systemsetup -setdate 01:01:1970
       $ systemsetup -settime 10:02 // account for being in GMT+10
       timezone
       $ sudo -k
       $ sudo su
       # whoami
       root

       Nice.

       How about running
       $ sudo visudo
       to edit the sudo config, and adding the line
       Defaults timestamp_timeout=0
       You'll then be asked for a password at each sudo call, no matter
       how close to the previous successful call.
