[69]Study Shows No Clear Evidence That Google+ Drives Ranking

   At [73]SMX Advanced, I presented results from a study we had done that
   convinced me that links in shares from Google Plus and Facebook behave
   like traditional web-based links. My statements at SMX Advanced were
   later disputed by Matt Cutts during his keynote interview by Danny
   Sullivan, leading to a live discussion -- Matt even invited me up on
   stage during the keynote:

   As a result of my keynote visitation, Matt and I agreed that I would
   rerun the study, this time with some guidance from him on potential
   problems. While this input was limited in nature, it did lead to some
   ideas on how to improve the testing. As a result of that dialogue, I
   determined that there were flaws in the original study we did, and
   therefore we would need to run another one. This has proven to be a
   very difficult process, but the results are now in. So without further
   ado, let's dig in!

Study Design & Methodology

   We picked three different sites, all of which have been on the web for
   at least two years or more, and we wrote two different, relevant
   articles for each site. One of these was used as a "Test Page," and the
   other was used as a "Baseline Page." Both pages were implemented
   without any links to them from any source whatsoever. Both of them
   received an initial set of Google+ shares on July 19th, 2013. The Test
   Pages received 6 shares each, and the Baseline Pages received at least
   30 shares on that date.

   From there, the paths diverged. We provided the Baseline Page no
   further attention other than to monitor indexing and ranking behavior.
   For the Test Page, we sent additional shares in two waves, as follows:
    1. At least 25 shares on August 4th, 2013
    2. Four more shares from very authoritative profiles between August
       28th and September 1st.

   Throughout the process, we monitored ranking behavior for the pages on
   a number of different long tail search terms. The August 4th and
   late-August burst of shares are particularly important, because if
   Google+ shares are, in fact, a direct ranking factor, there should be
   noticeable changes in ranking after those shares occur. This is the
   basic premise of the entire study.

Goals & Objectives: What Makes Our Study Different

   Plain and simple, this is not a correlation study. For the record, I
   believe that correlation studies are extremely valuable -- but as we
   know, correlation is not causation, and the study results presented
   here were directly targeted at measuring causation.

   To accomplish this, we restructured the study from the one we presented
   at SMX Advanced, and set the following goals:
     * Eliminate accesses to the Test Pages and Baseline Pages by humans
       or 3rd party tools prior to discovery of the pages by Google.
     * We took a great deal of care to minimize the risk of the Test Pages
       and Baseline Pages receiving links.
     * We then checked at every major step to see if there were any links
       implemented to the site (in spite of our efforts to prevent them).
     * We used a panel of hand-picked participants to work with us on the
       study. The reason we did this was so we could have better control
       over their behavior.

   and analysis.

Possible Sources Of Error

   There are three main possible sources of error:

   1. Missing Links: It is possible that links were implemented to the
   pages that did not show up in our monitoring tools. This is not an
   insignificant potential problem, as by my estimate the cumulative links
   found by Open Site Explorer, Majestic SEO, Webmaster Tools, and Ahrefs
   is probably at best 50% of the total links to a site, and it may be as
   low as 30%.

   I base this statement on my experiences with helping sites recover from
   link penalties. At Stone Temple Consulting, we have helped more than 50
   sites recover from penalties this year, and it has happened over and
   over again that we would help these sites by cleaning out bad links,
   only to have Webmaster Tools report lots of new links the next time it
   was queried. The reported new links were not new, and I have no doubt
   that Google knew about them before but simply did not choose to include
   them in the Webmaster Tools report. However, once we cleaned out some
   of the bad ones, we got exposed to some more of the links residing in
   their database.

   2. Ranking Churn: The study was vulnerable to general ranking movement
   and algo adjustments that our Baseline Pages did not enable us to
   perceive. This is also a pretty significant risk. In fact, our results
   suggest that the scope of changes we saw were less than the general
   churn and movement of overall rankings.

   3. Other Environmental Factors: Let's face it -- what Google uses to
   rank search results involves hundreds of factors. There are lots of
   variables that could impact the results. In spite of our attempts to
   minimize people accessing the content, a small number of people chose
   to do so anyway. We nonetheless believe that the results have validity
   for reasons you will see explained below.

Detailed Results

   As mentioned, we tested articles on 3 different websites. What follows
   is a representative sample of the results from two of the sites: the
   Stone Temple Consulting site and  New England travel website.

   Stone Temple Consulting Results

   The Test Page and Baseline Page tested on this site were articles
   written by two different users about notable search engine experiences
   they had. For the Test Page, we monitored the results for 11 different
   search phrases.

   There was one search phrase that showed pretty dramatic movement. Here
   is the detail of the rankings of that phrase over time:

   stonetemple-test-single-term

   While there is significant movement, it does not occur until 24 days
   after the burst of shares on August 4th. This also happens to be just a
   few days after a lot of SEO community chatter occurred about a possible
   Google update (the chatter began on August 21st).

   The behavior of the Baseline Pages is also pretty interesting to
   examine:

   stonetemple-baseline-low-ranking-terms

   stonetemple-baseline-high-ranking-terms

   The movement of rankings on the Baseline Page occurs on the 29th of
   August, one day after the movement on the Test Page, and it moves in
   the opposite direction -- the rankings get worse.

   Travel New England Results

   The Test Page and Baseline Page tested on this site were articles
   written by two different users about notable experiences they had
   traveling in New England. For the Test Page, we monitored the results
   for 10 different search phrases.

   For this site, there was no material movement at all during the entire
   test:

   tne-test-many-terms

   For completeness, this is what we saw on the Baseline Pages:

   tne-baseline-low-ranking-terms

   tne-baseline-high-ranking-terms

   No major movement was seen at any time during the monitoring of the
   results for the test on this site. The Baseline Pages actually show
   more movement around August 31st than the Test Page terms do at any
   time.

Analysis

   Our study had 3 major goals: to see if Google Plus would drive
   discovery, indexing, and ranking. So, I will comment on that in three
   independent sections as follows.

   Discovery

   In my opinion, it is highly likely that Google Plus drove discovery of
   the content. Here is a sequence of accesses to one piece on the Test
   Pages extracted from the log file on one of the sites:

   Log File Sequence

   The line items that refer to
   "+https://developers.google.com/+/web/snippet/" are Google Plus sharing
   events taking place to the content in question. And, of course,
   +http://www.google.com/bot.html is GoogleBot. Notice how it takes less
   than 6 minutes for GoogleBot to come to the page after the first share
   of the page, and there is a visit by GoogleBot to the site for each
   share. There are no other accesses of any kind to the content in this
   time period.

   In addition, note that the Google Developers page for [75]implementing
   +1 buttons states the following:

     By using a Google+ button, Publishers give Google permission to
     utilize an automated software program, often called a "web crawler,"
     to retrieve and analyze websites associated with a Google+ button.

   Indexing

   Initial shares of all six articles occurred on July 19th. All of the
   articles initially appeared in the index on July 29th -- 10 days later.

   After a detailed review of data from Google Webmaster Tools, Majestic
   SEO, Open Site Explorer and Ahrefs, we found no links to any of the
   three pages using the available tools as outlined above. This does not
   mean that the content received no links, only that the available tools
   did not have those links, and this is a possible source of error.

   One other point of discussion is that the long delay between the shares
   and the initial indexing does raise some concerns. Clearly, this G+
   share data was not leveraged in real-time. Why did it take 10 days?

   But, in summary, with the information available to me, I don't see any
   other signals that would have caused the posts to be indexed.

   Ranking

   Once we saw that a page was indexed, we were immediately able to find
   search queries for which the page ranked. However, this does not mean
   that the shares were driving ranking. As per the original Sergey
   Brin/Larry Page thesis, each page on the web has a small amount of
   innate PageRank. This PageRank by itself might cause an ability to rank
   for certain types of long tail queries, even in the absence of any
   other signals.

   In addition, a page with no links may also gain some benefit from the
   overall authority of the domain on which it resides. How this works
   exactly is not known outside of Google. However, it is clear that we
   need more data to be able to conclude that we would see potential
   ranking benefits from G+ shares. This is the reason we sent two
   additional waves of shares in the direction of the pages being tested.

   To me, the most remarkable thing about the data in this part of the
   test is how unremarkable it is. Based on this data, my interpretation
   is that this study did not show material evidence of Google Plus shares
   driving rankings movement for the Test Pages. Read more on my thoughts
   on this in the summary below.

Analysis Summary & Commentary

   Here is how I would sum it up:
    1. Google+ shares do drive discovery.
    2. Google+ shares appear to drive indexing, but there is some
       possibility of error if the pages received links we are not aware
       of.
    3. We saw no material evidence of Google+ shares driving ranking.

   Our test was designed to eliminate distracting signals, and hence we
   did something that, in its own way, was a bit unnatural: we attempted
   to minimize (and, in fact, eliminate) reshares. The text description
   used in the shares of the articles was not normal -- it was a warning
   to others to not look at the content. We needed to do that to try and
   get as pure a measurement as possible. These constraints could possibly
   impact the validity of the findings.

   (Note: Behaviors such as organic reshares, comments, and other social
   activity could help improve rankings, but ordinary Web links do not
   depend on comments and reshares to carry weight.)

   My opinion is that if there is any impact from links in Google Plus
   shares, that they do not get treated the same way a regular link does,
   even though we can see that links in Google Plus pass PageRank. Google
   can filter link signals, including those in Google+, at many levels.
   Why would they allow shared links to pass PageRank if they did not want
   to use that PageRank in some manner? Perhaps they want to use it to
   help them identify more authoritative profiles. There are already many
   who believe that the posts of more authoritative Google Plus profiles
   get indexed by Google faster and are shown in their followers' Google
   results more often.

   I acknowledge that there are many ways to point at the holes in this
   study, and I have offered my interpretation of it. Let the debate
   begin. What do you think?

       Excellent study regarding Google+ shares - I would however, suggest
       that the title of the article be tweaked, as this isn't a study
       about whether Google+ affects ranking; rather, it's a study as to
       whether Google+ *shares* affects ranking. Another question -
       wouldn't the structure of the articles written (keywords, meta
       data, etc) also have an impact in the ranking? Are the articles
       similar or identical in keywords and meta data? It's so hard to
       complete these types of studies because of the variables. Very
       insightful article - thanks for sharing!

       It's always interesting to see theories put forward, dismissed,
       debunked, un-bunked, mythologised...
       I'd be interested to understand a bit more as to how you tracked
       the ranking data, though. I'm guessing you were working with
       "vanilla results".
       The reason I ask is that Distilled presented data last year
       suggesting that the way +1s increase rankings is really very much
       in the event of a very personalised search - they gave the example
       of someone +1ing a brand's Google+ page and that directly
       (positively) affecting the search results of friends of the
       original user when they subsequently used a relevant keyword.

       Shame really, because at least if it did have an effect on ranking
       it'd be worth using and have some kind of reason to exist...
     * http://www.koozai.com/author/ali-moghadam/ Ali Moghadam
       I think you're onto something there Matt. Personalisation, +1s,
       Your Google+ network - it's all got to be intertwined. I think
       Google's looking for a more `human approved' algorithm, weaving in
       Google+ as a form of user supported recommendation. We've already
       got things like the Disavow Tool, inviting webmasters to provide
       lists of human checked bad links. Human curators will shape future
       updates I reckon, there's only so much they can do before they
       crack AI!

       There clearly are specific circumstances where Google+ clearly does
       impact rankings, particularly, as set out above, where people in
       your circles (or extended circles) have interacted with a piece of
       content.
       And if you're a brand, you effectively get to pick which piece of
       fresh or deep content you want to rank alongside your homepage,
       because of the latest G+ post showing up in the sidebar.
       So I think to say it has *no* reason to exist is going a bit far,
       and it certainly is worth using for many sites, particularly those
       that are recognised brands.

       Well we all know you can write the best content in the world on
       your site, but if it is not shared, linked to or discovered at all
       then it wont rank. That is correlation to me to cause it to rank.

       Great stuff, Eric. It is hard to generalize about any finding as it
       may have more weight in some contexts than others. I also have
       questions about whether rank checks mean anything given the degree
       of localization/personalization. All that said, this is a very cool
       study. Thanks for sharing.

       Hi Joe - you are right in that it is more about Google+ Shares, and
       in addition, it is about Google+ shares in a vaccuum - without
       other signals.
       The articles were posted on 3 different sites, and were topically
       relevant to each site, so not related to each other.
     * Eric Enge
       Matt - totally agree that personalized search still applies.
       Google+ will definitely impact that. We were trying to measure the
       impact on "non-personalized" search in this study.
     * Eric Enge
       Michael M - completely agree!
     * Eric Enge
       David - totally agree that it has a reason to exist, and I do say
       that above, and in my extended article on the stonetemple.com web
       site. The conclusion is not that there is no impact, but that it is
       not the same impact as traditional web links, AND the benefits of
       personalized results still applies!
     * Eric Enge
       you are welcome, glad you liked it!

       I think Google +1 has an indirect effect on ranking just not
       direct. Matt Cuttz chose his words carefully when he recently said
       it doesn't have a `direct' effect rather than saying it doesn't
       have an effect at all. For him use those words, there'd have to be
       a logical reason why he didn't simply say it has no effect period.
       It can easily be one of the multiple factors that play a role in
       contributing towards a natural link profile which has a direct
       effect on ranking, and Matt Cuttz alluded to this in the past when
       he said a site or page that gets bookmarked or shared is more
       likely to get natural backlinks. If a website has a lot of
       backlinks pointing towards it but no social media votes, it raises
       a red flag regarding the nature of the backlinks. Especially when
       it's a lot easier to for random visitors to give a social media
       vote(Facebook like, Google +1, Tweet etc...) than it is for them to
       backlink to a site because they naturally like it. Not everyone
       owns a website to have the option of giving backlinks. But a lot
       more people exist who have social media accounts and can give
       votes.

       I agree: the title needs to be changed because it's actually the
       number of G+ shares the study is focused on and not Google+
       generally as a social media platform.
       Great article nevertheless, Eric. Thanks for writing this for the
       community.
     * Igal Stolpner
       First of all thanks for the study!
       Besides the fact that personalized search still applies with
       Google+, I honestly think that the results for non-personalized
       search might just change in the future.
       From my personal studies I got the same results but we still do
       care about Google+ both because of the personalized results (and
       they are extremely important these days) and as a long term
       investment.
     * L. van Eembergen
       Great article Eric, really great setup of your study. You are
       saying in your analysis summary; Google + drives no ranking.
       But I'm wondering, if the Baseline page were declining because the
       starting boost every page receives due to all factors was wearing
       off and the Testpages were gaining `authority' due to receiving
       Google + shares instead of also declining.
       Looking forward to your discussion in the hangout.
     * http://www.addthree.com/ Miles Rossow
       Dave's point is that there is no visibility on G+ because nobody
       uses it. I use the term "nobody" loosely.
     * Michael Cottam
       Great job on this, Eric! FYI I shared it on Google+, but....don't
       expect that to help this article to rank :-p
     * Marc_Razia
       I will never understand this over used cliche about no one using
       G+. Its obviously not in Facebook's league by any measure, but when
       I am on there I see plenty of communities with well over 100,000
       members. There are also hundreds of celebrities each with well over
       a million people following them. I'm able to find new public posts
       daily on just about any topic. If fact anyone could verify these
       things if they bothered to actually look.
       That's surely not everybody, not even close, but its definitely not
       "nobody".
     * Eric Enge
       Marc - you are absolutely correct. G+ is a very active social
       network, across many different spaces.
     * Eric Enge
       AdmiralLuke - while we can't confirm your speculation above, I
       think there is a good chance that you are correct!
     * http://www.dbsit.com.au/ Danny
       amazing analysis and study reports related to Google Plus and
       personalized search. :-)
     * Patrick Minard
       I agree with the whole concept that social metrics should influence
       where a page belongs in relation to another within search engine
       rankings. What frustrates me is that Google are trying to
       artificially create a social network by forcing people to share on
       via Google+. I would like to think that any shares via Facebook /
       Twitter would carry the same social weighting into the ranking
       value but I somewhat feel that more shares via Google's own service
       will have a better effect.
     * eye9 Design
       I am with AdmiralLuke on this one. I think it is fairly naive to
       think that the king of search doesn't use their own Social
       Networking environment to affect results. Google +1 has plenty of
       users and you can certainly see how Google could, and in my opinion
       does, use their own social media network to find out what sites are
       worthy of higher rankings. Furthermore, I suspect they will turn up
       the "value" of Google +1 in the future as they learn more about how
       it is used relative to search results.
     * http://www.carsmaniacs.com/ Silviu Fera
       yeah right and the Moon is not round..
     * Tom
       Interesting comment Admiral Luke and I think you're right. I've had
       sites/posts naturally get to the top of search rankings without any
       backlinking and I suspect that it was mainly through Stumbleupon
       likes. If other social media is influencing SERPs I can't believe
       that Google+ does nothing more than kickstart the indexing and I
       think it will only gain in importance.
