   European Commission - Press release

   Digital Agenda: Turning government data into gold

   Brussels, 12 December 2011 - The Commission has launched an Open Data
   Strategy for Europe, which is expected to deliver a EUR40 billion boost
   to the EU's economy each year. Europe's public administrations are
   sitting on a goldmine of unrealised economic potential: the large
   volumes of information collected by numerous public authorities and
   services. Member States such as the [38]United Kingdom and [39]France
   are already demonstrating this value. The strategy to lift performance
   EU-wide is three-fold: firstly the Commission will lead by example,
   opening its vaults of information to the public for free through a new
   data portal. Secondly, a level playing field for open data across the
   EU will be established. Finally, these new measures are backed by the
   EUR100 million which will be granted in 2011-2013 to fund research into
   improved data-handling technologies.

   These actions position the EU as the global leader in the re-use of
   public sector information. They will boost the thriving industry that
   turns raw data into the material that hundreds of millions of ICT users
   depend on, for example smart phone apps, such as maps, real-time
   traffic and weather information, price comparison tools and more. Other
   leading beneficiaries will include journalists and academics.

   Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said: "We are sending a strong
   signal to administrations today. Your data is worth more if you give it
   away. So start releasing it now: use this framework to join the other
   smart leaders who are already gaining from embracing open data.
   Taxpayers have already paid for this information, the least we can do
   is give it back to those who want to use it in new ways that help
   people and create jobs and growth." [40]See Mrs Kroes video quote here.

   The Commission proposes to update the 2003 Directive on the re-use of
   public sector information by:
     * Making it a general rule that all documents made accessible by
       public sector bodies can be re-used for any purpose, commercial or
       non-commercial, unless protected by third party copyright;
     * Establishing the principle that public bodies should not be allowed
       to charge more than costs triggered by the individual request for
       data (marginal costs); in practice this means most data will be
       offered for free or virtually for free, unless duly justified.
     * Making it compulsory to provide data in commonly-used,
       machine-readable formats, to ensure data can be effectively
       re-used.
     * Introducing regulatory oversight to enforce these principles;
     * Massively expanding the reach of the Directive to include
       libraries, museums and archives for the first time; the existing
       2003 rules will apply to data from such institutions.

   In addition, the Commission will make its own data public through a new
   "data portal", for which the Commission has already agreed the
   contract. This portal is currently in `beta version' (development and
   testing phase) with an expected launch in spring 2012. In time this
   will serve as a single-access point for re-usable data from all EU
   institutions, bodies and agencies and national authorities.

   Background

   Open Data is general information that can be freely used, re-used and
   redistributed by anyone - either free or at marginal cost.

   The Commission's proposal today would operate in full respect of rules
   on the treatment of personal data.

   Studies conducted on behalf of the European Commission show that
   industry and citizens still face difficulties in finding and re-using
   public sector information. That is to say, open data is largely
   undeveloped in Europe.

   In the important sector of geographical information, almost 80% of the
   respondents to Commission surveys say that they are prevented from
   making full use of information held by public bodies. Reasons include
   high fees, non-transparent rules and practices regarding re-use, a lack
   of transparency on what type of data is held and by whom, and exclusive
   licensing agreements which may have the effect of undermining
   competition.

   In its [41]'Digital Agenda for Europe' the Commission identified the
   re-use of public sector information, alongside fast and ultra fast
   internet access, as key to delivering a Digital Single Market.

   [42]Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information
   introduced a first set of measures to make it easier for businesses to
   obtain access and permission to re-use government-held information. It
   also brought about a process whereby governmental agencies lowered the
   fees charged for obtaining the information. Today's proposal extends
   access and widens the coverage of the Directive.
