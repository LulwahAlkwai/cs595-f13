Military Report: America Has 'Misguided' Fixation With Domestic Drilling

The report, released quietly this month, says climate change is a bigger
national security threat than the country's dependence on foreign oil.

   [55]By John H. Cushman Jr., InsideClimate News
   Jun 24, 2013
   Marines build a solar panel.

   WASHINGTON--A [56]new report from the [57]U.S. Center for Naval
   Analyses and the London-based [58]Royal United Services Institute, two
   of the NATO alliance's front-line strategy centers, recommends putting
   more effort into fighting global warming than securing reliable
   supplies of fossil fuels.

   The authors call the habitual American fixation on winning energy
   independence through expanded North American production of oil and
   natural gas "misguided." They say the "only sustainable solution" to
   the problem of energy insecurity is not through more drilling, but
   through energy efficiency and renewable fuels, like biofuels to replace
   oil.

   Despite the steady supplies provided by the current U.S. drilling boom,
   "the increased domestic production of oil and natural gas is not a
   panacea for the country's energy security dilemma," they say.

   And in blunt language, they criticize American policymakers and
   legislators for refusing to accept the "robust" scientific evidence
   that emissions of carbon dioxide are already causing harmful global
   warming, and for refusing to take actions that, if taken swiftly, could
   ward off its worst effects.

   "Political leaders, including many in the United States, refuse to
   accept short-term costs to address long-term dangers even though the
   future costs of responding to disasters after they occur will be far
   greater," said their report, published this month.

   The report, in the works for a year, was released as President Obama
   prepared to ramp up the administration's efforts on climate change, and
   while the State Department was [59]immersed in its review of whether to
   approve the Keystone XL pipeline to carry tar sands oil from Canada to
   refineries in the United States.

   In a major policy speech on Tuesday, Obama is expected to renew his
   commitment to regulating emissions from coal-fired power plants, as
   well as other measures involving renewable energy and green
   technologies, but not to tip his hand on the Keystone decision. Many in
   Washington believe that he wants to offer strict controls on power
   plants, the nation's leading source of greenhouse gases, as a quid pro
   quo for approving the controversial pipeline, which is seen by
   opponents as a contributor to the global warming problem.

   Keystone's proponents have described the project as important for
   energy security.

   For several years, the view that global warming caused by burning
   fossil fuels is an overwhelming national security threat has been
   taking firmer hold in national security circles. In 2007, a [60]report
   from CNA's military advisory board called climate change a "threat
   multiplier." In 2008, a formal National Intelligence Assessment found
   that climate change poses a serious threat to national security and
   long-term global stability. [61]The Department of Defense's 2010
   Quadrennial Defense Review, a major planning document, warned that
   climate change may fuel conflict, put new strains on military forces
   operating in the field, and cause damage to military bases, especially
   ports exposed to rising seas and intense storms.

   In an article published in [62]Foreign Affairs online in June, Tom
   Donilon, the former National Security Adviser to President Obama,
   wrote: "The Obama administration's National Security Strategy
   recognizes the 'real, urgent, and severe' threat posed by climate
   change in no uncertain terms, stating, 'change wrought by a warming
   planet will lead to new conflicts over refugees and resources; new
   suffering from drought and famine; catastrophic natural disasters; and
   the degradation of land across the globe.'"

   But the focus of Donilon's piece was on energy, not on climate change,
   and it spoke expansively of the importance of increased energy
   production to America's strength in the world. For example, it claimed
   that by helping to provide plentiful oil to satisfy world demand, the
   United States could more effectively squeeze Iran with an embargo, a
   strategy that otherwise would harm oil-deficient allies.

   The new American-British report looks mostly at the other side of the
   coin, the risks presented by the burning of fossil fuels no matter
   where they come from.

   It acknowledges the problems caused by Western reliance on imported
   oil, especially from unstable parts of the world. But the new report
   says that even more important is the compelling need to stop using
   fossil fuels in the first place, since the steady addition of carbon
   dioxide to the atmosphere is now posing imminent dangers to national
   security.

   Even though the United States gets just 20 percent of its oil imports
   from the Middle East, the lowest share in four decades--and it could be
   headed toward being an oil exporter two decades from now--"the U.S.
   economy is highly sensitive to supply shocks and price fluctuations,
   regardless of the source of the oil," it says. "Even new, domestic
   sources of oil and gas do not free the United States from the risks of
   over-reliance, because the prices of these commodities will be
   determined by global markets," the report says.
