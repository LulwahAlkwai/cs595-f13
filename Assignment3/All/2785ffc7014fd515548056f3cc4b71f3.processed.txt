Objection to Microdata Candidate Recommendation

   By [7]ManuSporny On November 25, 2012 In [8]RDFa, [9]Semantic Web,
   [10]Standards With [11]16 Comments Permanent Link to Objection to
   Microdata Candidate Recommendation [12]Permalink

   Full disclosure: I'm the current chair of the standards group at the
   World Wide Web Consortium that created the newest version of RDFa,
   editor of the HTML5+RDFa 1.1 and RDFa Lite 1.1 specifications, and I'm
   also a member of the HTML Working Group.

   Edit: 2012-12-01 - Updated the article to rephrase some things, and
   include rationale and counter-arguments at the bottom in preparation
   for the HTML WG poll on the matter.

   The HTML Working Group at the W3C is currently trying to decide if they
   should transition the Microdata specification to the next stage in the
   standardization process. There has been a [13]call for consensus to
   transition the spec to the Candidate Recommendation stage. The problem
   is that we already have a set of specifications that are official W3C
   recommendations that do what Microdata does and more. RDFa 1.1 became
   an official W3C Recommendation last summer. From a standards
   perspective, this is a mistake and sends a confused signal to Web
   developers. Officially supporting two specification that do almost
   exactly the same thing in almost exactly the same way is, ultimately, a
   failure to standardize.

   The fact that RDFa already does what Microdata does has been elaborated
   upon before:

   [14]Mythical Differences: RDFa Lite vs. Microdata
   [15]An Uber-comparison of RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats

   Here's the problem in a nutshell: The W3C is thinking of ratifying two
   completely different specifications that [16]accomplish the same thing
   in basically the same way. The functionality of RDFa, which is already
   a W3C Recommendation, overlaps Microdata by a large margin. In fact,
   RDFa Lite 1.1 was developed as a plug-in replacement for Microdata. The
   full version of RDFa can also do a number of things that Microdata
   cannot, such as datatyping, associating more than one type per object,
   embed-ability in languages other than HTML, ability to easily publish
   and mix vocabularies, etc.

   Microdata would have easily been dead in the water had it not been for
   two simple facts: 1) The editor of the specification works at Google,
   and 2) Google pushed Microdata as the markup language for schema.org
   before also accepting RDFa markup. The first enabled Google and the
   editor to work on schema.org without signalling to the public that it
   was creating a competitor to Facebook's Open Graph Protocol. The second
   gave Microdata enough of a jump start to establish a foothold for
   schema.org markup. There have been a number of studies that [17]show
   that Microdata's sole use case (99% of Microdata markup) is for the
   markup of schema.org terms. Microdata is not widely used outside of
   that context, we now have data to back up what we had predicted would
   happen when schema.org made their initial announcement for
   Microdata-only support. Note that schema.org now supports both RDFa and
   Microdata.

   It is typically a bad idea to have two formats published by the same
   organization that do the same thing. It leads to Web developer
   confusion surrounding which format to use. One of the goals of Web
   standards is to reduce, or preferably eliminate, the confusion
   surrounding the correct technology decision to make. The HTML Working
   Group and the W3C is failing miserably on this front. There is more
   confusion today about picking Microdata or RDFa because they accomplish
   the same thing in effectively the same way. The only reason both exist
   is due to political reasons.

   If we step back and look at the technical arguments, there is no
   compelling reason that Microdata should be a W3C Recommendation. There
   is no compelling reason to have two specifications that do the same
   thing in basically the same way. Therefore, as a member of the HTML
   Working Group (not as a chair or editor of RDFa) I object to the
   publication of Microdata as a Candidate Recommendation.

   Note that this is not a W3C formal objection. This is an informal
   objection to publish Microdata along the Recommendation track. This
   objection will not become an official W3C formal objection if the HTML
   Working Group holds a poll to gather consensus around whether Microdata
   should proceed along the Recommendation publication track. I believe
   the publication of a W3C Note will continue to allow Google to support
   Microdata in schema.org, but will hopefully correct the confused
   message that the W3C has been sending to Web developers regarding RDFa
   and Microdata. We don't need two specifications that do almost exactly
   the same thing.

   The message sent by the W3C needs to be very clear: There is one
   recommendation for doing structured data markup in HTML. That
   recommendation is RDFa. It addresses all of the use cases that have
   been put forth by the general Web community, and it's ready for broad
   adoption and implementation today.

   If you agree with this blog post, make sure to [18]let the HTML Working
   Group know that you do not think that the W3C should ratify two
   specifications that do almost exactly the same thing in almost exactly
   the same way. Now is the time to speak up!

Summary of Facts and Arguments

   Below is a summary of arguments presented as a basis for publishing
   Microdata along the W3C Note track:
    1. RDFa 1.1 is already a [19]ratified Web standard as of June 7th 2012
       and absorbed almost every Microdata feature before it became
       official. If the majority of the differences between RDFa and
       Microdata boil down to different attribute names (property vs.
       itemprop), then the two solutions have effectively converged on
       syntax and W3C should not ratify two solutions that do effectively
       the same thing in almost exactly the same way.
    2. RDFa is [20]supported by all of the major search crawlers,
       including Google (and schema.org), Microsoft, Yahoo!, Yandex, and
       Facebook. Microdata is not supported by Facebook.
    3. RDFa Lite 1.1 is [21]feature-equivalent to Microdata. Over 99% of
       Microdata markup can be expressed easily in RDFa Lite 1.1.
       Converting from Microdata to RDFa Lite is as simple as a search and
       replace of the Microdata attributes with RDFa Lite attributes.
       Conversely, Microdata does not support a number of the more
       advanced RDFa features, like being able to tell the difference
       between feet and meters.
    4. You can [22]mix vocabularies with RDFa Lite 1.1, supporting both
       schema.org and Facebook's Open Graph Protocol (OGP) using a single
       markup language. You don't have to learn Microdata for schema.org
       and RDFa for Facebook - just use RDFa for both.
    5. The [23]creator of the Microdata specification doesn't like
       Microdata. When people are not passionate about the solutions that
       they create, the desire to work on those solutions and continue
       improve upon them is muted. The RDFa community is passionate about
       the technology that they have created together and have strived to
       make it better since the standardization of RDFa 1.0 back in 2008.
    6. RDFa Lite 1.1 is [24]fully upward-compatible with RDFa 1.1,
       allowing you to seamlessly migrate to a more feature-rich language
       as your Linked Data needs grow. Microdata does not support any of
       the more advanced features provided by RDFa 1.1.
    7. RDFa [25]deployment is broader than Microdata. RDFa deployment
       continues to grow at a rapid pace.
    8. The economic damage generated by publishing both RDFa and Microdata
       along the Recommendation track should not be underestimated. W3C
       should try to provide clear direction in an attempt to reduce the
       economic waste that a "let the market sort it out among two nearly
       identical solutions" strategy will generate. At some point, the
       market will figure out that both solutions are nearly identical,
       but only after publishing and building massive amounts of content
       and tooling for both.
    9. The W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG), which is responsible
       for ensuring that the core architecture of the Web is sound, has
       [26]raised their concern about the publication of both Microdata
       and RDFa as recommendations. After the W3C TAG raised their
       concerns, the RDFa Working Group created RDFa Lite 1.1 to be a near
       feature-equivalent replacement for Microdata that was also
       backwards-compatible with RDFa 1.0.
   10. Publishing a standard that does almost exactly the same thing as an
       existing standard in almost exactly the same way is a [27]failure
       to standardize.

Counter-arguments and Rebuttals

     [This is a] [28]classic case of monopolistic anti-competitive
     protectionism.

   No, this is an objection to publishing two specifications that do
   almost exactly the same thing in almost exactly the same way along the
   W3C Recommendation publication track. Protectionism would have asked
   that all work on Microdata be stopped and the work scuttled. The
   proposed resolution does not block anybody from using Microdata, nor
   does it try to stop or block the Microdata work from happening in the
   HTML WG. The objection asks that the W3C decide what the best path
   forward for Web developers is based on a fairly complicated set of
   predicted outcomes. This is not an easy decision. The objection is
   intended to ensure that the HTML Working Group has this discussion
   before we proceed to Candidate Recommendation with Microdata.

<manu1> I'd like the W3C to work as well, and I think publishing two specs that
accomplish basically
        the same thing in basically the same way shows breakage.
<annevk> Bit late for that. XDM vs DOM, XPath vs Selectors, XSL-FO vs CSS, XSLT
vs XQuery,
         XQuery vs XQueryX, RDF/XML vs Turtle, XForms vs Web Forms 2.0,
         XHTML 1.0 vs HTML 4.01, XML 1.0 4th Edition vs XML 1.0 5th Edition,
         XML 1.0 vs XML 1.1, etc.

     [[29]link to full conversation]

   While W3C does have a history of publishing competing specifications,
   there have been features in each competing specification that were
   compelling enough to warrant the publication of both standards. For
   example, XHTML 1.0 provided a standard set of rules for validating
   documents that was aligned with XML and a decentralized extension
   mechanism that HTML4.01 did not. Those two major features were viewed
   as compelling enough to publish both specifications as Recommendations
   via W3C.

   For authors, the differences between RDFa and Microdata are so small
   that, for 99% of documents in the wild, you can convert a Microdata
   document to an RDFa Lite 1.1 document with a simple search and replace
   of attribute names. That demonstrates that the syntaxes for both
   languages are different only in the names of the HTML attributes, and
   that does not seem like a very compelling reason to publish both
   specifications as Recommendations.

     [30]Microdata's processing algorithm is vastly simpler, which makes
     the data
     extracted more reliable and, when something does go wrong, makes it
     easier for 1) users to debug their own data, and 2) easier for me to
     debug it if they can't figure it out on their own.

   Microdata's processing algorithm is simpler for two major reasons:
     * [31]Microdata does not support as many features and use cases as
       RDFa does.
     * RDFa 1.1 is backwards-compatible with RDFa 1.0, which complicates
       the processing rules. The same is true for HTML5.

   The complexity of implementing a processor has little bearing on how
   easy it is for developers to author documents. For example, XHTML 1.0
   had a simpler processing model which made the data that was extracted
   more reliable and when something went wrong, it was easier to debug.
   However, HTML5 supported more use cases and recovers from errors in
   cases where it can, which made it more popular with Web developers in
   the long-run.

   Additionally, authors of Microdata and RDFa [32]should be using tools
   like RDFa Play to debug their markup. This is true for any Web
   technology. We debug our HTML, JavaScript, and CSS by loading it into a
   browser and bringing up the debugging tools. This is no different for
   Microdata and RDFa. If you want to make sure your markup does what you
   want, make sure to verify it by using a tool and not by trying to
   memorize the processing rules and running them through your head.

     For what it is worth, I personally think [33]RDFa is generally a
     technically better solution. But as Marcos says, "so what"? Our job
     at W3C is to make standards for the technology the market decides to
     use.

   If we think one of these technologies is a technically better solution
   than the other one, we should signal that realization at some level.
   The most basic thing we could do is to make one an official
   Recommendation, and the other a Note. I also agree that our job at W3C
   is to make standards that the technology market decides to use, but
   clearly this particular case isn't that cut-and-dried. Schema.org's
   only option in the beginning was to use Microdata, and since authors
   didn't want to risk not showing up in the search engines, they used
   Microdata. This forced the market to go in one direction.

   This discussion would be in a different place had Google kept the
   playing field level. That is not to say that Google didn't have good
   reasons for making the decisions that they did at the time, but those
   reasons influenced the development of RDFa, and RDFa Lite 1.1 was the
   result. The differences between Microdata and RDFa have been removed
   and a new question is in front of us: given two almost identical
   technologies, should the W3C publish two specifications that do almost
   exactly the same thing in almost exactly the same way?

     ... the [HTML] Working Group explicitly [34]decided not to pick a
     winner between HTML Microdata and HTML+RDFa

   The question before the HTML WG at the time was whether or not to split
   Microdata out of the HTML5 specification. The HTML Working Group did
   not discuss whether the publishing track for the Microdata document
   should be the W3C Note track or the W3C Recommendation track. At the
   time the decision was made, RDFa Lite 1.1 did not exist, RDFa Lite 1.1
   was not a W3C Recommendation, nor did the RDFa and Microdata
   functionality so greatly overlap as they do now. Additionally, the HTML
   WG decision at that time states the following under the "Revisiting the
   issue" section:

   "If Microdata and RDFa converge in syntax..."

   Microdata and RDFa have effectively converged in syntax. Since
   Microdata can be interpreted as RDFa based on a simple
   search-and-replace of attributes that the languages have effectively
   converged on syntax except for the attribute names. The proposal is not
   to have work on Microdata stopped. Let work on Microdata proceed in
   this group, but let it proceed on the W3C Note publication track.

Closing Statements

   I felt uneasy raising this issue because it's a touchy and painful
   subject for everyone involved. Even if the discussion is painful, it is
   a healthy one for a standardization body to have from time to time.
   What I wanted was for the HTML Working Group to have this discussion.
   If the upcoming poll finds that the consensus of the HTML Working Group
   is to continue with the Microdata specification along the
   Recommendation track, I will not pursue a W3C Formal Objection. I will
   respect whatever decision the HTML Working Group makes as I trust the
   Chairs of that group, the process that they've put in place, and the
   aggregate opinion of the members in that group. After all, that is how
   the standardization process is supposed to work and I'm thankful to be
   a part of it.

       I think that web developers are already confused.
       As far as I've understood there is a good reason for using
       Microdata over RDF because the latter is incompatible with HTML.
       If RDF can be made compatible with HTML, as I see there are some
       efforts in the works, I'd expect a hard fight trying to convince
       the developer community after the wholesale shift away from XHTML
       and its stylings.

            RDF is a data model. RDFa is a syntax for using RDF in XML,
            XHTML, HTML-based languages. RDFa (and thus RDF) is perfectly
            compatible with HTML4, XHTML1, HTML5, XHTML5, SVG, Docbook,
            XML, etc.

       Not having to litter markup with itemscope(?) should be enough of a

       Bottom line is consistency.
       How can we depend on anything in the W3C if it allows a drastic
       change of state whenever one member organization demands it?
       Metadata annotation is for the long term. Because it's for the long
       term, we need a specification that we know is going to be around
       for the long term. There has been, consistently, a strong core of
       people behind RDF, and then eventually RDFa and now RDFa Lite that
       demonstrates a level of consistent support. Microdata was a one-man
       spec developed in a weekend in a fit of spite. But that one man
       works for a powerful tech company, and that seems to be enough.
       More importantly, if the W3C allows Microdata, does this mean we'll
       end up with a third such spec in the future whenever some other
       powerful company demands it? A fourth?
       If people have problems with RDF/RDFa/RDFa Lite, work with the
       group to fix them. Don't just have kittens and create your own
       spec.

            ignoring RDFa, nor is it ignorance. There might be a bit of
            NIH going on, but typically when things are this
            controversial, W3C shies away from picking something and
            instead pushes two options in an effort to get the market to
            decide what the final standard should be. The down-side is the
            economic waste of folks having to rewrite their systems when
            the final standard emerges. The whole point of standardization
            is to standardize on /something/... not two things that do
            almost exactly the same thing. We'll see what the final

       @shelly hit the nail right on the head.
       RDFa is indeed a far superior technology than Microdata. The
       primary reason is because of its vocabulary extensibility. As with
       XHTML 1.1, the problem was never in the specification, but in the
       implementation.
       By implementing Microdata over RDFa, schema.org made a LOUD
       statement about RDFa to the developer community; a community
       heavily reliant on SEO (for whatever reason). By leveraging its
       position in the search market, schema.org basically told everyone
       that Microdata is the better technology.
       Is this true? No, but it doesn't matter. XHTML 1.1 is better than
       HTML 5, but XHTML 1.1 was never implemented fully by the browser
       vendors thus making the specification appear flawed. So a rebel
       group created HTML 5, which is like a glass container as compared
       to XHTML 1.1.
       RDFa should have been positioned to create another slice in the
       separation principle for web authoring: the separation of semantics
       from content. With the Role attribute for adding semantics to
       structural elements, the age of truly professional web authoring
       was just over the horizon.
       Instead, one member faction of the W3C grabs its basketball and
       goes home to the WHATWG and another member faction grabs the rim
       and goes home to schema.org. The problem is not in objecting to the
       movement of the Microdata specification, but cowering to the
       usurpers within the consortium.

       Over the semantic Web popularized by TBL TED Talk of Linked Data,

       In this post, you take a quote from an email I wrote, "Microdata's
       processing algorithm is vastly simpler..." You respond by saying:
       "The complexity of implementing a processor has little bearing on
       how easy it is for developers to author documents... Additionally,
       authors of Microdata and RDFa should be using tools like RDFa Play
       to debug their markup."
       As I pointed out in that same email (in a part which you didn't
       include), the RDFa 1.1 parsing tools give different results with a
       relatively high frequency. For example, you state that authors
       should use RDFa Play to test their data. However, RDFa Play doesn't
       work for pages that Drupal outputs, as pointed out in an issue 8
       months ago [1].
       This means that users will get vastly different results if they try
       the same page in RDFa Play vs the W3C Distiller. You can try this
       with an example [2]. What is a content author supposed to do with
