   We may never have our flying cars, but the future is here. From
   creating fully functioning artificial leaves to hacking the human
   brain, science made a lot of breakthroughs this year.

1. Quadriplegic Uses Her Mind to Control Her Robotic Arm

   At the University of Pittsburgh, the neurobiology department worked
   with 52-year-old Jan Scheuermann over the course of 13 weeks to create
   a robotic arm controlled only by the power of Scheuermann's mind.
   The team implanted her with two 96-channel intracortical
   microelectrodes. Placed in the motor cortex, which controls all limb
   movement, the integration process was faster than anyone expected. On
   the second day, Jan could use her new arm with a 3-D workspace. By the
   end of the 13 weeks, she was capable of performing complex tasks with
   seven-dimensional movement, just like a biological arm.
   To date, there have been no negative side effects.

2. DARPA Robot Can Traverse an Obstacle Course

   Once the robot figures out how to do that without all the wires,
   humanity is doomed.
   DARPA was also hard at work this year making robots to track humans and
   run as fast as a cheetah, which seems like a great combination with no
   possibility of horrible side effects.

3. Genetically Modified Silk Is Stronger Than Steel

   At the University of Wyoming, scientists modified a group of silkworms
   to produce silk that is, weight for weight, stronger than steel.
   Different groups hope to benefit from the super-strength silk,
   including stronger sutures for the medical community, a biodegradable
   alternative to plastics, and even lightweight armor for military
   purposes.

4. DNA Was Photographed for the First Time

   Using an electron microscope, Enzo di Fabrizio and his team at the
   Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa snapped the first photos of
   the famous double helix.

5. Invisibility Cloak Technology Took a Huge Leap Forward

   British Columbia company HyperStealth Biotechnology showed a
   functioning prototype of its new fabric to the U.S. and Canadian
   military this year. The material, called Quantum Stealth, bends light
   waves around the wearer without the use of batteries, mirrors, or
   cameras. It blocks the subject from being seen by visual means but also
   keeps them hidden from thermal scans and infrared.

6. Spray-On Skin

   ReCell by Avita Medical is a medical breakthrough for severe-burn
   victims. The technology uses a postage stamp-size piece of skin from
   the patient, leaving the donor site with what looks like a rug burn.
   Then the sample is mixed with an enzyme harvested from pigs and sprayed
   back onto the burn site. Each tiny graft expands, covering a space up
   to the size of a book page within a week. Since the donor skin comes
   from the patient, the risk of rejection is minimal.

7. James Cameron Reached the Deepest Known Point in the Ocean

   Cameron was the first solo human to reach the bottom of the Mariana
   Trench. At 6.8 miles deep, it is perhaps more a more alien place to
   scientists than some foreign planets are. The 2.5-story "vertical
   torpedo" sub descended over a period of two and a half hours before
   taking a variety of samples.

8. Stem Cells Could Extend Human Life by Over 100 Years

   When fast-aging elderly mice with a usual lifespan of 21 days were
   injected with stem cells from younger mice at the Institute for
   Regenerative Medicine in Pittsburgh, the results were staggering. Given
   the injection approximately four days before they were expected to die,
   not only did the elderly mice live -- they lived threefold their normal
   lifespan, sticking around for 71 days. In human terms, that would be
   the equivalent of an 80-year-old living to be 200.

9. 3-D Printer Creates Full-Size Houses in One Session

   The D-Shape printer, created by Enrico Dini, is capable of printing a
   two-story building, complete with rooms, stairs, pipes, and partitions.
   Using nothing but sand and an inorganic binding compound, the resulting
   material has the same durability as reinforced concrete with the look
   of marble. The building process takes approximately a fourth of the
   time as traditional buildings, as long as it sticks to rounded
   structures, and can be built without specialist knowledge or skill
   sets.

10. Self-Driving Cars Are Legal in Nevada, Florida, and California

   Google started testing its driverless cars in the beginning of 2012,
   and by May, Nevada was the first state to take the leap in letting them
   roam free on the roads. With these cars logging over 300,000 autonomous
   hours so far, the only two accidents involving them happened when they
   were being manually piloted.

            Now we just need them to be marketed well so that people can
            start buying them by the crate load, with easy to read
            instructions on how to apply them to homes.

            The company defrauded the state of Mississippi many millions
            of dollars, didn't fulfill their obligations per their
            agreement, and sold off assets, patents, et al to GE at fire
            sale prices. All indications show that GE has no intention of
            further developing the product... which to me says that the
            product was smoke and mirrors since GE would absolutely
            develop a cheap solar tech if it worked.

            That happens more often than not when you read articles like
            these with "promising" technologies that are still years off.

            I don't know if that's true. What money is there in cheap and
            efficient? It's much more likely they'd sit on it.

            I don't know. It's incredibly important to the fact that we
            exist, but now that we know it exists, and the magic of its
            existence has passed, something more current would have to be
            mine. Like, perhaps, the eye implants. Or the stem cells. You
            know? Either way, it's a great time to be a scientist.

            I agree the Higgs Boson, if we can learn to manipulate it so
            we can remove moving masses from the Higgs field light speed
            here we come!

            Higgs boson will make the "Holodeck" more like the one from
            Star Trek:TNG. I give it 75 more years.
            Once we tap into that field it's end game time. Imagine no
            more problems with acceleration because we can negate some of
            our own mass. Epic.
            Higgs boson for sure.

       Now it all depends what they use it for. Just hate it when they
       mention it could be used by the military. And secondly, some are
       such breakthroughs that we will never seem them on the maket for
       many years, maybe never. Let the science roam free!

            Packy Fancher I dunno, maybe to go hunting for some really
            hard to find game. Or to observe different species out in the
            wild for behavioral patterns or migration patterns? Or bird
            watching?! I just don't like the idea of a military sniper
            being completely undetectable to radar and IR. That's a little
            too much power.

            can use us as slave. Ohhhh what the scientist use to do it.
            the human being will not be more like that. What is this
            advance for us to see what the human be in jail. If this kind
            of scientist discover will be for human to better without
            control and every thing will be use for the good of humanity
            without any slavery. I will say Al right. Human awake we are

            well human by now is rising up to 100 years old. In my family
            the gens are allowed this. and they are good. they are better
            than us more health. if they will be in treatment to it . they
            will be up to 200 years more and in natural way.....

            Life is what you make of it.

       While being a gamer, the holodeck is a pretty incredible concept.
       The idea of the flexible solar panel actually being able to compete
       with oil companies is the biggest surprise to me out the lot of
       these amazing triumphs in science.
       Above all though, the Stem cells come at the top of the list of
       importance. I am concerned about the repercussions if human life
       were to extend 100 years more then how we do now. I don't know what
       it would do to a human to live that long.

            Not so worried about what it would do to A human as what it
            would do to society. How would earth handle the population
            suddenly doubling? How would society handle it? I would rather
            have full quality of life for the 75'ish year average life
            span we have, than to live an extra 100 years given the
            choice.

            I have the same thoughts. Especially with how likely
            alzheimers is in old age. So we can make bodies live for 200
            yrs, but can the mind survive that?

            To that I would hope that they make more progress on
            Alzheimer's then. Find out what is causing the brain to
            deteriorate and reverse it or prevent it. THAT would be a
            game-changer in society, perhaps on the same tier as Cancer
            and AIDS.

            The Earth's carrying capacity is estimated at around 10
            billion but may decrease over time due to environmental damage
            and resource depletion. Also with the cheap flexible solar
            panels, power companies will do what ever they can to stop it
            because they wont be needed any more and they wont make money.

            I believe extending our lifetimes would be a HUGE mistake.
            We've already proven that we won't stop breeding, so where are
            we going to put the extra people? They've been extending
            education requirements steadily over the last several
            generations to keep people from flooding the job market as it
            is, and now they want to extend human life? Those people will
            have to work too. I think it may destroy society as we know
            it, and what are the odds that we'll replace it with something
            else that works in time? We won't even act concertedly to save
            our planet.

            This solar panel technology still doesn't compete with oil
            even at 100% solar efficiency. A barrel of oil still produces
            100 times more energy than a square meter of solar irradiance
            on a hot and sunny clear day (all day). Think about how many
            barrels you could stack on a square meter.

       Beaming images all over the room and compensating for furniture
       sounds a lot like the multi-projector systems that already exist.
       For example, about nine years ago, I was talking with a researcher
       at UdeM (Montréal, QC) who was telling me the differences between
       the two systems developed in the same department. Both systems
       involved cloaking objects in the room using a camera that watches
       where projected pixels end up on the walls. One of them was used
       repeatedly at the SAT arts centre. I wonder what is actually
       covered by that patent, because this whole thing I just wrote about
       is well-documented prior art.

       is it possible that if the human life span were to expand to more
       than twice the normal expectancy, that suicide would become a more
       common and socially acceptable practice? How would having such a
       long life span affect our appreciation and value for life and the
       virtues that we currently hold to be the highest in society today?

       3D printing is a massive step forward, as shown in a coupld of
       applications here. It really could spark a new kind of industrial
       revolution where people can affordable prototype inventions/create
       replacement parts for damages goods etc. Imagine snapping (for
       example) the handle off your fridge. Instead of having to send off
       and pay for a replacement you could just download the 3D plans for
       the part and create it yourself at a fraction of the cost.
       The invisibility cloak is also amazing, showing the progress being
       made in nano-technology.

       Hard to choose the 'most important', all of them are a step leading
       to a better new future. For me I like the fact that a blind man can
       now see with artificial augmentation , nothing can be as happy as
       his happiness.

       What I want is for Science to figure out how to interface the
       Internet with the Human Brain directly, so that we can all have
       normal lives whilst we are young and healthy, but as soon as our
       bodies start to fail we can have our brains placed in a small
       container and hooked up to the internet, allowing us to live
       possibly forever in virtual reality. Eventually all the people
       'living' in the real world would just be working to maintain the
       systems keeping the "VR population' alive.

            But stupid people will try to claim that the knowledge came
            from God. That's what Eric Hovind does, he says that all our
            knowledge comes from God because God is all knowing & humans
            can be wrong so you can't know anything unless God tells us.
            Something like that.

            No it does not, over population is a real concern as well as a
            bunch or useless people laying in hospital beds. think of your
            average person at 80, then 100..what exactly do you think you
            will be doing at 200? You can't be that afraid to die that you
            would rather lay there as a vegetable.
            And even if they managed to fully retain youth, the over
            population is still a big issue...we would have to limit new
            births and why because you want to live to be 200? no new
            babies because of your selfishness?
            80 to 100 years is more then enough.

       The stem cells that elongate life is the most important
       development. Simply because the brilliant minds that make the rest
       of these inventions would have twice as long to come up with newer,
       better ideas. Also, we could send people further into space with

       The stem-cell longevity thing, no doubt. If traded into a human
       technique to extend life, the social, ethical, spiritual,
       demographic and economic repercussions will carry the biggest
       impact of all the 27 subjects. Although the improvements in

            Well, the problem would be that it would cost a lot in time
            and effort to get to the planet. Then, to pay off that debt
            you would only have diamonds as "currency." Flooding the
            market with diamonds would reduce the value, making them no
            more valuable than much more common quartz, for example. There
            might be a pay off in utility of the diamond for industrial
            uses, though. And then, there is the use of the compact carbon
            as fuel. An interesting thought, nonetheless.

       Eye implants is probably the coolest thing on this list, closely
       followed by the invisibility cloak.

       Artificial leaves that produce hydrogen! Isn't the one major
       drawback of hydrogen cell cars being the fact that
       creating/splitting hydrogen from water uses huge amounts of energy,
       therefore cancelling out the environmental benefits of hydrogen
       powered cars? Cheap, green way to harvest hydrogen, goodbye fossil
       fuels!
       Same goes for the new solar panels. Surely these two have to be the
       most important advances for society!

       The Higgs's bosun, the advancements that help people live happier,
       more fulfilled lives, such as the robotic arm, exo-skeleton etc.
       and the mind-hacking. All amazing and useful stuff. With great
       power comes great opportunity and responsibility. Exciting times
       indeed!
       Just one observation on the item about Welsh flowering plants,

       if a human could live to be over 200 years old imagine the shift in
       lifestyle. We might actually get to sit down and enjoy ourselves

            Uh, how about the scientific method, to begin with. And the
            scientists of many disciplines that were the pioneers in
            science that count: Isaac Newton, Isaac Watt, etcetera.
            And then there are the concepts of peace, love, and yes, even
            tolerance. The study of "science" is only as useful as those
            who use it to promote such values that we get from "religion."

            Science does nothing, Darcy, it is the use of knowledge by
            mankind that gets things done. Like Nina said, without
            military dollars some of this stuff doesn't get done. As for
            religion and war, that is usually an excuse. Especially in
            today's world. Wars are fought for resources - be it land or
            raw materials. Beyond that, it's about power and control of
            others. Let us put the blame where blame belongs.

       who is into outer space may see the new planets as most important.

       I think the breakthroughs in stem cell research are the most
       important as they could bring huge benefits in terms of life
       expectancy, slowing the ageing process, organ transplantation and a
       real solution for cancer. The one that worries me the most is
       robotics research as much of this is being supported by military
       agencies. The idea of artificially conscious and autonomous
       machines with weapons is not a good prospect for a number of moral
       and practical reasons.

       fascinating and I cannot believe some of the accomplishments I just
       read. Amazing! However, more important than any accomplishment
       listed above, I would like researchers to find a way to prevent
       aggressive and violent behavior here on earth. Then, we can say
       that we have really evolved and progressed! How about it?

       The mobile EEG machine is huge success. Mobile brain scanning
       technology if used for good and honest research purposes can help
       take many laboratory confounded research topics out into the real
       world. I hope to legally research natural psychedelics during/after
       grad school and that would open up many new possibilities. Very
       neat!

       years! I think that is most important! get on it asap then we all
       can achieve much more as a civilization!

            many people would be clogging the senior homes and draining
            the health care system. It said we could live another 100
            years or more but it said nothing about being young and lively
            at the same time. >.<

       Energy (solar) developments are most cool, as that is a global

       Cybernetics is second coolest.
       Robotics, particularly the self-driving car are third coolest.
       Everything else is still really cool, though.

       They're all important, but most important are the eye implants and
       the cloak. Also the spray on skin. It would be useful in first aid
       situations. I read about exterior skeletons in an old book about
       bionics, back in 9th grade. What NASA is now using, is just an
       updated version of what was in the book.

       The additional life span afforded to mice using stem cells is, to
       me personally, the most important. What I find most fascinating is
       several of these technologies developing all at once. The brain
       controlled computers combined with the exo-skeletons combined with
       flexible glass combined with high capacity solar cells just make my
       head spin at the possibilities. Add in the discovery of the Higgs
       Bosun and I feel like I'm in a John Ringo world.

       Unfortunately, #27 isn't as cool as it sounds. It's called the
       Illumiroom and it's basically like projecting images onto the
       walls. The proof of concept is decent but hardly "seamless." This
       is it if you want to take a look.

       Stem cell life extention is by far the most important advancement
       in human history. No other achievements even comes close to the
       magnitude and significants to human life. The ability for a single
       researcher to spend an extented lifetime to complete their
       findings. The possibility for an explorer to travel to another
       solar system. The ability to experience the advancements of human
       achievements. Nations will be able to have leaders with over
       hundreds of years of knowledge, wisdom and experience. This
       achievement is right up there with the discovery of Fire and the
       Wheel. Nothing else can compare.

       research, etc., then our patent system really is f'ed up. That's

       I see a few things that will get religions up in arms, and some
       that others have been preaching against, such as solar, of course
       preaching against solar is mostyl due to who is president.
       Extending life spans would be cool though it has it's own can of
       worms, however that's why we're trying to colonize space.
       Plus, let's be honest, if such a thing came to fruition, the
       average populace wouldn't be able to use it and it would mostly be
       used by celebrities and politicians, not scientists or artists.

            Chris. And those that do promote traditional energy over solar
            and wind, do not do so on 'religious' grounds. You are
            confusing "conservatism" with being "religious."

       The company behind the invisibility cloak had not released any
       evidence of their technology. No one has ever seen their product in
       the flesh, nor has the company released any details as to how it is
       made or what it is made of. One must assume it is a hoax. See for
       yourself. This is the company's website:

            Based on the evidence, I'd say this is very much real. The
            product has been seen in use, but those that "need to know."
            The fact that the media has not been handed the "proof" does
            not make it a "hoax." Read the article again, Jonathan.

            What evidence??? Hyperstealth Technologies (the company behind
            this) has only shown "mock ups", meaning they have only shown
            Photoshopped, pretend versions. None of what you have seen by
            them is actually real. The burden of proof is on them
            demonstrate their claim. Until then, anyone with an ounce of
            common sense should assume it is a hoax.

       If you combine the exoskeleton, the light weight super strong silk,
       the mind controlling the computers, the fllexible super materials,
       the solar and photosynthesis cells, the camouflage technology and
       the google goggles all into one, we will be able to develop awesome
       military powered armors! Can't wait.

       1) Find a blind person willing to get the eyesight operation.
       2) Wait until his eyesight comes back.
       3) Take him into a room full of his friends and family, get them
       all to wear the invisibility material.
       4) Get them to talk to him and watch as his heart breaks.
       Harsh, but the greatest practical joke ever.

            will be covered in them and you will be getting a raise. Or GE

       The real question to me is will they be used for good or bad.
       Fighting robots, invisibility - all have Orwellian overtones. A
       robot that can outrun a man may be a good thing unless you are the
       one being chased. But aside from that gloomy concern, it is clear
       that the future has arrived and now we are just tweaking it. As for
       the most important, if the Higgs leads to our controlling gravity
       the say we do the other forces, it clearly is the winner.

       It feels to me like throughout civilization we've always been about
       enslavement of the earth, each other, animals, whatever for
       purposes of power. Advancement is awesome but I worry that it will
       further this human tendency to dominate every living thing. Think
       about those insane dictators who are alway out there dominating
       entire countries with their armies and brutality. Nuclear energy
       and bombs have made us all vulnerable to extinction, consequently.
       Do we use that knowledge wisely? Although these advancement are
       exciting, I wonder will mankind be able to use them for net
       positive reasons, to aid a better life or to terrorize/control good
       people deserving of freedom and happiness here?

       so if we can manipulate a theoretical higgs field sometime in the
       distant future, does that mean that (in theory) we could manipulate
       our own mass to a point of zero and achieve the speed of light?

       Several of these things together (spray on skin, giving sight,
       harking the brain, robotic abilities, leaf synthesizing,
       exoskeletons, extending life, creating from embryos, etc) could
       make a "human" (robotics) that photosynthesizes, lives longer,
       thinks faster, and project its vision in a holodeck, etc...a cyborg
       for real, and undetectable from another human. We would be so
       advanced ourselves, by then, we would give them equal rights as
       "carbon-based beings," even if they were "better" in many ways than
       we are. Eventually we'd become like them, rather than vice versa.

       harking the brain, robotic abilities, leaf synthesizing,
       exoskeletons, extending life, creating from embryos, etc) could
       make a "human" (robotics) that photosynthesizes, lives longer,
       thinks faster, and project its vision in a holodeck, etc...a cyborg
       for real, and undetectable from another human. We would be so
       advanced ourselves, by then, we would give them equal rights as
       "carbon-based beings," even if they were "better" in many ways than
       we are. Eventually we'd become like them, rather than vice versa.

       Self-Driving Cars Are Legal in Nevada, Florida, and California.
       Wrong, these states allow testing of Google's self-driving cars on
       the roads. Not just anyone. Get the facts right!

       many ways other than body parts.

       #20 Eye implant by far... Most of the other discoveries we will not
       be able to enjoy during our lifetime. Some we don't even have an
       understanding for, but eye sight, everyone can appreciate.

       I had heard speculation that the military was using a type of
       cloaking fabric on aircraft. So, I think the invisibility fabric is
       really cool.

       Anything that has to d with 3D printing. The possibilities are
       unlimited. You can now print toys for your children, or even a
       2-story house!

       The Microsoft patent is bullshit. They shouldn't be able to claim a
       theoretical idea.
