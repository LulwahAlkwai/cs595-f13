   The real-time curation and commenting platform Livefyre announced on
   Monday that it has acquired the social storytelling
   tool [48]Storify. Deal terms were not disclosed.

   Livefyre, which in February raised $15 million in venture
   funding, helps media companies and brands engage users through
   real-time social conversations, curation and advertising. Its 400-plus
   client base includes Conde Nast, TIME and the New York Times.

   Storify helps publishers tell stories by collecting tweets, photos,
   videos and media from across the web. Its staff of five will keep their
   positions and relocate to Livefyre's San Francisco office six blocks
   away.

   "The idea is to give publishers their own versions of Storify, inside
   their site," said Storify co-founder Burt Herman. "The goal of Storify
   is to impact how stories are going to be told, and how journalists are
   going to evolve and make stories on the social web."

   Approximately 850,000 journalists, agencies and brands use Storify.
   Now, the plan is to use Livefyre's reach to monetize it and reach more
   fans. Herman told Mashable that his small team didn't have the
   resources to take their service to the next level business-wise. Now he
   and his team can focus on product.

   "Brands are paying big bucks" for exposure, said Livefyre CEO Jordan
   Kretchmer, adding that his site can deliver millions of targeted
   impressions to relevant users. Companies can collect user-generated web
   content with Storify to supplement editorial content, which Livefyre
   will distribute onto their brands' websites, mobile apps and
   advertisements rather than linking out to Storify.

   Kretchmer said the end goal is to automate Storify stories,
   turning content production into a "fire hose experience."

   Livefyre clients will now receive Storify in their suite of Livefyre
   products. This means it will be available in their CMS and integrated
   in a slew of Livefyre tools such as live blogs, commenting and
   drag-and-drop video video.

   But don't worry if you don't have deep pockets like some Fortune 500
   brands that use the social storytelling service. The freemium model is
   still available, and paid user contracts will be grandfathered in.
   Storify's three paid tiers will be merged into a single enterprise rate
   and offered a la carte by Livefyre, which charges big clients six to
   seven figures for services. Kretchmer assures users that they will
   always be able to Storify for free.

   The deal is an unlikely pairing of a shark and remora (the tiny swimmer
   attached to the shark). Livefyre benefits from an attractive editorial
   tech tool that brings it closer to the social curation space; Storify
   can now take advantage of Livefyre's large business and sales
   divisions. Competitors like [51]RebelMouse and ScribbleLive offer
   similar capabilities, but none contain all of Livefyre's features in
   one place.

   "Livefyre has already built a sales team to go after publishers, and
   agencies, and media," Herman said. "We felt we could do much more, much
   faster [by selling]."
