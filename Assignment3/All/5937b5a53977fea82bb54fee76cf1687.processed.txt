   How to Run a Successful Project

The key is to understand and manage employees' emotional engagement with
their work

   by Benoit Hardy-Vallee

   As described in the first article in this series, many projects fail
   because organizations put their practices before their people. This
   happens when organizations try to make an employee's human nature and
   emotional makeup fit their processes and policies. This traditional
   approach to project management emphasizes developing complex guidelines
   to manage projects across all phases -- from implementing phase
   reviews, performance metrics, and project steering committees to
   creating risk management dashboards.

   Are team members motivated to deliver results?

   When this happens, project managers become little more than bureaucrats
   who manage paperwork rather than projects, and teams may lose sight of
   the project's strategic purpose and objectives. The accumulation of
   meetings, committees, and forms creates more stress and workload, and
   it rarely improves outcomes.

   In these environments, project managers, project teams, and
   stakeholders can become bound by processes that neglect fundamental
   questions, including:
     * Do project team members know exactly what is expected of them? Are
       they clear about their roles?
     * Are team members motivated to deliver results? Are they engaged
       with the organization and the team?
     * Do team members feel like their opinions are heard and that they
       can safely express their opinions?
     * Is there someone who motivates team members and recognizes their
       good work?
     * Do team members get along well? Do they care about each other,
       about quality, and about meeting the project's objectives?
     * Do team members treat the project stakeholders with fairness,
       respect, and trust?
     * Do stakeholders trust the project team? Do they feel that the team
       delivers?
     * Are stakeholders engaged with the project team? Are they passionate
       about the project and the team?
     * Would stakeholders keep using the project team's services if they
       could opt out? How likely are they to recommend the team and its
       members for other projects?

   Traditional project management does not give enough attention to these
   elements because they are more difficult to manage with processes or
   because they're dismissed as "soft issues." Yet they are crucial to a
   project's success.

   Emotions count

   Years ago, Gallup reported a key finding about human nature in the
   workplace: People have emotional needs, and if they are not attended
   to, the result is subpar performance and increased turnover. Even the
   best processes and systems are inefficient if the people who run them
   aren't emotionally invested in the outcome. To drive performance,
   organizations must engage their employees.

   The Three Types of Employees

   Engaged workers dedicate their energy to achieving their organization's
   objectives. They are committed, enthusiastic, loyal, and excited.
   Engaged employees are more productive, more profitable, more
   customer-focused, safer, and more likely to withstand temptations to
   leave the organization. They are also more engaging because engaged
   employees are more likely to elicit engagement from key stakeholders,
   such as their internal and external customers. A study by Gallup
   revealed that companies that applied best-practice principles
   optimizing employee and customer engagement at the workgroup level, for
   example, outperformed their five largest peers by 26% in gross margin
   and 85% in sales growth.

   Three key principles

   Project managers know that their work is constrained by scope, time,
   and cost. Project teams are expected to deliver on all three counts and
   to adjust one when the others change. Successful project teams,
   however, are able to overcome the limits of these constraints. That
   happens when project managers successfully manage people and processes
   by understanding and putting into practice three key principles:

   1. Project team member engagement. Just like any workgroup, a project
   team needs to be emotionally engaged to achieve its objectives
   efficiently and effectively.

   2. Stakeholder engagement. A project team must have strong emotional
   bonds and partnerships with its stakeholders to succeed.

   3. Optimizing performance. Highly engaged teams with highly engaged
   stakeholders are much more likely to achieve objectives within scope
   and budget and with high quality.

   A behavior-based approach to project management works toward optimizing
   performance by actively measuring, managing, and aligning project team
   member engagement and stakeholder engagement.

   Historically, businesses have overlooked or ignored emotional drivers.

   Project team member engagement measures the level of commitment,
   involvement, and motivation within a team. Engagement has a strong
   impact on project performance on key deliverables such as scope, cost,
   quality, and timeliness. Engaged team members:
     * know what to do and are able to do it. Teams cannot function
       effectively if team members lack clarity about what is expected of
       them. Team members need to know how what they do fits in the
       overall project and the appropriate tools to do their work.
     * contribute meaningfully to the project. Engaged team members have
       the opportunity every day to use their strengths to do what they do
       best. They also have a project manager who cares about them and who
       provides coaching and recognition.
     * work together as a team. Engaged team members are motivated and
       feel connected to the team's broader goals. They work together to
       create high-quality outcomes and develop trusting relationships.
     * learn and grow. To be engaged, team members need feedback about
       their progress individually and as a team. They also need
       opportunities to develop in areas related to their role or in areas
       that will prepare them for future roles or jobs.

   Stakeholder engagement describes the health of internal or external
   customer relationships. A stakeholder is often thought of as a sponsor,
   a project manager, an internal or external customer, or a project
   resource. But a stakeholder can be any person, team, or organization
   that has an interest in the successful completion of a project.
   Consistent with other Gallup findings on customer engagement, engaged
   stakeholders:
     * have Confidence that the project team is completely trustworthy and
       always keeps its promises.
     * know that the project team stands firmly behind its work and treats
       its stakeholders fairly and with Integrity.
     * feel Pride, which reflects the benefits of associating with the
       project team and its products or services.
     * have Passion for the project and project team. This is the ultimate
       expression of a strong emotional bond and reflects the belief that
       the project and team are a perfect fit for achieving the
       stakeholders' goals.

   Optimized performance results from managing the engagement of project
   team members and the engagement of stakeholders. To increase the
   emotional alignment between teams and stakeholders, organizations
   should ensure that project team member engagement and stakeholder
   engagement are consistently monitored and improved using Gallup's
   employee and customer engagement measures.

   If a team's engagement score is low on the recognition indicator, for
   example, then the project manager and team should work together on a
   plan to increase recognition. If a stakeholder engagement score is low
   on the Confidence indicator, the team should consult with the
   stakeholders to identify the cause and devise a plan to regain their
   trust.

   Implementing behavior-based project management

   To implement a behavior-based project management approach, Gallup
   recommends intervention at the organizational, project management
   office, and project team levels for optimum impact and results.
   Sustaining improvement in the relationship between team members and
   stakeholders requires disciplined action at the project team level
   coupled with an organization-wide commitment to changing how team
   members are positioned in roles, how they are rewarded and recognized,
   and most importantly, how they are managed.

   Emotions play an important role in all these interactions, and the
   emotional engagement of the project team members helps them deliver
   projects that are on time, within budget, and within scope. Project
   team member engagement affects how stakeholder requirements are
   achieved; it also affects the strength of team members' relationships
   with each other and with their stakeholders -- which in turn stimulates
   performance.

   Historically, businesses have overlooked or ignored these emotional
   drivers. But that neglect comes at a cost, and it's reflected in the
   project team's performance. Understanding and accepting that people are
   strongly influenced by emotion can help project managers optimize their
   teams' performance. It's far more effective to fit practices to people
   -- and success is far more likely as a result.
