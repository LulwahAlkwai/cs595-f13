   The Pomegranate phone is the ultimate all-in-one device. It puts more
   things in the palm of your hand than you ever thought possible: phone,
   email, full internet browsing, camera, video, MP3 player, GPS
   navigation. It is the only smart phone in the world that includes a
   built-in projector, global voice translator, coffee brewer, shaver and
   harmonica. Imagine all the things you can do: make a fresh cup of
   coffee anywhere with the built-in coffee maker, watch movies or
   presentations up to a 72 inch screen size, speak any language you
   choose, shave and talk, and even play the phone as a harmonica. The
   Pomegranate is full of amazing features, just like the fruit it's named
   after.
