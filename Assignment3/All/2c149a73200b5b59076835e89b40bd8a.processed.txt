[26]Why did Kickstarter ban GMOs?
       Studio20profile By [27]David Holmes
       On August 2, 2013
       Planting Seeds
       On Wednesday, Kickstarter changed its [28]guidelines, adding a ban
       on offering genetically modified organisms as rewards. The move
       came a few weeks after [29]Glowing Plants raised $484,013 to
       engineer light-emitting plants, a project its creators call "the
       first step in creating sustainable natural lighting."
       When asked why they banned GMOs, Kickstarter offered the following
       [30]anti-explanation to the Verge: "we aim to be as open as
       possible while protecting the health and creative spirit of
       Kickstarter for the long term."
       It's notable that they use the word "health" in their response. One
       of the big points made by anti-GMO activists is that they're not
       safe to eat. However, there is [31]no substantial peer-reviewed
       scientific evidence to suggest that any GM foods on the market
       today are harmful to humans. On top of that, Kickstarter didn't ban
       GM foods, but all GMOs. And as far as I know, I haven't seen any
       stories that bioluminescent GMO plants cause skin cancer or
       anything like that (though that'd be a hell of a headline).
       But regardless of what you think of GMOs, the case brings up a
       larger discussion that has haunted Kickstarter for the past few
       weeks: What drives Kickstarter's decisions to ban or take down
       projects?
       This isn't the first new ban of the summer. In June, the company
       [32]was widely criticized over a campaign to fund a "seduction
       guide" intended to teach men how to pick up women (including women
       who clearly didn't want to be picked up). The funding date came and
       went so it was too late to take down the campaign. But Kickstarter
       [33]issued an apology and banned future campaigns involving
       "sex/seduction guides."
       While they may not be in good taste, are all sex/seduction guides
       deplorable, or just the ones written by people who promote sexual
       assault? Neil Strauss' [34]"The Game" was good enough for the New
       York Times best seller list, but not Kickstarter? And while that
       was nominally an expose of pick-up culture, I've talked to more
       than a few awkward young men who view it as a de facto seduction
       guide. Meanwhile, other headscratching items banned from
       Kickstarter include sunglasses, makeup and "social networking
       apps." What app doesn't have a social component these days?
       (Note, I'm not saying that the offensive seduction guide in
       question should have been allowed to stay on Kickstarter. I'm
       saying Kickstarter should have flagged it from the start.)
       As for GMOs, yes there are risks beyond the as-yet unproven health
       concerns. People worry about modified genes spreading to organic
       fields, which is especially worrisome when the genes are patented,
       as some of Monsanto's are. But there are already laws in place that
       govern shipping and exporting plants or seeds. If Glowing Plants
       can prove that their project is legal (which they maintain it is)
       then why should Kickstarter care? And if the project isn't legal,
       why doesn't Kickstarter say so?
       Much like with the seduction guide scandal, it feels as if
       Kickstarter is merely reacting to public outcry by banning GMOs.
       [35]According to an ABC News survey, fifty-seven percent of
       Americans say they'd be less likely to buy foods labeled as
       genetically modified. And because it's such a hot-button issue,
       it's not hard to sympathize with Kickstarter for wanting to wash
       their hands of it completely.
       But I worry that Kickstarter is tossing the baby out of the window
       with these across-the-board bans. All GM crops are different,
       carrying unique impacts on the environment and economics. Plenty of
       GM research is devoted to [36]promoting sustainable farming
       practices. And sure, maybe it's not a debate that Kickstarter wants
       to get into, I get that. But Kickstarter videos can be expensive
       and time-consuming to make. And if the platform continues its
       reputation of unilateral bans and vague explanations, then
       potential crowdfunders might just as easily not take the risk, and
       bring their business elsewhere.

       Earlier this week, a Tesla Model S crashed after hitting a "large
       metal object" then subsequently caught fire. (The lone passenger
       exited the vehicle before the fire broke out and it never spread to
       the interior cabin). Now, Tesla's Elon Musk is speaking out about
       why the car caught fire. It started in the battery and Musk says
       that if the same accident had occurred involving a traditional
       gasoline-fueled car, the result would have been much worse.
