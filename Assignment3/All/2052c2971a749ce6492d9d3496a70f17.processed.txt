"Artisanal" Publishing

   Welcome to the APE: Author, Publisher, Entrepreneur--How to Publish a
   Book website. This site contains all the information you need to buy,
   review, and use APE.

   In 2011 the publisher of Guy Kawasaki's New York Times bestseller,
   Enchantment, could not fill an order for 500 ebook copies of the book.
   Because of this experience, Guy self-published his next book, What the
   Plus! and learned first-hand that self-publishing is a complex,
   confusing, and idiosyncratic process. As Steve Jobs said, "There must
   be a better way."

   With Shawn Welch, a tech wizard, Guy wrote APE to help people take
   control of their writing careers by publishing their books. The thesis
   of APE is simple but powerful: When a self-publisher successfully fills
   three roles--author, publisher and entrepreneur--the potential benefits
   are greater than with traditional publishing.

   Guy and Shawn call this "artisanal publishing."

   Artisanal publishing features writers who love their craft, and who
   control every aspect of the process from beginning to end. In this new
   approach, writers are no longer at the mercy of large, traditional
   publishers, and readers will have more books to read.

   APE is 300 pages of tactical and practical inspiration. People who want
   a hype-filled, get-rich-quick book should look elsewhere. On the other
   hand, if you want a comprehensive and realistic guide to
   self-publishing, APE is for you.

   "There must be a better way."
   - Steve Jobs

Blurbs

   "As digitization creates a revolutionary opportunity for writers to
   become their own publishers a new self-publishing infrastructure has
   emerged. This book will become the standard guide to this new
   publishing universe."

   Jason Epstein, former editorial director of Random House and co-founder
   of On Demand Books.

   "Nuts, bolts, and inspiration too. Once again, Guy delivers, kicking
   the shiitake out of anyone who would tell you that you shouldn't,
   wouldn't or couldn't write a book."

   Seth Godin, author and founder of The Icarus Project.

   "Guy's book is the perfect companion on the journey of independent
   publishing and great reading for the millions who aspire to become
   authors."

   Atif Rafiq, General Manager, Kindle Direct Publishing at Amazon.com

   "APE is easily the most comprehensive, best organized,
   nuts-and-bolts-useful work on self-publishing I've seen to date. I
   think Guy has written the bible on self-publishing, and I expect it
   will be recognized--and widely used--as such."

   Barry Eisler, bestselling novelist of the John Rain series including
   The Detachment, Requiem for an Assassin, and The Last Assassin.
