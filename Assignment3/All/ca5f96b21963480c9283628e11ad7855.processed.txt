Overview

     Weâve got to have the brightest minds to help solve our biggest
     challenges.[12]President Barack Obama

     We need the top entrepreneurs to work with us on opportunities that
     are actual pain points and needs of government. San Franciscoâs EIR
     program advances our role and vision as the Innovation Capital of
     the World. [13]Mayor Ed Lee

   San Francisco's EIR program, offered by the [14]Mayor's Office, will
   select talented entrepreneurial teams and help them develop
   technology-enabled products and services that can capitalize on the
   $140+ billion (See [15]Federal IT Spending and [16]State & Local IT
   Spending) public sector market by providing them with direct and
   ongoing access to government needs and opportunities, staff, their
   expertise and their pain points. The entrepreneurial products or
   services should drive significant impact such as increased revenue,
   enhanced productivity or meaningful cost savings.

   Entrepreneurs will get to work side-by-side senior government officials
   to work on opportunities that are actual pain points and needs of the
   government. In addition, products and services that successfully solve
   issues faced by San Francisco can easily expand to addressing similar
   needs of other cities and states across the nation in addition to the
   private sector.

   San Francisco's EIR program will offer each selected team mentorship
   from senior public leaders across the Mayor's office and San Francisco
   departments and from entrepreneurial and private sector leaders in
   addition to product development and ramp up support, and access to a
   gold-mine of government problems and insights through the City and
   County of San Francisco.

   The program will bring together meaningful opportunities and talented
   entrepreneurs to drive innovative solutions in key areas such as data,
   mobile and cloud services, healthcare, education, transportation,
   energy and infrastructure. The program expects to select 3 to 5 teams.
   The program will last 16 weeks from mid-October, 2013 through
   mid-February, 2014.

   through the City and County of San Francisco.

FAQ

   Please read over the questions below before submitting your
   application. If your question isn't answered here, reach out via the
   [25]contact form below or [26]@sfmoci), and we'll get back to you
   shortly.

Why is the program unique?

   Entrepreneurs get to work directly with the City and County of San
   Francisco to develop solutions for pain points and needs of the
   government, the largest consumer of products and services in the
   nation. In addition, products and services that successfully solve
   issues faced by San Francisco can easily expand to addressing similar
   needs of other cities and states across the nation in addition to the
   private sector. This is one of the first programs of its kind run by
   the City itself. This program is not meant to be a traditional
   accelerator or incubator, but to help formalize the process for smaller
   businesses and entrepreneurs to navigate the complexity of the public
   sector.

Who is the target entrepreneur?

   We are looking particularly for entrepreneurial teams who recognize
   that challenge and opportunity go hand-in-hand. It is also critical
   that the EIRs think about solving problems at a large scale. Pain
   points and issues faced by government need technology enabled products
   and services that can scale well and can function across multiple
   environments and across different types of users. And we want EIRs who
   think big! As an analogy, weâre looking for teams who instead of
   building an app that tells you when the train is delayed, build a
   product that helps the trains run on time.

What is the the opportunity in San Francisco?

   The City and County of San Francisco has an annual budget over $8
   billion. It has more than 28,000 employees across more than 50
   departments and agencies. As the innovation capital of the world, we
   offer a well-recognized platform to expand to other public sector
   buyers across the nation. For an interactive view of the city budget
   and related revenues and expenditures,Â [27]visit SFOpenBook.

Does my team have to spend 16 weeks "embedded" in San Francisco government
offices?

   While you do not have to be physically in City offices every day, we
   need companies and teams that are in the Bay Area or are willing to
   have at least some of the team here over the course of 16 weeks. The
   program is set up to provide a four month runway for you to work with
   government on developing a product or service that meets the needs of a
   department or agency and can be applied more broadly. To that end, we
   work with you to establish a reasonable roadmap over that timeframe.
   This will vary by team. The best use of that time depends on your
   team's stage and needs. We want you to be successful and understand
   that if you're building a business, you'll have to be doing other
   things as well.

Is this a full-time or part-time commitment?

   You have to be a full-time entrepreneur. However, your time commitment
   to the program is flexible depending on your needs and stage. We
   recognize that building a business requires having many demands on your
   time and we appreciate that. We will offer you a variety of resources
   and insights and it is up to you how much youâd like to benefit from
   them.

What do you mean when you say the product or service has to be
self-sustaining?

   We want you to develop a successful product or service that is valuable
   to government here in San Francisco and across other cities, states and
   at the federal level. We expect you to ramp up your business through
   competitive and compelling offerings that governments consider
   purchasing because it has a measurable impact such as increased
   revenue, lower costs or enhanced productivity.

How does the EIR program relate to other civic programs like Code for
America's Civic Accelerator?

   The SF EIR program is part of a growing ecosystem of civic innovation.
   Inspired by [28]Code for Americaâs Civic Accelerator, and joined by
   [29]Points of Light and [30]Tumml among others, the EIR program seeks
   to offer another pathway to addressing civic challenges. This is not an
   accelerator or incubator program, but rather a method for the City and
   County of San Francisco to formally match entrepreneurs working on
   products that serve or could serve government to various city agencies
   and departments. It is our belief that creating a formal pathway can
   help these entrepreneurs more easily navigate the complexity of working
   in the public sector and bring better fit solutions to the challenges
   of government. We applaud CfA's pioneering work in this space and hope
   our program spurs more entrepreneurs to work on civic problems.
