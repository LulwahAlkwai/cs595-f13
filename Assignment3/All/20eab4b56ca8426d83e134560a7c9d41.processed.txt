Twitter's Private Filing Signals New Wave of Secrecy

   Bloomberg
   [48]Follow @bloombergnews

   Twitter Inc., the business that thrives on a culture of excessive
   sharing, is taking a more discreet route to its initial public
   offering, adopting a strategy that others will follow.

   The microblogging service sent out a 24-word [49]tweet yesterday
   announcing that it had confidentially filed to go public with the U.S.
   Securities and Exchange Commission. It provided no financial details or
   time frame.

   Twitter filed under the Jumpstart our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act
   signed last year. The legislation lets companies with less than $1
   billion in annual revenue keep their most sensitive information away
   from the competition and the public until shortly before they promote
   the offering. Investors had better get used to the secrecy as a host of
   emerging technology companies, including Box Inc., Airbnb Inc., Square
   Inc. and Dropbox Inc., are likely to take the same path.

   "There's a lot of stress in preparing for an IPO," said Jeff Crowe, a
   partner at [50]Norwest Venture Partners in [51]Palo Alto,
   [52]California, and director at RetailMeNot Inc., which went public
   under the JOBS Act in July. "One stress you don't want to have is
   tipping off the competition any sooner than you have to about what your
   business model is like."

   Under the rules for so-called emerging-growth companies, Twitter's
   review process with the SEC will be confidential until at least 21 days
   before the road show, where the company will pitch investors before
   setting a final price.

Less Costly

   The JOBS Act was created to simplify the IPO process for smaller
   companies and make it less expensive to go public. Between audited
   financial statements and legal costs, companies spend on average $3.7
   million for their IPOs in addition to underwriter fees, according to a
   [53]report last year from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

   Most businesses that can are taking advantage of the rule. Carter Mack,
   an investment banker who served on the [54]task force that wrote the
   recommendations for the IPO portion of the act, estimates that more
   than 80 percent of emerging-growth companies are filing confidentially.

   "There's a big backlog," said Mack, president and co-founder of JMP
   Group Inc. in [55]San Francisco. "Twitter filed because of that and
   because Internet stocks have done well recently."

   Twitter is just small enough to qualify. The company's advertising
   revenue is projected to rise 63 percent to $950 million next year from
   $582.8 million this year, according to EMarketer Inc.

Up Next

   A group of companies with billion-dollar valuations on the private
   market will be watching closely. Box Chief Executive Officer Aaron
   Levie said earlier this year that his business-software company will
   likely go public in 2014. Airbnb, operator of a home-rental website,
   was valued at $2.5 billion last year. Square, the payments startup run
   by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, achieved a valuation of $3.25
   billion a year ago after an investment from Starbucks Corp., while
   document storage provider Dropbox was valued at $4 billion in a 2011
   financing.

   Representatives from Box and Dropbox didn't immediately respond to
   requests for comment. [56]Kim Rubey, a spokeswoman for Airbnb, declined
   to comment, as did Aaron Zamost, a spokesman for Square.

   Twitter is unusual in even announcing that it's filed. Most JOBS Act
   candidates, including [57]Workday Inc. (WDAY), Tableau Software Inc.,
   Ruckus Wireless Inc. and RetailMeNot, didn't disclose anything until
   making their S-1 prospectus public.

Musk's Exception

   SolarCity Corp. was an exception. The provider of rooftop solar
   systems, whose chairman is Elon Musk, announced its confidential filing
   in a press release in April 2012. The company filed its public S-1 on
   Oct. 5, ahead of the December debut.

   Some high-profile Internet IPOs that filed under standard disclosure
   rules paid the consequences of heightened scrutiny.

   [58]Facebook Inc. (FB), which held one of the biggest IPOs in U.S.
   history last year, lost more than half its value in the months
   following the deal. The prospectus was pored over for three months
   before the offering by analysts, investors and reporters.

   [59]Groupon Inc. (GRPN) fell by more than three-quarters after its 2011
   debut and was publicly ridiculed during the SEC review because of its
   accounting methods and exorbitant losses. Neither of those companies
   would have been eligible for the JOBS Act provision, because they were
   too big.

Market Rally

   Sixteen months have passed since Facebook's troubled offering and the
   market has bounced back. The social-networking service is finally
   trading above its IPO price and other consumer-Web companies like
   Trulia Inc. and RetailMeNot have soared since their IPOs.

   In addition to the JOBS Act, "we're seeing a recovery from the hangover
   effect of the [60]Facebook IPO," Crowe said.

   For its size, hype and growth, Twitter is not the kind of company that
   the JOBS Act was designed for, said [61]Erik Gordon, a private-equity
   and law professor at the [62]University of Michigan in [63]Ann Arbor,
   who spoke with legislators when the bill was being drafted.

   Twitter is valued at more than $10 billion, based on a public filing
   last month from an investor. It can afford the IPO process and won't
   have difficulty attracting underwriters and investors, Gordon said. He
   said the revenue cap for an emerging-growth company should be lowered
   to $500 million.

   "Twitter is the last IPO in the world that needs the benefits of the
   JOBS Act," Gordon said. It's unfair to investors, who get "a shorter
   period in which the S-1 is public for you to tear it apart and do a
   thorough analysis," he said.
