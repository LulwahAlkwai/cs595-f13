The iPhone 5S just brought us closer to the internet of things and a world of
constant surveillance

   By [101]Siraj Datoo -- September 10, 2013

   Sensors have played a role in mobile devices for years, even if it was
   simply a compass designed to help phone users find their bearings (in
   the woods, supposedly). Yet at Apple's iPhone launch today, the company
   announced a "motion co-processor," the M7 chip, on its higher-end
   iPhone 5S. The chip's job is to continuously monitor the phone's motion
   sensors--its accelerometer, a gyroscope and compass.

   Again, these sensors in themselves are nothing new. But dedicating a
   special chip to watch them is. The M7, paired with something called the
   CoreMotion API--a piece of software that delivers the motion data in
   usable form to any app that requests it--means app developers will now
   be able to put Apple's sensors to more use.

   One such app, featured in Apple's announcement, is the Nike+ Move app.
   It seems to be a way to get your phone to keep track of your every
   step, much like Nike's Fuelband wrist monitor or similar devices like
   the Fitbit Flex or the Jawbone UP. It remains to be seen why Nike would
   give people a reason not to buy its Fuelbands.

   But this is just part of a broader trend towards always-on sensors.

   Samsung, in its Galaxy S3 and S4 phones, puts the standard
   accelerometer to some novel uses; for instance, you can turn over the
   phone to reject a call or zoom in and out of a picture by moving the
   phone back and forth. But the recently-launched S4 also includes
   [102]temperature and humidity sensors. Users can make the most of them
   by downloading apps such as [103]WeatherSignal, which turns your phone
   into a miniature measuring station for a crowd-sourced weather map.

   Motorola's new Moto X is always listening. Its built-in audio chip
   specializes in noise cancellation and speech recognition. (Samsung
   devices too can listen out for specific words, like "Hello Samsung").
   Yet the device will also "anticipate" user movements, [104]according to
   AllThingsD. Hold your phone up as if you're about to take a photo and
   the camera will switch on for you.

   Such devices could hasten the advent of the "internet of things," a
   vision of a world in which countless mundane objects, from shoes to
   cars to doors, are connected to, and can be monitored and controlled
   over, the internet. The problem with the vision is that it's costly to
   put sensors in lots of things. But a phone's built-in sensors can do a
   lot of the same tasks.

   Thanks to the ubiquity of mobile phones, some of these kinds of data
   are already being compiled. Google Maps, for instance, collects data on
   the movements of millions of phones that use the app to build up
   detailed maps of traffic. If all phones had temperature and humidity
   sensors, WeatherSignal could do the same for weather. Sound data could
   provide information about neighborhoods that are particularly noisy or
   even help police pinpoint disturbances.

   Aside from the obvious privacy concerns, up to now one of the main
   obstacles to always-on sensors in phones has been that they drain
   battery power. We don't yet know whether the new iPhone will solve that
   problem. But you might as well get used to the idea that your phone is
   passively collecting more information on you than ever.
