College Professors Are About to Get Really Mad at President Obama

     * By [94]Jonathan Chait

   [95]0
   [96]0
   NATIONAL LAMPOONS ANIMAL HOUSE, John Belushi, 1978. This tuition bill
   is really outrageous! Especially given my GPA.

   Probably the most important policy idea in President Obama's economic
   speech yesterday was his commitment to control the rising cost of
   college tuition. Health care is a good analogy to think about this.
   During Obama's first term, he became convinced that simply expanding
   access to the uninsured couldn't work as long as medical costs kept
   spiraling out of control, and this commitment forced him to support a
   wide range of unpopular cost-control measures, some of which put him
   crossways with members of his own party. (Some unions are [97]still mad
   about health care reform for that reason.)

   Obama's college agenda started off as a classic Democratic agenda of
   increasing access by making student loans more generous. But he's come
   to think of college tuition costs as essentially the same problem.
   Yesterday's speech included a pretty long riff on this issue, which
   mostly escaped attention:

     Families and taxpayers can't just keep paying more and more and more
     into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and
     up and up. We'll never have enough loan money, we'll never have
     enough grant money to keep up with costs that are going up five,
     six, seven percent a year. We've got to get more out of what we pay
     for.

     Now, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to
     a degree or blending teaching with online learning to help students
     master material and earn credits in less time. And some states are
     testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students
     enroll but how many of them graduate, how well do they do.

   GALESBURG, IL - JULY 24: President Barack Obama addresses the state of
   the economy during a speech at Knox College on July 24, 2013 in
   Galesburg, Illinois. Obama is scheduled to speak later today in
   Warrensburg, Missouri. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)

   Obama pledged to unveil most of the details in a subsequent speech.
   Some elements will probably involve executive action, including
   encouraging colleges to take steps on their own. (Obama promised to
   "call college presidents.") The ultimate solution is probably going to
   require some kind of legislation, and [98]David Wessel previews some
   good ideas along these lines.

   But this agenda is also likely to create even deeper fissures within
   the Democratic agenda than cost control did. After all, there isn't a
   much more loyal Democratic constituency than people who work in higher
   education.

   Jonathan Rees's [99]polemic in Slate against MOOCs today is an
   important preview of the coming fight within the Democratic base. MOOC
   stands for "massive open online course," which is a super-cheap way to
   provide college instruction. It's one of the tools Obama referenced as
   a solution to the tuition crisis. The concept is extremely new, and the
   trick is to develop it in such a way that you can weed out cheating,
   and ensure that students really learn. If you can do that, then
   prestigious universities can start providing degrees for their online
   courses, and you would have a powerful, extremely affordable new path
   for cash-strapped kids to obtain the benefits of a college degree.

   Rees argues that this is a terrible idea that can't possibly work, and
   urges his fellow academics to fight it with every fiber of their being.
   Why do we know it's a terrible idea? Here is his entire explanation:

     How do you teach tens of thousands of people anything at once? You
     don't. What you can do over the Internet this way is deliver
     information, but that's not education. Education, as any real
     teacher will tell you, involves more than just transmitting facts.
     It means teaching students what to do with those facts, as well as
     the skills they need to go out and learn new information themselves.

   But, uh - are we sure the only way to teach people what to do with
   facts is face-to-face? This seems like something that could at least
   conceivably be taught to more than one person at once. I can remember
   lots of professors teaching me what to do with facts via lectures in
   extremely large auditoriums, which is not that different than a lecture
   you watch online. Nobody claims that the technical barrier has been
   solved, but it's amazing that Rees is already declaring it unsolvable.

   After this brief assertion that online college can never work, Rees
   proceeds to the guts of his argument: it's bad for college professors.
   Rees writes, "the beauty of MOOCs is that they provide an easy
   opportunity to drastically cut labor costs by firing existing faculty
   members or simply hiring poorly trained ones -- whom they won't have to
   pay well -- to help administer the class." Well, yeah. Given that
   college is unbelievably expensive, isn't that a good thing? No, he
   says, because "Professors, believe it or not, are people, too. They
   have families and health problems and student loans of their own."
   The terms and conditions of our employment may be adversely affected.

   That is sad. College professors are good people, and nobody wants to
   hurt them. At the same time, designing a higher education system around
   maintaining living standards for college professors is an insane idea.
   The goal of the system ought to be making higher education effective
   and affordable for students. Rees waxes poetic about the joys of
   in-person liberal education, and I greatly enjoyed my classic college
   experience, with the gorgeous campus green and intramural basketball
   and watching campus protestors say interestingly crazy stuff at
   rallies. But insisting that's the only way a student ought to be able
   to get a degree, in an economy where a college degree is necessary for
   a middle-class life, is to doom the children of non-affluent families
   to crushing college debt, or to lock them out of upward mobility
   altogether.

   Rees urges his fellow academics: "It's time for us non-superprofessors
   to forcefully explain to our newly famous colleagues how their MOOCs
   are already adversely affecting the terms and conditions of our
   employment." Forcefully! Perhaps some of the students who can't afford
   to get a college degree should forcefully explain their plight to him.
