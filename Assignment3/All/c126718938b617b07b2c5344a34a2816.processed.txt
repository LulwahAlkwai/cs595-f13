                 [mmd_cover.jpg] Mining of Massive Datasets

   The book has now been published by Cambridge University Press. The
   publisher is offering a 20% discount to anyone who buys the hardcopy
   [1]Here. By agreement with the publisher, you can still download it
   free from this page. Cambridge Press does, however, retain copyright on
   the work, and we expect that you will obtain their permission and
   acknowledge our authorship if you republish parts or all of it. We are
   sorry to have to mention this point, but we have evidence that other
   items we have published on the Web have been appropriated and
   republished under other names. It is easy to detect such misuse, by the
   way, as you will learn in Chapter 3.

   Below is a draft, evolving version of the MMDS book. We have added
   [6]Jure Leskovec as a coauthor. There are two new chapters, on mining
   large graphs and dimensionality reduction. A chapter on large-scale
   machine learning is expected soon.

   There is a revised Chapter 2 that treats map-reduce programming in a
   manner closer to how it is used in practice, rather than how it was
   described in the original paper. Chapter 2 also has new material on
   algorithm design techniques for map-reduce.
