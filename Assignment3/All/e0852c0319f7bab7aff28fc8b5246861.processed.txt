[55]EPIC 2020

   EPIC 2020, stands for the proposition that the education of the world
   will change dramatically for the better during this decade. This site
   attempts to provide ideas that shatter the paradigm that the future
   will be anything like the past. The site is also my individual effort
   to provide a reasonably comprehensible resource of materials and tools
   related to online learning.  If you would like to be kept current
   please join the EPIC 2020 Facebook group in the upper right. The EPIC
   2020 video below was created as an out of the box stimulus to think in
   new ways about education.

   Comments from Martin Van Der Werf, T[60]he College of Education
   Blog: "Will higher education collapse in this manner? No, this is far
   too simplistic. But are there grains of truth and seeds of nightmares
   in this? I would argue Yes. This video should inspire a mixture of
   guffaws, inspiration, and feelings of dread in just about anyone who
   watches it. So, if nothing else, Sams has succeeded in starting a
   dialogue that any college thinking seriously about its future needs to
   have."

   Bill's Blog:

   I am doing a sort of weekly blog on various concepts related to
   education that can be found at [61]Skilled Up. Here are summaries of
   the posts and direct links. For full disclosure I am also an advisor to
   Skilled Up.

   [62]Sensory Overload: We are genetically designed to sense colors,
   forms, movement and sound as well as tastes and smells. Words and
   numbers -- creations of only a few thousand years ago -- have served us
   well until now, but perhaps we are now approaching a point of returning
   to our innate senses

   [63]Knowledge: Just in Case to Just in Time: How many times can you
   recall having asked a teacher `Why do I need to know this?' only to be
   told `because someday you will need it'? I'd argue that Just in Case
   knowledge is a massive waste of resources -- and in my own experience a
   large portion of what I learned in obtaining three degrees has either
   never been needed or was forgotten long ago.

   [64]Accounting for Human Capital: While there are well-established
   principles for accounting for tangible items of production there is a
   gapping hole in our ability to account for intangible items of
   production such as people. As we move into the knowledge economy, this
   shortfall in our collective accounting becomes a critical problem.
   Without a rigorous way to do this, we cannot provide a feedback loop
   that enables rational and proactive decisions that enhance the value
   and productive application of human capital.

   [65]All You Need is Knol: There is a truism in business that you only
   get what you measure. When you apply this to education it's no wonder
   that we have the current problems.

   [66]ISO 2020: The Importance of Standards in Education: If education
   were more like industry, students would be getting a better, faster and
   cheaper education than they now enjoy, with the data to back it up.

   [67]Holistic Enhancement: How to Value Human Capital: The idea of
   Holistic Enhancement, which I introduced recently, lays out a
   conceptual survey of the types of units and tools of measurement that
   should be in a definition of personal and organizational human capital.

   The concept of Holistic Enhancement was introduced at a COIL Fisher
   Speaker Series at Penn State in March of 2013. Here is the [68]link to
   my presentation.

   [69]Is a Degree an Investment? No. The degree as investment reasoning
   confuses selection bias with causation, ignores the depreciation rate
   of knowledge, and assumes that the value of a degree does not go
   obsolete.

   Connected Learning is a short video piece on "Might the information age
   free us to pursue learning centered on individuals and not
   institutions?" [70]Link.
