   Google's Spyglass: Google's reputation for pervasive spying is deeply
   troubling.
   This is what Scott Cleland is arguing in his latest post and I'm
   worried this impression, thanks to the NSA, doesn't just apply to
   Google anymore. But Google Glass does represent an unprecedented
   opportunity to violate privacy once it rolls to market thanks to its
   head mounted cameral. They were likely wise to hold it back because the
   right pictures of the wrong things from Glass, particularly when the
   camera can be remote controlled, could create huge problems. Read
   Scott's analysis here:
