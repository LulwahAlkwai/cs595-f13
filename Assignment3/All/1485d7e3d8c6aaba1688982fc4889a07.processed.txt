   When you're picking out a DVR for your home, there's a pretty short
   list of candidates--TiVo has its new 6-tuner DVRs, or you can get
   something from your cable provider, or you can roll your own. But
   consumer-grade DVRs don't really scale all that well for media
   companies that need to record and process lots of TV. When you've got
   30 or more channels that you need to be recording simultaneously, your
   cable company's DVR isn't really up to snuff anymore, and it's time to
   call in the big guns.

   Houston-based [9]SnapStream makes a line of DVRs that scale to truly
   silly sizes--its products are the monster trucks of the DVR world. If
   you watch TV at all, you've almost certainly already seen what
   SnapStream can do--popular shows like The Colbert Report, The Daily
   Show, The Soup, and tons of others are customers, using 30+ channel
   DVRs to record dozens and dozens of TV shows simultaneously in order to
   integrate clips from those recorded shows into their own.

   with neat TV memorabilia. Marketing director Rachel Eichenbaum's
   office, for example, features a Mad Men silhouette falling down against
   the skyline.

   But SnapStream's boxes do a lot more than simply record TV--they're
   actually a home theater PC geek's dream. Because Snapstream works so
   closely with media production companies, its DVRs sport functionality
   that no consumer set could possibly get away with having. For example,
   a SnapStream cluster is just as good at repackaging, transcoding, and
   distributing content for re-use as it is for recording it in the first
   place--functionality you won't find on a consumer-grade DVR. The system
   also gives users the most amazing TV guide access we've ever laid eyes
   on, wrapped in a simple and almost ludicrously fast GUI.

   Ars recently spent some time at SnapStream's Houston-based office to
   learn more about what the company's products do and how they do it.
   What we found was actually pretty surprising: the privately held
   company only has about twenty employees, but its products are
   everywhere--not just in media, but in just about any industry that
   needs to record and catalog video, including local, state, and federal
   governments.

   shows off some of the monster DVR's unique features.

From HTPC app to enterprise hardware

   SnapStream actually got its start as [12]Beyond TV, an early HTPC
   application that let Windows users record cable TV to their hard
   drives. The application was not free, but it was a more cost-effective
   way for users to get TiVo-like functionality without having to actually
   pay for a TiVo or other full DVR.

   By 2006, the proliferation of DVRs packaged with cable services began
   to significantly limit BeyondTV's mass-market appeal, since prospective
   customers could simply get a DVR bundled with their service rather than
   needing to build their own out of a spare PC. Looking for new
   opportunities, the BeyondTV folks began looking at companies using TVs
   and DVRs in a corporate environment, asking them what kind of a product
   they needed to make their businesses work.

   "It really boiled down to just recording more things at a time than
   your typical DVR can do," explained Aaron Thompson, SnapStream's
   president. "Being able to record, say, all of the news channels was
   something companies were interested in... The Daily Show, Colbert
   Report, and so on all use it to record a bunch of stuff, find what they
   want to make fun of, and quickly get it into their editing bays to get
   it on air."

   Prior to SnapStream, the big media companies were using isolated DVRs
   to record all the different television shows they needed to capture.
   "You look at these guys and you'd see two racks full of TiVos, and it's
   like 'okay, on this day, this show is on this TiVo, and on the next day
   the next day's show is on this other TiVo,' and it was a very manual
   and intensive process....being able to sit down at a single interface
   and find everything instantly was a big change for them."

   SnapStream's approach was to consolidate and scale up. Rather than
   relying on racks of isolated DVRs, SnapStream's enterprise DVR clusters
   together multiple capture servers that all pool together their storage.
   The servers run Windows Server 2008R2 and the proprietary SnapStream
   application, and they each contain a stack of hard disk drives in a
   RAID 5 4+1 configuration. The SnapStream application uses Microsoft SQL
   Server for storing metadata, and recorded video files are stored on the
   NTFS-formatted file system as regular files. Larger customers can also
   use existing SAN or NAS systems as file stores--the SnapStream
   application is simply an application, relying on the operating system
   itself for file access, and so anything Windows can use as storage,
   SnapStream can use.

   Video is typically ingested into the SnapStream DVRs directly from a
   cable feed at 480p, 720p, or 1080i through component inputs on
   heavy-duty QAM capture cards (typically costing up to $1500 each), thus
   bypassing the need for CableCard or any other type of integration with
   the cable infrastructure. However, this isn't always the case--many of
   SnapStream's media customers that share parent companies also share
   broadcast-resolution digital assets directly with each other over
   high-bandwidth private WAN links, skipping the cable network all
   together. The SnapStream DVRs can transcode and scale video from and to
   a variety of formats and resolutions and can even be used to output
   data over [15]SDI, so that recorded clips can be seamlessly integrated
   into a TV show's production workflow.

   The ability to record dozens of video streams isn't worth much without
   the ability to locate the things you're looking for among the pile of
   recorded shows, and SnapStream has an answer here, too: rather than
   rely on armies of interns to watch and catalog all the recorded TV,
   SnapStream peeks into the recorded shows' closed caption data and can
   search the entire recorded library for video based on keywords in the
   closed captions.

Caption search

   Seeing this in action was quite cool. To provide a quick demonstration,
   the SnapStream guys logged into one of their lab DVR clusters via its
   Web interface, then performed a search for "Obama." The search
   interface and results are formatted similarly to Google search results,
   with a quick textual blurb and a link. In this case, because the lab
   cluster had several days' worth of recorded TV from a number of local
   TV stations, we got quite a few hits on "Obama" as a search term.
   Clicking on any of the links took us directly to the TV program that
   contained the term, with the playhead ready to go right at the point in
   the program where the word was mentioned. The closed captions
   themselves were displayed to the right of the video.

   At this point, SnapStream's functionality really began to diverge from
   a consumer DVR. While I was watching, SnapStream Director of
   Engineering Jason Baumeister quickly positioned a set of brackets
   around a 15-second portion of the show and clicked a "Share" Button; he
   typed in my Ars Technica e-mail address, and within a few seconds my
   phone buzzed. In my inbox I had a link pointing back at SnapStream's
   servers that I could tap and, over my phone's 3G connection, watch a
   properly transcoded version of the clip Baumeister had just selected
   for me.

   The clip itself is treated as a separate object on the SnapStream DVR
   cluster, too; Baumeister and Thompson described how many of the media
   customers make extensive use of clipping in the run-up to production on
   their own TV shows. Folks involved with planning the evening run of The
   Soup, for example, can sit in a conference room with their laptops or
   tablets and quickly make and discuss clippings from the day's recorded
   reality TV shows, collaboratively dicing out the juiciest (soupiest?)
   bits of reality TV and assembling a rough playlist very quickly by
   searching for keywords, creating clips, and sharing them with each
   other.

   sued into oblivion.
   SnapStream

   Closed caption search aside, the system also features far and away the
   slickest TV guide grid I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing.
   SnapStream systems pull programming guide data from Tribune Media
   Services, just like most other programming guides do, but the way it
   displays the data is utterly utilitarian and supremely functional:
   within the SnapStream Web interface, the programming guide is a very
   simple AJAX-driven draggable grid. The grid actually reuses technology
   from a previous SnapStream project called [20]Couchville, which
   SnapStream discontinued in 2007. It looks and acts just like a regular
   DVR or Web programming guide, showing channels along one axis and times
   along another, but it can be dragged with the mouse and programs in the
   grid can be clicked to record, or clicked to play if they're already
   recorded. It's instantly responsive. No fluff, no cruft, no
   graphics--just a beautifully functional program guide. As with so many
   things about the system, it's a feature that consumer DVRs and HTPCs
   desperately need and almost certainly will never get.

   The reason for this and for the other features' absence on the consumer
   side is easy to articulate: at its core, the goals of the SnapStream
   system are at odds with the things that cable providers want DVRs to be
   able to do. "A lot of what our solution does is what they don't want
   you to do--I want to record this at one central place and view it at
   thousands of different locations, or take a portion of it and e-mail it
   out. That's exactly what the limitations [on consumer DVRs] are there
   to prevent," said Thompson.

   SnapStream, though, operates sort of on the other side of the curtain.
   The customers who are in the position to perform grand feats of
   copyright infringement are actually the exact same customers who would
   be filing the copyright infringement lawsuits. As long as the open
   recording and sharing of full broadcast-resolution TV stays in the
   realm of the media production companies making the TV in the first
   place, no one gets upset. And SnapStream let me know that they
   currently have no private individuals as customers--no crazy
   billionaires with SnapStream systems in their crazy billionaire
   mansions, so the systems all remain in the hands of ostensibly
   responsible, non-infringing entities.
