Technology and Jobs

   Entertainment Weekly [5]reported last month on the bankruptcy of the
   special effects company Rhythm and Hues and the troubled industry. I
   [6]remarked five years ago that the special effects industry lost its
   ability to surprise us. Without the ability to innovate, and with most
   of the effects handled in software, the need for specialized talent and
   companies disappears.
   We've always could take comfort that computation and its related
   efficiencies have led to more, often safer and higher paying jobs. But
   is that still true? The stock market has hit historic highs but the
   unemployment rate remains high. Are companies who pared down during the
   last recession realizing they don't need to hire as the economy comes
   back?
   Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee in their 2012 book [7]Race Against
   the Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation,
   Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the
   Economy, argue that computer technology has truly gotten us to the
   point where we need fewer people to perform the task at the middle of
   the economy. The world needs computer scientists and welders, but far
   less people doing mid-level professional work. On the other side,
   Henrik Christensen, a Georgia Tech roboticist, [8]argues that
   technology will continue to produce far more jobs than it displaces.
   My take: It's just too early to tell. The economy could completely turn
   around and near full employment. Or we can see a permanent loss in
   returning jobs. History doesn't seem like a good guide here.
   There are so many issues tied to the current state of employment and
   this sense of technological efficiency replacing jobs: Is college
   really worth the cost? Should an undergraduate student major in a STEM
   field or follow their passion if it lies elsewhere? Do we need MOOCs to
   improve access to quality education and/or keep down education costs?
   Are academics the next group to meet the efficiency maker?
   My oldest daughter starts college next year and I don't even know what
   advice to give her.

       "History doesn't seem like a good guide here."
       It also doesn't seem like a good thing in which to major if you
       want a career when you graduate, yet students do. The role of
       college used to be to provide some skills for all but also a
       well-rounded education to expand ones mind. When did the lie begin
       that it was required for so many jobs? As more jobs need more
       specific skills, taking a major that you enjoy for the sake of
       becoming a well-rounded and interesting person appears less and
       less wise for most. If someone from a generally middle-class home
       wants to go to a college that costs $40k a year and study Classics,
       I think that person is making a giant mistake. If they want to go
       to a college that costs $4k a year and do the same thing, knowing
       that it's not going to help much to get a great job, at least they
       are going in with eyes open and expanding their mind at a
       reasonable cost.

       1) WHENEVER technology leads to job loss and then job gain, there
       will
       be people tossed out of work who don't get better jobs later.
       (One aspect of Creative Destructive)
       2) What jobs WON"T go away? My guess is truck drivers (though lance
       thinks
       Trucks will drive themelves in 15 years), Nurses, maybe Doctors,
       Service
       jobs (will waiters be replaced by robots), and of course the worlds
       oldest
       profession- FARMING. And the second oldest as well.
       3) Its easy for me to say `tell your daughter to take courses that
       she likes and things will work out', however, its YOUR house she'll
       move back into if she can't find a job, not mine. Even so, its
       usually good advice
       with the caveat of having SOME awareness of the job market.
       4) Tell her to work on P vs NP so that the 1,000,000 will set her
       for life.
       (High risk, High reward)

       From your reasoning, it is probably easy to give advice to your
       daughter: if she has no interests in being a welder, then she has
       to follow your steps:)

       Bill: FARMING?! That's a profession that is among the most hard-hit
       by technology. Of course it won't go away completely, but in
       developed countries it is a tiny fraction of employment: e.g.
       [31]From more than 50% of population down to below 4% in the U.S.

       Choosing what major you would follow is a life decision. One should
       not base it on the predictions of some guy (except if he has the
       Urbana algorithm at hand).
       It also depends on the risks you are willing to take. I always
       wanted to be a researcher but I knew that in my country, research
       is not supported and that I would have to migrate to another
       country. I knew that risk and I gladly took it.
       I also believe that it works different for different people. For
       example, researcher seems like the only job in the world that I
       would be able to do for life and not get bored of. For others, it
       might be that they wouldn't stand 5 minutes of that job and find
       jobs extremely exciting that I find terribly boring.
       Finally, as the issue of technology vs employment, I believe that
       technology should always win, given that it will improve the
       quality of life for everyone, including future generations. The
       classical example for this would be the printing press or the
       industrialization of the 18th and 19th century. Sure, many at that
       time might have been put in a difficult place, but even if we
       disregard the boost in new jobs, the quality of life for future
       generations greatly improved.

       Advice on what undergraduate students should do:
       1. Play the opening like it's an opening. You will not checkmate in
       one move, nor will you establish a financially or personally
       successful life in your first year of college --- even by saying
       the magic words, "I will major in ---," or "I will go to medical
       school." What you can do is establish a good board position, set up
       things that could turn into unforeseen opportunities later, and
       maybe get the feel of the game a little.
       2. Do not try to time the market. People who can tell you
       tomorrow's values of a financial security are charlatans. So are
       the people who can tell you what the employment market will look
       like in four years --- much less twenty. Of course, the
       fundamentals can tell you something: Is there a business model
       (respectively, a career model) there? Is the company/field of study
       a long-term player in an active market, a fad, or a perennial loser
       in a market it keeps promising is right around the corner?
       3. Remember that life is big. It's an unhealthy person who has only
       one interest; even only one interest that they pursue seriously. I
       know a lawyer who is deeply involved in the world of the arts
       (though not professionally), a radiologist who is a major player in
       local politics, and a middle school math teacher who can fix
       anything. It's nice to love the thing you make money at. But you
       can and should love love --- and commit deeply to --- other things,
       as well.
       4. Consider the end. Never make any academic decision (like
       enrolling in a particular class) on less than a four year time
       horizon. Never make any serious life decision (like a college
       major) on a shorter time horizon than your life expectancy. There
       will be uncertainties, but make at least a tentative plan about how
       what you're doing will be good for you over that time span.

       Without myself knowing at all the answers(s) to any of Lance's
       questions, please let me say that they are terrific questions to
       ask ... especially because a Chair of Engineering is legitimizing
       them by asking them.
       My BibTeX file provides the following advice, written in 1813, from
       a then-elderly [44]Sir Joseph Banks (president of the Royal
       Society) to a young friend:
       --------------------
       Letter to William Hooker, June 19, 1813
       Let me hear from you how you feel included to prefer Ease &
       indulgence to Hardship and activity. I was about 23 when I began my
       peregrinations. You are somewhat older but you may be assured that
       if I had Listend to a multitude of voices that were Raised up to
       dissuade me from my Enterprise I should now have been a Quiet
       countrey Gentleman ignorant of a number of matters I am now
       acquainted with & probably have attained to no higher Rank in Life
       than that of a countrey Justice of the Peace.
       adieu my dear Sir
          Very Faithfully yours
             Jos: Banks
       --------------------
       Good luck to all young people, in their peregrinations!

       I think the current employment situation has more to do with money
       than technology. Many people accumulated a lot of debt, and are
       trying to pay down that debt quickly. Money that would be spent on
       investments or hiring is being spent on paying down debt or
       building a cash reserve. If you look at total debt,
       government+private sector, it's going down quite fast. There's
       little evidence that people are unemployed because of technology.
       Going to college seems like a no brainer to me. I suppose it could
       be delayed if there was some sort of short term opportunity that
       was simply too big to pass up, but getting a degree is important.
       Not only are jobs that require a post-high school education
       typically more interesting, pay is higher on average, and
       unemployment among college graduates is much lower:

       ege-the-unemployment-rate-for-bachelors-degree-holders-is-37-percen
       t/272779/
       On what to study, I don't know. I've met people who avoid STEM
       fields because they think it is too hard or they aren't good at
       math. I think that's a terrible mistake, and everybody should get
       at least some serious ungrad-level science coursework. However, if
       you are passionate about something else, go for it.
