   [48]Yahoo has launched a complete redesign of its dated [49]My Yahoo.

   It's been more than six years since the company touched My Yahoo, the
   homepage customization concept, but it's timing for a new look couldn't
   be more perfect: Google announced last year it's [50]pulling the plug
   on similar service iGoogle, so loyal users may be looking for a new
   place to go come November.

   This is the latest of many redesign efforts we've seen from Yahoo this
   year, joining the overhaul of its homepage, [52]its photo-sharing site
   Flickr and most recently, [53]the logo. Under the direction of CEO
   Marissa Mayer, the move is part of an effort to make the
   once-struggling company more relevant and modern.

   YahooDesign

   For those unfamiliar with the feature, My Yahoo acts as a portal to
   things you're interested in accessing online, from email accounts and
   calendars to stocks, sports scores, weather and content from around the
   web such as recipes and news articles.

   "We have a loyal, existing user base of people who use My Yahoo every
   day, and we think there is a way to really grow the platform," Mike
   Kerns, senior VP of homepage and vertical products, told Mashable.
   "When we launched a new homepage design in February, we learned that
   every feature might not be for everyone and wanted to give more options
   to personalize their experience."

   At first glance, you'll notice the new My Yahoo is much more
   streamlined and organized. You can customize the content you want, by
   dragging and dropping columns and modules across the page. It's also
   very fast and responsive.

   Another new touch is the introduction of themes from designers such as
   Rachel Zoe to bands such as Fun. and One Direction. This allows users
   to give a personalized feel to their homepage, rather than Yahoo's
   standard page.

   My Yahoo

   Kerns said the company placed a big emphasis on making My Yahoo
   optimized for mobile too, so users can get customized content on the
   go.

   "My Yahoo hasn't kept up with the times, and we wanted to make it much
   more accessible on mobile, so you can get everything you want by
   accessing one main page and make that a part of a daily habit," he
   added.

   Yahoo makes it simple for iGoogle users to import their preferences;
   after making the transfer, the company will build a personalized My
   Yahoo page for you.

   "Google announced it is shutting down iGoogle in November and we
   thought this could be an opportunity to bring over users who are still
   looking for a rich customized experience," Kerns said. "We're trying to
   make the switch easy for everyone."
