   Microsoft and Nokia: Looking Back to the Past to Own The Future
   Over on Shadow Trends this month I take a look at the Microsoft/Nokia
   merger and consider both companies' slides and how these slides
   corresponded with the firms' loss of focus on the people. The
   reorganizations at both companies coupled with the merger should remove
   the distractions that have plagued both firms and we already are seeing
   a sharp improvement in marketing and devices like the Nokia Lumia 1020.
   The success for the combined entity will be tied to how well it can now
   focus back on the user and, structurally, that should be far easier
   now. Full column in Shadow Trends on TCMnet this month:
