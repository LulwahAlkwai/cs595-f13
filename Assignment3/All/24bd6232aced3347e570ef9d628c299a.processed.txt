   Star Trek May Be Coming Back To TV and it is faithful to the original
   series. Netflix, are you listenting?
   With Crowd Sourced funding it appears some of the old Star Trek actors
   have launched a pilot which could bring a show faithful to the old
   series back to TV. For us old farts this could be incredibly cool
   because the time period is well after Voyager and would be time
   consistent with ages of the actors. It is still fun to watch the old
   series and such a shame that Enterprise went sideways and lost its way,
   though there was a moment when I actually thought the Nazis with Alien
   collaborators in the alternative past stuff was kind of cool at the end
   of that one. Watch the background on Indiegogo:

   so pick this up)
