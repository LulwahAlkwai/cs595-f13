About Rationally Speaking

   Rationally Speaking is a blog maintained by Prof. Massimo Pigliucci, a
   philosopher at the City University of New York. The blog reflects the
   Enlightenment figure Marquis de Condorcet's idea of what a public
   intellectual (yes, we know, that's such a bad word) ought to be:
   someone who devotes himself to "the tracking down of prejudices in the
   hiding places where priests, the schools, the government, and all
   long-established institutions had gathered and protected them." You're

Neuro-backlash? What backlash?

   by Sally Satel and Scott O. Lilienfeld
   [This is a guest post by Sally Satel and Scott O. Lilienfeld. Sally is
   a psychiatrist, and Scott a psychologist. They are the authors of
   [11]Brainwashed - The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience (Basic
   Books, 2013). They have recently been interviewed for a forthcoming
   episode of the [12]Rationally Speaking podcast.]
   This summer, a popular neuroscience blogger established a new site
   called neurocomplimenter.blogspot.com. "I'm starting a backlash against
   the fashionable anti-neuro backlash," he announced. His concern was
   shared by some neuroscientists and commentators who had earlier charged
   New York Times columnist David Brooks, yes that David Brooks, with
   spearheading a backlash against their field.
   Some backstory. In a [13]June column, Brooks had expressed skepticism
   that "understanding the brain is the solution to understanding all
   thought and behavior." He referred to some recent books on the topic,
   ours among them. These books did four things. First, they urged readers
   to be skeptical of definitive conclusions about subtle contents of the
   mind from brain-based data at least within the current state of
   technological development. Second, they cautioned against the premature
   application of brain scans in the courtroom, and other non-research
   venues. Third, they challenged neurocentrism, the assumption that human
   experience and behavior are best explained from the predominant, let
   alone exclusive, perspective of the brain, at the expense of
   psychological or social perspectives. And, fourth, the books affirmed
   the value of neuroscientific inquiry while seeking to preserve its
   credibility in the public's eye by pushing back against these excesses.
   As for Brooks, he concluded his column stating: "The brain is not the
   mind." Reaction was swift. Brooks was castigated as a "[14]neuroscience
   hater," and was said to have "[15]call[ed] neuroscience pointless,"
   "[16]lash[ed] out" at the field, and launched a "[17]general
   condemnation of neuroscience." Worse, Brooks was excoriated for
   allegedly [18]endorsing dualism, the long-discredited notion that the
   mind and the brain are independent of each other and composed of
   different physical substances with consciousness existing in a
   spiritual world separate from the body.
   To some extent, this reflexive response is understandable. Any
   critique, no matter how measured or how circumscribed, can always be
   abused by one's enemies to discredit an entire enterprise. And, Brooks,
   a political columnist, may not have parsed technical terms as precisely
   as an expert would have. Still, if there is a shadowy "anti-neuro"
   lobby looking to twist legitimate scrutiny into a wholesale
   denunciation, it must be pretty ineffectual. Indeed, the brain is
   riding high: [19]stunning [20]new [21]discoveries are pouring out of
   labs; the Obama BRAIN initiative is well under way; university
   neuroscience programs are thriving; academically serious disciplines
   such as neurolaw and neuroeconomics are part of many graduate school
   curricula; and popular-science books about the brain are flying out of
   publishing houses.
   So, we don't see any neuroscience backlash threatening to toss out the
   neuroscientific baby with the brain-water. And we're glad about that.
   What we do see, however, is value in examining the language people use
   when talking about the relationship between the brain and the mind.
   Let's begin with the proposition, suggested by Brooks, that the brain
   and the mind are "different." Does this necessarily mean that the two
   are materially separate domains? Virtually all psychologists,
   psychiatrists, and neuroscientists, ourselves included, certainly don't
   think so. Every subjective experience, from the ache of nostalgia to
   the frisson of a Christmas morning, corresponds to physical events in
   the brain. The mind - the realm of feelings, desires, ideas, memories,
   intentions, and subjective experience - is produced by the action of
   neurons and brain circuits. How else could it work? Yet, as Brooks
   observed, the mind is not identical with the matter that produces it.
   So, to say that the brain and the mind are different is not necessarily
   evidence of scientific ignorance. It means simply that one cannot use
   the physical rules from the cellular level to completely predict
   activity at the psychological or behavioral level.
   As an analogy, consider the words Shakespeare wrote on a page. They
   are, of course, "material," but one could not capture the meaning of
   his plays by conducting a chemical analysis of the ink in which the
   letters of his words were written. The brain and the mind are different
   levels of explanation of the same phenomenon; when we talk about the
   brain, we talk about mechanism underlying perception, emotion, and
   cognition; when we talk about mind, we talk about awareness and
   meaning. Because brain and mind are different levels of description,
   they have different properties. This position, which we endorse, is
   called property dualism.
   Similarly, one cannot rely on the brain alone to predict or understand
   everything important about human subjectivity or behavior. This is
   because many psychological phenomena are emergent properties of
   lower-order constituents such as neural circuits, neurons, proteins,
   and genes. "Constitutive" reductionism - reducing complex entities to
   the sum of their component parts to facilitate study - is not
   controversial in the scientific community. But, radical or
   "eliminative" reductionists go a crucial, and questionable, step
   further. They insist that everything mental will ultimately be
   explained fully at the material level of analysis. This variant of
   reductionism ultimately eliminates the need for the psychological level
   of analysis, not to mention all other levels - social, cultural, and so
   on.
   In his 2006 book, An Argument for Mind, Harvard University psychologist
   Jerome Kagan notes that the appreciation of an impressionistic painting
   requires far more than the sum of its parts. [1] "As a viewer slowly
   approaches Claude Monet's painting of the Seine at Dawn there comes a
   moment when the scene dissolves into tiny patches of color." When we
   adopt the eliminative reductionist position, Kagan states, "the
   coherent psychological component vanishes."
   Some philosophers of mind take a different view. They speculate that
   such properties (the painting in full) will ultimately prove reducible
   to more basic elements (the paint). They may prove correct. But for the
   foreseeable future, valuable information is often lost when descending
   from higher explanatory levels, such as mental states, to lower levels,
   such as neuronal systems.
   The distinctions between substance and property dualism and between
   constitutive and greedy reductionism may appear arcane, but overlooking
   them can lead us to overestimate the explanatory power of
   neuroscientific findings. Take addiction, for example. The dominant
   view among researchers is that it is a "brain disease," plain and
   simple. Without a doubt, chronic drug exposure often changes the brain,
   but knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying addiction typically
   has less relevance to the treatment of drug addiction and alcoholism
   than the psychological and social causes. To be sure, intervening
   directly on the brain, say with medications such as methadone, can
   sometimes be of value too. But understanding the brain of addicts gives
   us only partial insight into why they become addicted and how they
   recover.
   A similar point holds for clinical depression. Although depression is
   clearly influenced by biological factors, including a genetic
   predisposition, this does not mean, contrary to common assumptions,
   that it is necessarily best treated by medication. In fact, certain
   psychological treatments, especially cognitive-behavioral and
   interpersonal psychotherapies, appear to be at least as effective as
   medications for depression while having no known physical side effects
   and showing superior prevention of future episodes.
   As for a neuroscience "backlash," well, we just don't see it.
   Distinguishing brain from mind, or criticizing the excesses of brain
   imaging, is hardly a repudiation of the great insight of human
   neuroscience: that our mental lives arise from brain activity. Both
   levels, the brain and the mind, are essential to a complete description
   of human experience and behavior. Psychology and neuroscience can test
   theories that explain and forecast human behavior - and someday, we
   will know much more about how they are integrated.
   For now - and for the foreseeable future - we mustn't lose the mind in
   the age of brain science. Like the Seine at Dawn, if we get too close
   to the elements of a grand tableau, we will miss the coherent picture.

       My first gut reactions to this piece is that, one, you're using the
       term property dualism inappropriately and two you're overstating
       the problems with reductionism. In other words I don't think there
       is any need to introduce a word as terrifying as dualism in our
       vernacular just to emphasise the importance of appropriate levels
       of description.

            What the authors are calling "property dualism" seems to
            conform to what Howard Robinson, in the article "[37]Dualism"
            in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, calls "predicate
            dualism." "One might say that [according to predicate dualism]
            we need more than the language of physics to describe and
            explain the weather, but we do not need more than its
            ontology. . . . [By contrast,] Genuine property dualism occurs
            when, even at the individual level, the ontology of physics is
            not sufficient to constitute what is there. The irreducible
            language is not just another way of describing what there is,
            it requires that there be something more there than was
            allowed for in the initial ontology."
            However, (1) Robinson's distinction rests on the presumption
            that the word "property" has some genuine ontological import,
            rather than being merely the material-mode equivalent of
            "predicate." The authors seem to presume the contrary
            position, that a supposedly ontological difference in
            properties is just the shadow of a logical difference in
            predicates: "Because brain and mind are different levels of
            description, they have different properties." (2) Even under
            Robinson's scheme, the authors' position still falls under the
            term "dualism." And (3) all of these scholastic refinements of
            terminology are immaterial to the main point, which is that a
            rejection of the most ambitious claims of neuroscience does
            not presume "that 'the mind' is something ineffable, ethereal,
            and immaterial," as Paul Waldman says in [38]the piece cited
            by the authors.

            Miles,
            Re your (2): What's in a name? The fact that predicate
            dualists give themselves that name doesn't necessarily mean
            that this is a form of dualism in a helpful sense. I think
            that predicate dualism (as the SEP describes it) is so
            different from traditional dualism that it's misleading to put
            them together in one category.
            Of course, we could just ignore the fact that the authors
            called their position "property dualism", and say that it
            doesn't matter what they call it. But since the issue of
            dualism (in the more traditional sense) is already in play
            (and mentioned earlier in the OP), their use of the same term
            in an (arguably) different sense is confusing.
            It's also possible that these terms carry baggage which is not
            explicitly stated by their proponents. The linked Guardian
            article makes the point that, even if we call ourselves
            materialists, we may still think like dualists (and I assume
            the author means "dualist" in the traditional sense). Perhaps
            predicate and property dualists carry more traditional
            dualistic baggage than they realise. I note that the OP also
            uses the word "emergent", which to me is another red-flag
            word. It can be used in a harmless ("weak") sense, but to me
            the term usually seems to carry a kind of baggage verging on
            the dualistic. I think it's best avoided altogether.
            I agree with your (3), but much of philosophical error and
            disagreement turns on problems of terminology, so such
            problems deserve our careful attention. Much of the argument
            over neuroscientific excess seems to depend on whether authors
            agree with crude statements like "The mind is the brain". If
            they could see that there's no one right answer to such
            questions (it depends what you mean), then the camps might be
            less polarised.

       Good article. An appropriately nuanced view. (Though conceding
       property dualism has bigger metaphysical implications than is let
       on here.)
       Either conscious states are irreducibly causally efficacious or
       they are an epiphenomeon, and are therefore causally inert. There
       is no real middle ground.
       Of course, the idea that consciousness is epiphenomenal is ugly and
       stupid.

            Off topic but couldn't resist:
            "Either conscious states are irreducibly causally efficacious
            or they are an epiphenomenon, and are therefore causally
            inert. There is no real middle ground."
            Not sure about that. Conscious states - conscious experiences
            like pain - are causally efficacious and thus not
            epiphenomenal from a subjective standpoint (I grimace
            *because* I feel pain) even though they don't figure in third
            person accounts of behavior since they aren't observable (you
            can't see my pain, only its neural correlates). From a third
            person perspective something is epiphenomenal only if it's
            part of an observed system but doesn't play a causal role in
            the system's operation (e.g., Huxley's whistle on the steam
            locomotive). Since conscious experience doesn't appear from a
            third person perspective on the brain and behavior, it isn't
            part of the observed system and so isn't in a position to be
            epiphenomenal.

            Interesting point, Tom. I think that your observation amounts
            to this, that from a third-person perspective, conscious
            states are not epiphenomena because they are not, properly
            speaking, phenomena at all. A phenomenon is an observable
            occurrence, and conscious states cannot be observed. Other
            people, obviously, cannot observe my conscious states, but
            only what goes on in my body; but also (though less
            obviously), I cannot observe my own conscious states, but can
            only have them. So the contrast between conscious states and
            neural states is not a contrast between two kinds of phenomena
            but between a first-person (perhaps also second-person)
            perspective and a third-person perspective. That's an
            irreducible distinction, but of grammar, not of ontology.

            Miles, I've long suspected that part of the confusion over
            consciousness arises from people reifying first-person
            experience, treating it as a phenomenon. But I still feel
            quite confused about the whole subject.

            Richard, I was a bit sly in using the word "grammar" in my
            last sentence. I intended my statement to be defensible on a
            common understanding of the word "grammar." So understood,
            saying that the contrast between first-person and third-person
            perspectives is a difference of grammar and not of ontology
            suggests a disparagement of the issue about mind and body. But
            for my own private purposes I had in mind the Wittgensteinian
            sense, in which grammar is something that can be investigated
            for as long as it gives rise to conceptual perplexities, which
            is to say, potentially endlessly.

       "... [T]he mind is not identical with the matter that produces it.
       So, to say that the brain and the mind are different is not
       necessarily evidence of scientific ignorance. It means simply that
       one cannot use the physical rules from the cellular level to
       completely predict activity at the psychological or behavioral
       level."
       The authors seem to be implicitly suggesting that the
       neuroscientific view sees the brain in isolation.
       This is the key point surely (only obscured by talk of dualism and
       'the mind'): that the brain would not function as a normal brain
       (generating social responses, speech, etc.) were the body of which
       it is a part not in a particular kind of physical environment -
       namely one involving a whole bunch of other bodies interacting
       socially.
       If the brain is seen in its broader physical context, and we accept
       the (obvious) need for different levels of description, then, as
       Louis Burke suggests, I think we can do without talk of dualism.
       Whereas ordinary, casual uses of the word 'mind', and idioms like
       'make up your mind', are obviously fine and quite harmless, serious
       talk of 'the mind' does tend to encourage dualistic ways of
       thinking in my view.
       (And who is talking about 'completely predicting', by the way?)

       "knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying addiction typically
       has less relevance to the treatment of drug addiction and
       alcoholism than the psychological and social causes"
       "In fact, certain psychological treatments, especially
       cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal psychotherapies, appear to
       be at least as effective as medications for depression"
       It's telling that in both of these examples, the overall efficacy
       of our treatments is not very good. Questions about what exact type
       of dualism or reductionism is being espoused are only useful
       insofar as they inform an eventual model of human behavior. Almost
       everyone agrees that this model will contain descriptions at
       multiple levels of organization.
       The practical question has to do with what lines of research we
       follow to get to a decent model -- something we are nowhere close
       to having. Are we really at risk, at this point, of discarding
       research at the higher levels of organization? Or is the excitement
       surrounding research at lower levels a reasonable reaction to
       hitting a vein of research methods that will hopefully improve our
       descriptions at all levels?
       Yeah, it annoys me to hear overconfident and exclusionary
       predictions about neuroscience research. But it's the results, not
       the predictions, that will end up mattering. And it's worth
       remembering that the results we're getting from our current
       high-level approaches are nowhere near good enough.

       Meanwhile, the neuro-hype continues to come out:
       "[108]Researchers discover source of imagination in human brain"
       (Lance Tillson, The National Monitor, September 17, 2013):
       >>According to a news release from Dartmouth College, researchers
       have discovered the source of imagination in the human brain. Their
       research answers several longstanding scientific questions: what
       gives people the ability to make beautiful art, construct novel
       tools and achieve other extremely distinct actions. . . .
       >>"Our findings move us closer to understanding how the
       organization of our brains sets us apart from other species and
       provides such a rich internal playground for us to think freely and
       creatively," notes lead author Alex Schlegel, a graduate student in
       the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth
       College, in a statement. "Understanding these differences will give
       us insight into where human creativity comes from and possibly
       allow us to recreate those same creative processes in machines."<<
       Such statements conflate conceptual questions about what
       imagination and creativity are and how they work with empirical
       questions about what mechanism in the brain makes it possible for
       human beings to have imagination and creativity. The research bears
       on the latter sort of question, but it is touted as if it bore on
       questions of the first sort.

            Yes, one would have to do that to be fair to the authors. My
            point was just that neuroscience was being puffed, no matter
            who was doing the puffing. I deliberately chose this piece of
            reportage rather than the press release that it cited (which I
            looked up through a link in the former) for my quotation
            because the article represented the findings of the study in a
            more inflated fashion than did the press release.

       I've said this before, but I think the Computational Theory of Mind
       (which I view to be not only consistent with naturalism but
       necessarily true in a naturalistic framework) leads to dualism of a
       kind.
       There is more than one form of dualism, and not all of them are
       superstitious. Dualism should not be a dirty word, and my kind of
       dualism has more in common with mathematical Platonism than it does
       with Descartes.
       More on why I think dualism is both consistent with naturalism and
       entirely reasonable on my blog:

       By the way, my earlier comment was not a criticism of the article,
       which I think was good! However, I do see the mind as more than
       just a different level of description than the brain. I see it as a
       mathematical structure which could in principle be implemented on a
       different substrate while remaining essentially the same mind
       (hence, mind uploading while probably practically infeasible is not
       incoherent a priori).

       Brooks takes a right wing dualist perspective because neuroscience
       can be used in areas like media advertising and other marketing
       techniques. We may talk in dualisms, reductions, epiphenoma and
       emergence but neuroscience has little to say why "mind" sees the
       world as such.
       Why do we make a possible category error as seeing consciousness as
       an individual trait when consciousness produces the train whistle
       of language and culture which are social traits?

       Thanks for the note on reductionist "brain disease" approaches to
       addiction. Jeff Sheff's new book "Clean" certainly appears guilty,
       though not necessarily fully embracing all of Pop Neuroscience. He
       rightly points out what's wrong with 12-step approaches to
       addiction support.
       However, he has two failures after this.
       The first is not to say ONE WORD about alternatives to AA/NA, like
       Lifering, SMART or SOS. Not one word.
       The second is to, per your comments, proceed to looking at drugs
       that can (but not always) reduce cravings for alcohol, or opiates,
       and from there hope for the holy grail -- an addiction vaccine. The
       man is on some level so ignorant of the real, complex nature of
       addiction, despite his son's addiction that led to his first book,
       it's scary.
       That said, Pop Neuroscience reflects the typical American love with
       what I call salvific technologism on my blog, that is, the idea
       that the cavalry of a technological fix are just over the hill.
       Surely Pop Neuroscience will, via better fMRIs, point the way to
       laser-guided quasi-lobotomies for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia
       and more!

       The ink vs Shakespeare analogy doesn't work. You can talk about the
       characters in a play without referring to the language it is
       written in, but you can also say something about the content of the
       play in terms of clusters of consonants or word counts. However,
       you cannot say anything meaningful about a play in relation to the
       ink it was printed with. The play is not at all the ink, but it is
       an instance of the language of which it is composed.
