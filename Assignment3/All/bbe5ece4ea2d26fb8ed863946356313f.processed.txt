[4]Why I never give straight answers

   There are some questions that you should never answer. This is true
   when you are facing justice, your angry wife, or students.

   Carl Zimmer, a famous science writer, [5]complains about how students
   keep asking him homework questions. There is no doubt some degree of
   intellectual laziness mixed with a lack of respect. But I believe that
   the lazy questions are actually a sign that schools are failing
   students.

   Back when I attended college, you better had an appointment if you
   expected to see a professor outside of class. And chances are that the
   professor would miss your appointment. I once waited outside the office
   of a professor for an hour while I had dirty chat with his mistress.
   And if you ever got a professor cornered, you better be prepared! If
   you came to a professor unprepared, with lazy questions, he would
   dismiss you without a second look. Sending an email to a professor was
   unthinkable: it would surely go unanswered unless he was your thesis
   supervisor. (These professors should not be commended for their
   behaviour, of course.)

   And yet, experts were far more precious than they are today. There was
   just no possibility of getting the answers through the Internet. With
   some luck, you could get a decent textbook at the library, and you had
   to figure things out by yourself.

   Today, students have 10 or 100 times the ressources I had as a college
   student. Yet hardly any of them have learned to use these ressources.
   Instead, they email experts and hope for the best.

   When I started teaching shortly after graduating, I thought that
   whenever I got a question by a student, I should answer it as clearly
   and directly as possible. And so I did. Until I started teaching
   advanced students, until I started supervising graduate students... and
   I realized that a whole lot of them were basically damaged. They simply
   could not figure things out on their own. They could not make any
   judgement call. They couldn't find the right answer by first trying 100
   wrong answers.

   If I solved a problem in front of them, they could take notes and
   reproduce my solution. But they often wouldn't even try coming up with
   an original solution of their own. They certainly would never look
   critically at the solution I provided.

   I realized that we were "over-schooling" the students. Given today's
   technology, we need to give fewer answers to the students, not more.
   Though this may sound ironic, I think that students should spend less
   time in a classroom today than they did in the industrial era.

   It is maybe no wonder that employers are not eager to hire college
   graduates. Beside the bad economy, there might be the very real concern
   that graduates are ill-prepared to deal with the real world as it is in
   2013.

   Whenever my kids ask me a question, I almost always ask them back "what
   do you think?" And then I listen carefully. Often I will ask more
   questions. Similarly, to teach them something, I often simply ask a
   question. For example, last week-end, I asked my two boys whether
   automated teller machines were robots. They agreed that they were
   robots. Then one of them added "but they lack wheels to move around".
   And then I asked "but they are still robots?" And they both said "yes,
   sure". We then launched into a short debate about what a robot is.

   I try to follow the same process with my students, including my
   graduate students. I don't always have the patience. It takes less time
   and it is more gratifying to simply give the shortest possible answer.
   But I still try to answer first by a question so that the student is
   forced to think a little bit about the question. I estimate that 80% of
   the time, the student ends up answering his own question. I am sure
   that most students find that I have a bad attitude ("why won't he just
   give me a straight answer?"), but I am also sure that they also feel
   proud to have figured it out on their own. And that is what I am
   ultimately trying to show: you can figure most things out on your own,
   given a little bit of help.

    1. Well, I do agree your viewpoints. However, I think the root cause
       of the problem is NOT the students themselves. In fact, the
       nowadays education systems and teachers are the producers. "It is
       rather to teach a person how to fish than just give him a fish!!"
       How many teachers wish to spend tons of time to guide their
       students through every single step to solve a problem? Particularly
       under those exam-oriented education systems. And please remember,
       not everybody is a genius. The most important responsibility of a
       teacher is to "Teach".

       I don't think teachers should be there through every single step.
       It would be entirely counterproductive. You can, however, give
       examples.

    3. I agree with you wholeheartedly. I teach most effectively to people
       who learn like I do, which is to figure things out having been
       pointed in the right general direction. But as an occasional
       adjunct professor, I have had to learn to teach students who learn
       by watching me do the work at least once. But in both cases, my
       goal is not to make them learn the material (only they can learn it
       themselves, I can't "make" them do anything) but to help them to
       learn how they learn best. That is the only non-perishable thing a
       teacher can actually develop in a student.

    4. I completely agree with you. I think you just have rediscovered the
       Socratic method. Best

    5. As a TA, I had a defensive pose which was generally to lead the
       student to the solution, but they have to do the stepping. Oh, and
       giving up is not allowed. You WILL leave this office KNOWING how
       the answer is derived.
       After their first try, not a whole lot of them showed up again, and
       those who did, were a pleasure to work with. They wanted to KNOW.

    6. Asking to see a student's code, or a sketch of a data structure, is
       another effective approach. Then I can ask them to explain it to
       me. Sometimes, the explanation jiggles their brain enough that they
       see the answer they need. Other times, we find out something they
       really don't understand.

       If it is a programming assignment, I would definitively be tempted
       to ask to see the source code. And, indeed, it might be enough to
       get the student going.

    8. You are so right on this one, I can`t agree more. We've became so
       good at explaining, that students don`t need to know how to learn
       anymore.
