   First Major Android Trojan Botnet Starts to Spread Broadly
   Making mobile AV vendors happy everyplace the first evidence of a
   highly successful Android Trojan has started to spread broadly
   infecting large numbers of phones. This certainly suggests people
   shouldn't be clicking on SMS messages asking you to click on something
   even though the message appears and likely does actually come from
   someone you know and trust (because once it infects a phone it takes
   the phone over and uses the contacts in the phone to infect other
   phones). The infection spike is pretty impressive and mirrors a similar
   attack method to that successfully used historically on Windows.
   Ironically this attack method shouldn't work on either iOS or Windows
   phones because of the hard lock to the related app store (you have to
   be able to side load for it to work). ZDNet article here:
