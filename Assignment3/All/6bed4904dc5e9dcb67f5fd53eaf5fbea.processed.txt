Is There a U.S. IT Worker Shortage?

   Someone who is a data scientist today is said by Harvard Business
   Review to have the [25]sexiest job alive. And if sexy isn't enough, how
   about being a savior of the economy?  According to a 2011 report by
   consulting company McKinsey & Company, "Big Data" is "[26]the next
   frontier for innovation, competition and productivity." That is, of
   course, if enough of those sexy data scientists can be found.

   For also according to McKinsey's report, "the United States alone could
   face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical
   skills as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how
   to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions," by 2018.

   However, Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president at Gartner and global
   head of research asserts that the shortage [27]situation is even more
   frightening than what McKinsey implies. Sondergaard stated in October
   2012 that, "By 2015, 4.4 million IT jobs globally will be created to
   support Big Data, generating 1.9 million IT jobs in the United States.
   In addition, every big data-related role in the U.S. will create
   employment for three people outside of IT, so over the next four years
   a total of 6 million jobs in the U.S. will be generated by the
   information economy."

   Wow. Not only will Big Data make a significant dent in the U.S.
   unemployment rate, but the U.S. IT technical workforce of 3.9 million
   or so needs to increase by almost 50 percent within the next two years.

   But wait, there's more.

   sensors icon According to a [28]2012 IDC study (pdf) commissioned by
   Microsoft, cloud computing ([29]which made storage sexy) is going to
   require 2.7 million cloud-related IT specialists in the U.S. and Canada
   by 2015 as well.

   And as icing on the IT worker short(age) cake, the U.S. government's
   $30 billion [30]electronic health record (EHR) initiative has
   apparently created an even greater shortage of health information
   technology workers over the next few years, above the 50 0000 the U.S.
   government estimated, according to a [31]report earlier this year by
   the consulting company Price-Water House Coopers. Unfortunately, I
   can't find anyone who says these HIT jobs are sexy, so they may go
   wanting.

   Given the intense competition for IT workers these thee shortage
   projections imply (and this doesn't include the recent claims that
   [32]corporate IT spending will take off from 2014 to 2016 which should
   increase IT worker demand at least some), one would expect a huge,
   surging corporate and IT industry demand for IT professionals across
   the board, with job position listings, salaries and perks soaring as
   [33]they did during the late 1990s Dot.com boom. I would also expect
   government to publish worrisome studies about the issue, like the U.S.
   Department of Commerce did in 1997, under the title of [34]America's
   New Deficit: The Shortage of Information Technology Workers (pdf).

   I would also expect those [35]100 high tech executives wanting an
   increase in the number of H-1B visas issued would be baying for the
   limit to be raised to 500 000 or more instead of a measly 115 000. And
   why aren't these executives saying they have tens of thousands of open
   big data, cloud computing and HIT positions, instead of a paltry 10 000
   being used as justification for more H-1B visas?

   But strangely enough, recent [36]salary and anecdotal data doesn't show
   this happening. Nor are tech companies like [37]Cisco, IBM or HP (some
   of the ones which are the ones begging for more H-1B visas) rescinding
   their decisions to lay off thousands of IT workers. And those laid off
   IT workers don't seem to be sucked into some huge Big Data-Cloud-HIT
   worker shortage whirlpool that should be growing by the day out there
   somewhere.

   Perhaps Cisco, IBM and HP among others have discovered that perhaps
   these predictions are more fiction than reality. Even [38]Gartner has
   recently admitted that Big Data may be a wee bit overhyped.  Or maybe,
   in the words of a recent New York Times [39]article, Big Data is really
   just a Big (unsexy) Dud, and no one wants to admit it.

   We've been here before, some 15 years ago, during the [40]great
   computer programmer shortage scare. Projections at the time said that
   by 2008, the [41]U.S. would need 839 000 computer programmers (pdf) by
   2008. The actual [42]number computer programmers actually employed was
   in 2008 closer to 427 000, due in part to outsourcing.

   And speaking of outsourcing, an [43]article in CIO magazine last week
   reports that a study by [44]The Hackett Group says that since 2002,
   offshoring, new technology productivity improvements, and low business
   growth will have "killed" 1.5 million IT jobs across North America and
   Europe by 2017 after new job creation is factored in. The losses were
   roughly the same for both continents. Perhaps The Hackett Group hasn't
   heard about the Big Data-Cloud-HIT worker shortage either?

   Even out in Silicon Valley, which is begging for more H-1B guestworkers
   because of a shortage of engineering and IT talent, all is not what it
   seems. As described in a recent New York Times article, the San
   Francisco talent search company Bright found that after examining three
   million of its résumés of job seekers in the United States, there are
   "[45]plenty of potential candidates [who] exist for thousands of
   positions for which companies want to import guest workers."

   Steve Goodman, Bright's CEO, was quoted by the Times as saying, "I
   didn't expect this result."

   The[46] Bright report (pdf) shows only a couple of jobs such as
   application developers or specialized computer occupations where hiring
   H-1B guestworkers might possibly be appropriate. However, in the other
   job categories where shortages are being claimed by high tech
   companies, qualified U.S. job seekers who could do the job already
   exist.

   Goodman, whose company, the Times says, earns its revenue in part by
   placing qualified candidates with recruiters went on to say, "We're
   Silicon Valley people, we just assumed the shortage was true. It turns
   out there is a little Silicon Valley groupthink going on about this,
   though it's not comfortable to say that."

   Without trying to be too cynical, the claims of an impending
   multimillion IT worker shortage in the next 30 months almost make Bill
   Gates look like Nostradamus with his 2004 prediction that, "Two years
   from now, spam will be solved."
