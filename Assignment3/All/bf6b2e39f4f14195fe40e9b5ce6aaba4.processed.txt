End of Moore's Law: It's not just about physics

   A DARPA director argues that the end of the Moore's Law -- which is
   essentially why you now have a tablet in your hand -- could come about
   because of insurmountable economic challenges.

   The end of Moore's Law may ultimately be as much about economics as
   physics, says a DARPA director.

   "My thesis here is that it's time to start planning for the end of
   Moore's Law, and that it's worth pondering how it will end, not just
   when," Robert Colwell, director of the Microsystems Technology Office
   at the [104]Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, told CNET.

   Bob Colwell

   Colwell gave a presentation at the [105]Hot Chips Conference at
   Stanford University on Monday titled "The Chip Design Game at the End
   of Moore's Law." On Tuesday, he provided further comment to CNET.

   "The silicon business is incredibly expensive for folks like Intel, who
   have to pay huge amounts of money to develop the next-generation
   silicon technology," he said.

   How expensive? The [106]new Globalfoundries chip plant in upstate New
   York was a $6 billion undertaking, and the capital expense will rise to
   $8 billion when a new R&D facility is added to it, with that work
   expected to finish up in late 2014.

   Moore's Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, states that the
   number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit
   doubles roughly every two years. For decades, chipmakers have succeeded
   in shrinking chip geometries, allowing Moore's Law to remain on track
   and consumers to get their hands on ever more powerful laptops,
   [107]tablets, and smartphones.

   Below are the comments he provided to CNET based on his speech at the
   Hot Chips conference:

     [It takes] huge amounts to build the fab plants, and yet more...to
     pay for the design teams to design new chips. Intel makes these
     investments, which are in the [billions of dollars], because they
     expect to reap way more [billions of dollars] in profits in the
     following years.

     But if there is doubt that those profits will arrive, and possibly
     if they just doubt they can come up with the necessary silicon
     improvements, they may not want to make the investment at all.
     Should a major player like Intel make such a call, that would
     effectively end Moore's Law all by itself, because then the various
     companies that make the super expensive tools for chip production
     will themselves not make the investments needed to keep Moore's Law
     alive.

   Expanding on the comments above, Colwell said companies need to focus
   on the economics of getting to 7 nanometers and beyond:

     I think most technologists will, at least privately, rationally
     consider the prospects for the end of Moore's Law. But they focus on
     the physics, which change substantially from one silicon process
     technology to the next. These technologists know how monumental the
     challenges are to even get to [7 nanometer] silicon technology, so
     the natural assumption is that eventually some problem with the next
     silicon process technology will turn out to be physically
     insurmountable, and that's what will end Moore's Law.

     They are right, there are very serious challenges looming, but then,
     the silicon industry has beaten back such challenges in the past.
     This gives a lot of people false confidence that we can do it again.
     My attitude is, maybe we can, maybe we can't, but physics isn't the
     only challenge. That was my point in focusing on economics, to
     remind the field that we have to succeed at the physics AND the
     economics or we will have failed, and Moore's Law will have ended.

   Colwell said that for the Defense Department, he uses the year 2020 and
   7 nanometers as the "last process technology node."

   But he adds, "In reality, I expect the industry to do whatever heavy
   lifting is needed to push to 5nm, even if 5nm doesn't offer much
   advantage over 7, and that moves the earliest end to 2022. I think the
   end comes right around those nodes."

   Intel has already begun discussing commercial 10-nanometer technology,
   which is expected to ramp up in 2015.

   But Intel component scientists have also said that it's [108]not clear
   what technology will be used beyond 7 nanometers.

   Currently, Intel processors, such as its Ivy Bridge and Haswell
   processors, are made on a 22-nanometer process.
