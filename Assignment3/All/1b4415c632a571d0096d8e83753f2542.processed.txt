   What's This?

   By Seth Fiegerman2013-09-18 13:48:50 UTC

   If you've ever wished you could get your [48]YouTube fix even when your
   phone isn't connected to the Internet, you're in luck.

   YouTube announced late Tuesday that it plans to introduce a new feature
   in November that will let users "add videos" to their mobile device to
   watch offline.

   See also: [49]20 Funniest YouTube Videos According to Reddit

   "Your fans' ability to enjoy your videos no longer has to be
   interrupted by something as commonplace as a morning commute," the
   company wrote in a [50]blog post.

   The video service doesn't spell out exactly how the offline viewing
   will work, but [51]AllThingsD reports that users will be able to save
   videos for offline viewing for up to 48 hours.

10 Incredible Inspirational Moments on YouTube

    1.

       IFRAME: [52]http://www.youtube.com/embed/wnYXbJ_bcLc

1. The Fall of the Berlin Wall
       The fall of the Berlin Wall changed Europe politically and the
       German city physically. Ushering in a new era of freedom for a new
       decade, this footage from 1989 offers powerful imagery of East and
       West reuniting after nearly 40 years of enforced separation.
    2.

2. The Moon Landing
       We never get tired of watching this amazing clip. The 1969 Apollo
       11 mission to the moon was a remarkable achievement for all of
       mankind, and its morale-boosting effects on the United States at
       the time of the Cold War can't be underestimated.
    3.

3. Tiananmen Square Protests
       The anonymous "Tank Man" of this heart-stopping footage has never
       been identified, but the sight of him, unarmed, planted firmly in
       front of a line of tanks in Tiananmen Square in 1989 has become an
       enduring symbol of amazing courage.
    4.

4. Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" Speech
       It may have been a while since you last heard Dr. Martin Luther
       King Jr.'s famous speech in full, rather than just the highlights.
       Despite social change since 1963, there are still wider lessons to
       be drawn from the civil rights hero's historic words.
    5.

5. Professor Stephen Hawking's Zero-Gravity Flight
       Not letting his ALS condition get in the way of a glittering
       academic career, Stephen Hawking is one of the most inspiring
       humans alive today. Here, at age 65, he experiences zero-gravity to
       help increase public interest in space exploration.
    6.

6. Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympics
       You could argue that America's first blow against Nazi Germany in
       the Second World War came in 1936, as African-American Jesse Owens,
       the grandson of a slave, competed in the Berlin Olympics. In the
       midst of Nazi propaganda about "Aryan superiority," Owens
       discredited Hitler's hideous racial assertions and came away with
       four gold medals.
    7.

7. Wright Brothers
       We take flying for granted now, but this clip gives us a glimpse of
       how remarkable sustained mechanical flight was, as the Wright
       Brothers strove to achieve what many considered absolutely
       impossible.
    8.

       IFRAME: [59]http://www.youtube.com/embed/Jll5baCAaQU

8. President-Elect Barack Obama's Victory Speech
       Although President Barack Obama's inauguration speech is the one
       that will be quoted and referenced in years to come, we think his
       victory speech from Grant Park in his home town of Chicago best
       captures the electric excitement, and historic magnitude of his
       election into office.
    9.

9. Roger Bannister Breaks the Four-Minute Mile
       Although by today's standards, Bannister's physical achievement is
       not that impressive, what doesn't diminish over time is how
       inspiring his dedication and ultimate success is. Bannister broke
       the four-minute mile through sheer determination. When asked how he
       reached his goal, he explained, "It's the ability to take more out
       of yourself than you've got."
   10.

10. Gandhi's Dandi Salt March
       This incredible footage from 1930 shows a 61-year-old Gandhi on the
       famous Dandi March, in which he and his followers challenged
       British authority by protesting a salt tax with a peaceful 240-mile
       procession. The march was a seminal moment in the "Civil
       Disobedience Movement," a very influential non-violent initiative
       that would eventually lead to Indian independence from British
       rule.
