Patriot Act author says NSA's bulk data collection is "unbounded in its
scope"

Veteran Republican Congressman argues that government's rationale is absurd.

   Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), center, has now become Congress' most
   outspoken opponent to the NSA's metadata program.
   [10]Talk Radio News Service

   In one of the most prominent legal challenges to government
   intelligence gathering since the Edward Snowden disclosures, the
   American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a lawsuit against four
   top Obama Administration officials. The case, [11]known as ACLU v.
   Clapper, asks a federal judge to declare the entire metadata sharing
   program unlawful, halt it, and purge all related records.

   On Thursday, Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI),
   with [12]representation from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF),
   filed an amicus brief with the court. He noted that the vast data
   handover is not at all what Congress intended to happen. And
   Sensenbrenner should know, too, because he authored the [13]Patriot Act
   in October 2001 and supported its subsequent reauthorizations. In
   particular, [14]Section 215 of that law, which expanded government
   surveillance power of business records, is what the government argues
   gives it the authority to collect metadata in bulk.

   Sensenbrenner writes:

     The vast majority of the records collected will have no relation to
     the investigation of terrorism at all. This collection of millions
     of unrelated records is built-in to the mass call collection
     program. Defendants' theory of "relevance" is simply beyond any
     reasonable understanding of the word. And it certainly is not what
     amicus intended the word to mean.

     ...

     Defendants do not explain why Congress would have enacted such
     meaningless provisions. The bulk data collection program is
     unbounded in its scope. The NSA is gathering on a daily basis the
     details of every call that every American makes, as well as every
     call made by foreigners to or from the United States. How can every
     call that every American makes or receives be relevant to a specific
     investigation?

   In [15]previous court filings, the government has relied on a
   well-established (but [16]increasingly challenged) part of American
   case-law known as the "[17]third-party doctrine." This notion says that
   when a person has voluntarily disclosed information to a third
   party--in this case, the telco--the customer no longer has a reasonable
   expectation of privacy over numbers dialed or call duration. Therefore,
   this doctrine argues, such metadata can be accessed by law enforcement
   with essentially no problem.

   Also on Thursday [18]other amici joined the ACLU v. Clapper case,
   including Michael Lynch, a professor of philosophy at the University of
   Connecticut, the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, and
   the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA even argued that the
   creation of a vast phone records database constituted a de facto gun
   owners' list.

   "Under the government's reading of Section 215, the government could
   simply demand the periodic submission of all firearms dealers'
   transaction records, then centralize them in a database indexed by the
   buyers' names for later searching," the NRA writes in its filing.
