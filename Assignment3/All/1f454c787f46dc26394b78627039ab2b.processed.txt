[10]"MOOCs" for Credit Come to California

   by [11]Audrey Watters on 15 Jan, 2013

   Take note, folks. It's here: "MOOCs" for credit.

   California Governor Jerry Brown, San Jose State University President Mo
   Qayoumi, and [12]Udacity co-founder and CEO Sebastian Thrun held a
   press conference this morning to announce a pilot program that marks a
   first for the state: San Jose State will award college credits for
   special versions of select Udacity classes.

   The pilot program will be available to a group of 300 students from San
   Jose State, community colleges and high schools, but it's really aimed
   at the latter two groups -- in the hopes of boosting students' "college
   readiness" and with the recognition that the wait lists for
   California's community colleges make it incredibly challenging for
   these students to get into introductory classes. (In the fall of this
   school year, [13]The LA Times reported that some 470,000 California
   students were on waiting lists for community college classes.)

   The pilot will offer 3 classes -- remedial algebra, college algebra,
   and statistics -- and will do so too at a cost one-tenth the tuition of
   regular classes (cost: $150), according to Udacity's Sebastian Thrun,
   who quipped that "This is the single cheapest way in the country to
   earn college credit."

   But as Thrun stressed at [14]last week's Reboot CA Higher Education
   event, the emphasis must be on making education better not just
   cheaper.

The Year of the "MOOC"?

   I can't help but notice that even The New York Times didn't use "MOOC"
   the its headline or URL for this story: "[15]California to Give Web
   Courses a Big Trial." I'd quibble, I suppose, that California has tried
   Web courses before now, but there you go. Even San Jose State itself
   has offered blended learning classes in conjunction with edX. But heck,
   "MOOC" isn't mentioned in the NYT story 'til sentence number 4.

   As for me, I've put "MOOCs" in scare quotes throughout this piece.
   Perhaps it's clear by now that the evolution of these "new" online
   courses has veered away from the [16]original MOOC vision -- both the
   [17]cMOOC and the xMOOC variety. There are now registration
   restrictions and enrollment caps; the content is not openly licensed;
   classes have offline components; they are not free.

   Sebastian Thrun describes these iterations as "MOOC 2.0" and says
   Udacity has come to recognize that most learners require more than
   simply the videos and exercises that the xMOOCs have offered thus far.
   "They need mentors," he told me in a phone interview this weekend;
   "peers and professionals" [18]as he described it at the [19]Reboot
   California Higher Education event last week.

   The mentors for the pilot program will be hired and trained by Udacity.
   There will still be professor involvement in the classes (SJSU
   professors are the "faculty of record"); and while I cannot imagine
   that there won't be some pushback, Thrun stresses that this pilot
   program has the approval of SJSU's faculty members. He stresses too
   that even though Udacity is offering more human support versus just the
   algorithmic feedback offered through the Web interface, that this all
   will still "scale."

Remediation and Research

   The additional support offered by the Udacity-SJSU pilot program aims
   to reduce the high rate of attrition from most "MOOCs." As it currently
   stands, some 90% of those who enroll in MOOCs fail to complete the
   class. Whether you see the lower barriers to sign up and drop out as
   [20]a feature or a bug, it's not a statistic that will work with more
   formalized classes (particularly with new language in Governor Brown's
   [21]2013-2014 budget that seeks to tie community college funding to
   course completion rather than course enrollment).

   Indeed the high dropout rates from "MOOCs" might be particularly
   troubling for the program that Udacity and San Jose State are promising
   to offer -- one that focuses on college prep and college remediation.
   No doubt there is a big demand for remedial classes -- more than half
   of incoming CSU students need to take them, and these classes cost them
   tuition (and financial aid) dollars but do not count towards
   graduation. But it's not clear that "MOOCs" are the right solution
   here. These students are, quite likely, a different group than those
   self-motivated learners who are successfully completing "MOOCs" in
   their current format.

   Of course, this hasn't stopped other groups from
   investigating/investing in the possibilities of "MOOCs." The Gates
   Foundation [22]gave a grant to edX to offer community college courses
   and has made [23]additional funding available to those who develop
   remedial MOOCs. (I don't want to make too much of the competition
   between edX and Udacity and Coursera here, but it's probably worth
   noting, if even in passing.)

   Much of the debate about "MOOCs" -- how/if they will work; how/if they
   will work for the novice or struggling learner; how/if they will lower
   costs; how/if they will expand access; how/if they will boost quality
   -- is now being framed in terms of "research." Many of the panelists at
   [24]last week's Rebooting California Higher Education echoed this. (We
   need "rigorous research" into online learning, said Lillian Taiz,
   President of the California Faculty Association. "We owe it to the
   students.") "This is," as Thrun explained in our phone interview, "an
   experiment."

   While experimentation and research are both necessary, I do think we
   should consider exactly where -- [25]on whom? -- this occurs and how
   it's being framed. I think there are many questions to ask here about
   what high school students and community college students need to
   succeed in college -- about the best ways to teach algebra and
   statistics, for example, about the support services students need,
   about what "MOOCs" can and cannot provide (and at what cost savings).
   I'd argue too that some of these things aren't really "research
   questions"; the answers are already available (perhaps locked away in
   closed access academic journals, I suppose). We do know a lot about
   teaching and learning online and offline. There is expertise in high
   schools; there is expertise at community colleges; there is expertise
   at university campuses. Much of that expertise -- be it in instruction,
   in instructional design, in student support services -- has been
   stripped due to budget cuts. Can MOOCs really address this? And do we
   want for-profit companies to be the ones who try?

   Thrun dismisses the hype about "MOOCs" as a silver bullet for all our
   budgetary and educational woes. But as he took to the podium with
   Governor Jerry Brown today to announce "MOOCs for credit" at one of
   California's oldest and largest public universities, the politics that
   push for silver bullets do seem glaringly obvious.
