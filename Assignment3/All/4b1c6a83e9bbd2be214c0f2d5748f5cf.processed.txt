   Mashable Op-Ed

   This post reflects the opinions of the author and not necessarily those
   of Mashable as a publication.

   "Shame on you, AT&T." "Very tasteless." "Pathetic."

   These were not the responses AT&T expected after posting its [48]Sept.
   11 photo tribute on Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday. The company
   miscalculated the public's reaction to a picture, which may have been
   an homage to this authentically touching 9/11 [49]Village Voice cover.
   The image also continued a visual motif that the brand had used in
   preceding posts on Facebook.

   AT&T was hardly the only brand to weigh in on 9/11. Everyone from
   Boar's Head to the L.A. Lakers offered tributes, which were met by
   varying degrees of incredulity and disgust. As a journalist, I'm happy
   to see brands continue to screw up in social media. As a public
   service, though, I'd like to offer the following suggestions.

Refrain From Participating in Certain Holidays

   Sept. 11 -- though not a holiday per se -- is an excellent example of a
   day many people commemorate, and would prefer to do so without the
   input of brands. Others include Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Veterans
   Day and Memorial Day. I realize that marketers are people, too, and
   have their own emotional reactions to the day. So why not put a message
   on your website instead of blasting it in social media? If you feel as
   though you absolutely can't avoid social media on such days, then stick
   to short, simple comments about saluting our heroes in uniform or mourn
   the loss of victims. Don't try to exploit the day to sell products.

   In the future, you'd do well to follow the lead of Canon USA:

   [50]Post by [51]Canon.

Refrain From Participating in Certain Discussions

   As Sarah Hofstetter, president of digital marketing agency 360i, has
   previously noted, [52]not every cultural moment deserves a real-time
   response.

   A good counter example of this is Kenneth Cole, who has injected his
   brand into discussions about Egypt and [53]Syria not to say anything
   profound, but to get a cheap laugh or generate conversation. If people
   are talking about [54]Miley Cyrus at the VMAs and you have a pithy bon
   mot, you're probably on solid ground. If you want to poke fun at an
   incident in which people have died, though, you're probably best off
   staying on the sidelines. Leave that to the professionals like Bill
   Maher and Jon Stewart.

   Even if you want to say something nice, you're best off avoiding doing
   so on Twitter, [55]as Kmart learned the hard way last year during the
   Newtown shootings. Of course, Kmart would have received a better
   reaction if had avoided bundling its condolence with a promotional
   hashtag.

When You Apologize, Just Say "I'm Sorry"

   People understand when you screw up and are willing to accept your
   apology. Since you're appealing to others' good will, don't risk
   compounding your initial error with a pissy apology. Case in point:
   Esquire on Wednesday ran the wrong picture next to a story on its
   website. It was a significant error and people were justly up in arms.
   But Esquire's apology -- telling people to "relax" -- didn't help
   matters.

     Relax, everybody. There was a stupid technical glitch on our
     "Falling Man" story and it was fixed asap. We're sorry for the
     confusion.

     -- Esquire Magazine (@Esquiremag) [56]September 11, 2013

   A better example is Mountain Dew. When the brand ran a vile video on
   its website and got flak on social media, it not only offered a brief
   apology that appeared to come from a human but also [57]bought promoted
   tweets to make sure everyone saw its mea culpa.

Don't Let Bots Run Your Feed

   Finally, avoid looking like a bot by not letting bots run your feed. It
   may seem like a good idea to program your tweets for a few hours, but
   you never know when news will break that will make you look out of
   touch.

   Many brands [58]learned this lesson during the Newtown shootings when
   their prosy sales pitches suddenly looked heartless. Similarly, there's
   nothing like an actual human to assess feedback and formulate an
   appropriate response. Just look at [59]Bank of America's HAL 9000-like
   unraveling on Twitter recently.

   There are a million other ways to screw up in social media, but these
   are some of the big ones. For brands, this is primarily a defensive
   game. You can be faulted for not reacting quickly enough, but that's
   nothing compared to the wrath you incur by reacting inappropriately.
