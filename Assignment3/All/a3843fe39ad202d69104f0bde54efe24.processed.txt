Guest post: creating scientists in 140 characters

   By [68]Cristina Russo
   Posted: September 9, 2013

   I first talked to[69] John Roman[70]o when he agreed to give an
   interview for our Sci-Ed story "[71]Anatomy Lesson". John was just back
   from ComicCon, and his enthusiasm (in comics and in science alike) was
   palpable on the phone.  He blogs for [72]Convergent Education, sharing
   his experiences in science education. Today, we get to hear one of his
   novel approaches, which illustrates the use of twitter in sci-ed (topic
   we covered in our [73]three [74]part[75] series).

   As a high school science teacher I am constantly looking for new tools
   to improve my students' education. The most recent addition to my
   educational toolbox is live-tweeting. High school students are adept at
   using smartphones and teachers typically struggle to prevent the use of
   this technology in class, but the effectiveness of such policies is
   slim when they are outnumbered 25:1. So I decided to invoke the age old
   adage "If you can't beat em', join `em," and introduce Twitter into my
   classroom.  The Science Online conference in Raleigh, NC, known
   unofficially as [76]#Scio13, provided the inspiration.

   So I decided, let's try this in class.  In my high school senior-level
   class, Evolution & Comparative Anatomy, we often use documentaries to
   expose students to things like the dissection of animals that most
   people will never get to see.  I am constantly stopping the video to
   let them take notes.  It is a very slow and tedious process -- one that
   is on the way out.  Combine this with the constant battle of having
   students secretly texting, or using social media during class, and the
   answer was obvious.

    Let them use Twitter to take notes.

   ***

   There are some concerns as an educator when you are using social media
   in a classroom. In fact it is still a large grey area for many schools
   on whether or not teachers and students should even interact on social
   media. So to take care of any problems that might arise, I first spent
   a whole class period going over the proper use of Twitter.  They each
   set up a specific "student" Twitter account that I told them would be
   viewable by any administrator, teacher, parent, scientist, admissions
   officer, etc.

   After these lessons, my class of 16 students was ready to live-tweet
   their first documentary. Because we were an evolution and comparative
   anatomy class there was no better show to watch than [77]Inside
   Nature's Giants. We had already watched a few episodes of this series
   and the students were always allowed to take notes and then use these
   notes on a short-answer test that I would give them afterwards.  (I try
   to always use open-note tests because rarely is a scientist without the
   ability to look up information, and with the advent of the Internet
   grey-matter-recall is becoming a thing of the past.) The students have
   always scored decently on this, but it was always the same breakdown:
   individuals who took copious notes scored well, those who were half
   into it and took OK notes did OK, and those who went from memory alone
   barely passed.

   I set up the video and put my computer on the screen as well with the
   timeline for our hashtag running in the background so the students
   could see what was being tweeted.

   The results were instantaneous -- it was like being plugged into every
   student's brain at once. You could see who was participating, who was
   getting the main ideas, who was extrapolating and asking good
   questions, and more importantly, the students could see what their
   peers were thinking.

   This was something that really helped, when someone tweeted a fact and
   half the class also tweeted the same fact it reinforced the students
   that they were on the right track. I would also tweet along with them
   to help them see if they were on the right page. The beauty of all this
   was that it was all uninterrupted documentary watching. No stopping and
   starting, no asking what was just said, it just flowed.

   [78]twitter paleoromano students 1

   As you can see in the image above the fact about where animals get
   their hydration is reinforced by students and the teacher, plus it is
   stated in three different ways. It also allowed students to add a
   little of their own personality and humor to the class-sourced notes.

   [79]twitter paleoromano students 2 - edited

   Due to retweeting and including the hosts in tweets, we caught the
   attention of other scientists who would chime in with facts, adding to
   the already huge pile of streaming information we were gathering under
   our hashtag. For example, our tweeting inspired a scientist to blog
   about lions after she came across our #INLion hashtag regarding a lion
   documentary.

    [80] twitter tasha metacookbook

   The part that really made me want to high-five myself as a teacher was
   watching the students' reactions when they got a retweet by me, a
   classmate, or another scientist.  The retweets validated their
   knowledge on the subject matter. Young people (and even adults) live
   for a retweet by their favorite celebrity or scientist, and seeing a
   seventeen-year-old let out a "WOOHOO!" when a scientist retweeted their
   fact on the camel cardiovascular system was one of those moments that
   made the low pay and long hours of teaching worthwhile.

   Then it happened -- the host of the documentary started getting
   involved in our Twitter conversations. Simon Watt, the young, colorful
   co-host of Inside Nature's Giants started conversing with us on Twitter
   answering questions and adding various anecdotes to the documentary.
   The students were loving it; it was like having the author of their
   textbook available for questions. It humanized the two-dimensional
   scientist on the screen and made him real.

   [81]twitter paleoromano simon watt simondwatt

   Simon agreed to Skype with the class and we had one of the best hours
   of my teaching career. The students asked Simon questions, interacted
   with him, and saw him a as a regular person -- someone like them.  It
   was a bit awkward at first, as Skype sessions usually are, but soon
   they fell into the flow and they were exchanging laughs.  I think that
   was a moment where most of those high school seniors realized being a
   scientist is something they were capable of doing. That those people on
   the documentaries we watch aren't unlike them, and if they wanted to
   they could pursue a career in science.

   This has always been my goal -- to create scientists -- and it floors
   me that a hashtag and 140 characters can do so much toward
   accomplishing that.

       Fantastic post, but it can't be that if all high school classes get
       on twitter they'll all get to talk to the people who host their
       documentaries - that's great, twitter gives you a good way to find
       out who has time to read their @references, but in terms of
       advocacy that can't usually happen if twitter really does get taken
       up widely. But of course for the documentary hosts, if they get to
       answer questions a few times per year it will be tremendous and
       useful feedback to them.

       This is wonderfully creative! Did you give the post-viewing quiz as
       before, and what were the results like? Did more students
       participate in the tweet note-taking or did it fall along regular
       lines, ie students normally taking good notes tweeted the most and
       students that participate less were more silent on twitter? It'd be
       great to see that otherwise less involved students gave more
       attention to this new approach.

            I did give the post viewing quiz, same style, nothing was
            changed from previous quizzes (except the content). Students
            did much better, while this data set is small and can only be
            viewed as anecdotal, it should be further investigated.
            There were some students who weren't as active on twitter on
            others, but there were more examples of students who became
            more active once twitter was used.
            Again, all anecdotal, but my overall conclusion is that this
            style engaged more students and led to higher grades.

       Great work John! You have taken students from passive observers to
       active participants...now that's teaching!

       Great job on introducing new technology to the classroom.
       I believe the ability to adapt is integral to our survival.
       But that is a comment for another lesson.

       Great post! Twitter is a very valuable resource in University - I
       use it in a field biology course at McGill University - a post here
       describes it. This Fall will be more intensive, and you can follow
       along with #ENVB222 -tweets will be from students, and all about
       natural history.
