   Despite an impressive track record of pioneering technology, today's
   consumer electronics industry finds itself in the throes of a of
   massive transformation, driven by the proliferation of Internet-enabled
   devices that offer new intelligence and connectivity rivaling the
   ubiquity of electricity.

   The tectonic shift is compelling electronics companies to search for
   new and sustainable growth opportunities as they set course to ride the
   next wave of the [18]Internet of Things. The solution for a growing
   number of companies lies in the increasing possibilities of data
   [19]analytics and [20]cloud computing.

   With billions of people connected by nearly a trillion devices by 2015,
   untapped data will create a wealth of value that is just starting to be
   understood by both the consumer and those that make and sell devices
   and services. While building smart devices that connect to the
   Internet, consumer electronics companies are starting to consider
   devices that capture and convert that data into insights for action to
   [21]deliver new experiences.

   As development continues, a service infrastructure to support those
   devices is starting to form, as well as new ways to build bridges to
   innovative services. For example, some consumer electronics companies
   are starting to employ [22]cloud-based service delivery approaches that
   utilize mobile applications and analytics capabilities to bring new
   value to people. Others are rolling out devices already connected with
   a service delivery platform and that exploit new web development tools
   to help consumers realize the promise of a smarter home.

   At the heart of this development is collaboration and a lot of it was
   on display at [23]IFA in Berlin this week.

   A good example is the [24]Smart TV Alliance, which is a collaborative
   effort to build open solutions-based technologies that enhance the
   television viewing experience. Other technology solutions being
   demonstrated at IFA this week:
     * IBM and Texas Instruments explained how connecting appliances to
       the Internet can help manufacturers get closer to their customers
       and build a better consumer experience. Using the pervasive
       presence of WiFi networks in homes, for example, household
       appliances such as [25]washing machines can be connected via the
       cloud to the manufacturer. There, [26]Big Data techniques can be
       used to analyze the wealth of the data to make the appliances more
       reliable through predictive maintenance, such as alerting consumers
       when a filter needs to be cleaned or changed. Also, such
       information can help manufacturers better understand how the
       appliances are being used, to help improve the designs of the next
       generation;
     * In a joint Smart Home project, Tatung, Shaspa and IBM showed how
       consumers can manage a variety of convenience, comfort and safety
       activities such as controlling security and lighting systems -
       using any mobile device capable of running the apps;
     * Silicon Valley start-up NexStep Inc. demonstrated a [27]mobile
       solution that is making it easier for consumers to install and
       connect home devices while also helping them to solve technical
       with a few clicks.

   The shift in the consumer electronics industry is moving quickly. But
   manufacturers are responding with smarter devices and connectivity
   solutions that will not only improve the consumer experience, but
   establish a stronger connection between consumer and supplier.

   A very interesting article to read. However, I would very much like to
   hear a professional opinion on the aspect of personal security and
   consumer benefits.

   It is clearly beneficial to the producers and retailers to include
   cloud services in their products, but I fail to see the benefit of the
   individual in many instances. To stick with the instances explained
   above...cloud based lightning solutions? On paper, it sounds great, I
   could finally control the lights in the room for my presentation
   without needing an "assistant" to lower the brightness in the room!

   In the real world, it generates a whole bunch of problems, which I have
   tried to summarized below:

   1. How will these cloud solutions alter the bandwith usage of a site?

   As these cloud solutions are highly reliant on the cloud (a.k.a. the
   Internet), what is the guarantee that the servers won't overload when
   2-300 people want to adjust the lights in their offices at the same
   time?

   2. What security measures need to be implemented to avoid unauthorized
   entries?

   Smartphones are highly susceptible to virus attacks and hackers as they
   don't have an adequate defense against phising and malware. Cloud
   services create a huge attack surface on a company with hundreds of
   unprotected smartphones ready to be exploited for company ID's and
   accesses.

   3. Is the IT staff experienced and equipped to successfully react to an
   unauthorized entry?

   Cloud solutions seem to be the perfect avenue of a Denial of Service
   attack (a.k.a. DDoS, a method which consists of efforts to temporarily
   or indefinitely interrupt or suspend services of a host connected to
   the Internet). An overloaded server could easily interrupt the
   Continuity of Business, creating complete chaos in the workflow of the
   affected departments. And I'm not even mentioning the costs of the
   fallout.

   Every on-site IT department needs to have adequate processes to
   successfully withstand such aggression towards the company
   infrastructure, or there must be a centralized off-site reaction team,
   ready to intercept in case of such scenarios.

   Although I am enthusiastic about the emergence of the Cloud, I can't
   ignore the dangers it represents to the existing hierarchy and
   infrastructure of any company. The cloud will change the world. For the
   better or worse, we will all see in the days to come.
