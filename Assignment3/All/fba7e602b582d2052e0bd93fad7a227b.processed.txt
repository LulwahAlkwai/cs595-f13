   Evernote by itself is an amazing tool to stay organized and productive,
   but once you you combine it with automation, they sky is the limit.
   When you mention great web application automation, you only need to go
   as far as [22]ITFFF.  I have been using IFTTT for a couple of years,
   but have found its greatest potential for myself when I started using
   some of the Evernote recipes the service offers.  Here are a few of my
   favorites...

Receive a receipt by email, send it to Evernote

   I receive a bunch of receipts by email now-a-days, from Amazon to
   iTunes to Dick's Sporting Goods, and keeping them in my email system is
   not very effective.  Evernote is a perfect place to store receipts, so
   this recipe send them right to Evernote with whatever tags you want
   associated with them.  [23]Find this recipe on IFTTT by clicking here.

Recording meeting minute notes in Evernote

   This recipe creates a note in Evernote automatically 15 minutes before
   your meeting, setting everything up so you can take meeting notes
   faster!  [24]Find this recipe on IFTTT by clicking here.

Keep a running list in Evernote of newly added streaming titles on Netflix

   I am a daily user of Netflix, but keeping track of the new titles that
   come out is hard.  This recipe adds all new streaming titles right to
   your Evernote account.  [25]Find this recipe on IFTTT by clicking

Create a new checklist / to-do note every morning

   Every morning, this recipe creates a new note template for me in
   Evernote to fill in my checklist and to-do's for the day.  [26]Find

Send emails with attachments to Evernote

   Whenever I get an email with an attachment, it automatically sends the
   file to Evernote.  [27]Find this recipe on IFTTT by clicking here.
