   By Christopher Shea

   Imagine that psychologists are scanning a patient's brain, for some
   basic research purpose. As they do so, they stumble across a fleeting
   thought that their equipment is able to decode: The patient has
   committed a murder, or is thinking of committing one soon. What would
   the researchers be obliged to do with that information?

   That hypothetical was floated a few weeks ago at the first meeting of
   the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues devoted
   to exploring societal and ethical issues raised by the government's
   Brain initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative
   Neurotechnologies), which will put some $100-million in 2014 alone into
   the goal of mapping the brain. The commission has been asked to examine
   issues facing researchers and society now, as well as those around the
   corner.

   It will be months, at least, before we learn the group's answer to that
   question and others raised by advancing neurotechnology.

   But one commissioner present on that August morning at the University
   of Pennsylvania has been exploring precisely those sorts of far-out
   scenarios. Will brain scans undermine traditional notions of privacy?
   Are existing constitutional protections sufficient to guard our freedom
   of thought, or are new laws required as fMRI scanners and EEG detectors
   grow evermore precise?

   Asking those questions is the Duke University professor of law Nita A.
   Farahany, 37, a rising voice in her field. "We have this idea of
   privacy that includes the space around our thoughts, which we only
   share with people we want to," Farahany said in a telephone interview
   before the meeting. "Neuroscience shows that what we thought of as this
   zone of privacy can be breached." In one recent law-review article, she
   warned against a "coming siege against cognitive liberties."

   Her particular interest is in how brain scans reshape our understanding
   of, or are checked by, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the
   Constitution. Respectively, they protect against "unreasonable searches
   and seizures" and self-incrimination, which forbids the state to turn
   any citizen into "a witness against himself." Will "taking the Fifth,"
   a time-honored tactic in American courtrooms, mean anything in a world
   where the government can scan your brain? The answer may depend a lot
   on how the law comes down on another question: Is a brain scan more
   like an interview or a blood test?

   Farahany, whom Duke lured away from Vanderbilt University last year, is
   a child of immigrants from Iran. Her interest in privacy was stoked
   early, by dinnertime conversations about that country's repressive
   practices. She began her legal-academic career by looking at the
   intersection of behavioral genetics and the law--her undergraduate
   major was in genetics and biology, and she has a Ph.D. in philosophy in
   addition to her J.D., both from Duke. But neuroscience began to
   interest her because it has less to do with probabilistic outcomes
   within populations than with concrete issues involving specific human
   beings, not to mention its hold on people's imaginations.

   Her work--notably two law-review articles published last year,
   "Incriminating Thoughts," in the Stanford Law Review, and "Searching
   Secrets," in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review--adds to a
   robust discussion in the legal literature about how neuroscience will
   alter American jurisprudence, a discussion that has spawned articles
   with such titles as "Is My Mind Mine? Neuroethics and Brain Imaging"
   and "The Government Can Read Your Mind: Can the Constitution Stop It?"

   Farahany believes there's no guarantee. And she has plenty of allies in
   arguing that there's a hole in constitutional law that needs to be
   patched where mental privacy is concerned.

   The commission's work may help to put questions of neuroprivacy on the
   national agenda. So might a new documentary, Brains on Trial, airing in
   two parts on PBS this month. Hosted by the actor Alan Alda, the
   documentary discusses the potential and the limitations of brain scans
   in the courtroom. Farahany offers commentary, and even gamely climbs
   into an fMRI scanner to see if her brain reveals whether she recognizes
   photographs of certain faces. It does. But she can also game the
   machine by pretending not to recognize them.

   The ways of peering into the brain are myriad. Neural lie detection
   using fMRI scans, which measure blood flow, has attempted to identify
   areas of the brain that register more activity when someone is trying
   to conceal information. A separate kind of "concealed information test"
   makes use of electroencephalography (EEG). In one variation, pursued by
   J. Peter Rosenfeld, of Northwestern University, the relative strength
   of a brain wave known as P300 is used to determine whether a test
   subject is familiar with a particular location, weapon, or plot.

   Jack Gallant, at the University of California at Berkeley, has had some
   success in reconstructing, on video monitors, scenes of images that
   test subjects are viewing--simply by examining brain data. His team
   analyzes how subjects' brains respond to a large stock of movie
   trailers and video clips. The researchers create a "dictionary" of the
   brain activity caused by those scenes; in subsequent sessions, decoding
   software infers, by matching patterns of blood flow in the brain with
   patterns seen in previous viewings, what subjects are watching at the
   present time--and they recreate those scenes on monitors. In one
   instance described in Brains on Trial, when a test subject thinks of an
   image of vegetables, the computer produces a picture of precisely that.

   "The more you describe how these techniques are getting better," Alda
   tells Farahany during Brains on Trial, "the more I wonder how different
   that is from Big Brother looking into our heads."

   Granted, it's easy to get swept up in neurohype. In Brains on Trial,
   the cognitive scientist Nancy Kanwisher, at the Massachusetts Institute
   of Technology, dismisses fMRI lie-detection as "noisy, feeble," and
   "error prone," and says it would be "insane" to rely on it. On the
   other hand, Berkeley's Gallant says that although it will take an
   unforeseen breakthrough, "assuming that science keeps marching on,
   there will eventually be a radar detector that you can point at
   somebody and it will read their brain cognitions remotely."

   What's more, some scholars think that lie detectors, or
   concealed-information detectors, are already working far better than
   acknowledged by analysts or by courts, which generally but not
   completely forbid their use. The machines are far from perfect, but
   juries rely on all sorts of faulty folk wisdom in determining who is
   lying and who is telling the truth. (Crucially, courts have excluded
   the detectors not on principle but because they have not won the
   approval of scientists.)

   Farahany is well aware that we are a long way from portable memory
   downloaders. "I'm taking 'proof of concept' technology and thinking
   about the implications," she says. Her goal is to establish a new lens
   through which to view privacy issues, so her arguments do not hinge on
   the success or failure of any specific technique.

   This brings up the question of whether a brain scan is "physical"
   evidence--like a fingerprint--or "testimonial" evidence. To grapple
   with that, it helps to know a bit about the convoluted development of
   the concept of self-incrimination in the United States.

   Some physical evidence used to be harder to introduce into the
   courtroom. Into the 20th century, some states would allow defendants,
   on Fifth Amendment grounds, to decline to reveal even their shoe size.
   In determining the line between physical and testimonial, a crucial
   case was Schmerber v. California (1966), in which a drunken-driving
   suspect was forced to give a blood sample, whose results were damning.

   Library, Monty Rakusen, Science Photo Library

   The tools of forensic science, which include fingerprint scans,
   lie-detector tests,and ballistic analysis, are being extended by
   neuroscience.

   He and his lawyers argued that this was self-incriminating evidence
   that should have been stricken from the record. But over a blistering
   dissent by Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, the U.S. Supreme
   Court ruled that blood was physical evidence and not "testimony." The
   court also decided that this kind of time-sensitive, minimally invasive
   search did not require a warrant, because police had probable cause to
   think that the defendant was drunk, and blood-alcohol content drops
   with time. (Muddying the waters, in a ruling issued in April, Missouri
   v. McNeely, the court revisited the issue and concluded that the
   constitutionality of warrantless blood draws, in the DWI context, must
   be determined case by case. Justice Antonin Scalia predicted that the
   decision will cause chaos.)

   In a passing comment that hasn't been tested, the justices in Schmerber
   wrote: "Some tests seemingly directed to obtain 'physical
   evidence'"--i.e., old-fashioned lie detectors measuring things like
   heart rate and skin temperature--"may actually be directed to eliciting
   responses which are essentially testimonial."

   With brain scans, the distinction really starts to fall apart. Consider
   a thought experiment that Farahany uses in "Incriminating Thoughts." A
   woman is murdered in her home by a masked man wielding a hammer--an act
   captured on videotape--but first she's able to deliver a blow to his
   head with the tool. After that counterattack, an accomplice of the man
   spurs his companion to kill the woman by yelling, "Let's go!" The
   police (correctly) suspect that the killer was the woman's husband.
   Brain scans done on the husband, she writes, could determine several
   things. Did the alleged killer suffer brain damage of the sort a hammer
   blow might cause? What were his "automatic and physiological responses"
   to photographs of his wife--disdain and loathing? Love and sadness?
   They could also see whether the suspect recalled the "Let's go" urging,
   and could retrieve shards of memories from that night, as in the
   research at Gallant's lab.

   Under current doctrine, it might be consistent to accept all of those
   scans as permissible. After all, the scans are no more intrusive than a
   blood draw, and they measure physical characteristics, like blood flow
   and electrical impulses.

   To help think through the puzzles, Farahany proposes a new taxonomy of
   information, which would capture the types of thought-data being
   discussed. These more or less track where judges have drawn the line
   and provide hints about where we might redraw it, if we choose.

   Moving roughly from less protected to more protected, her categories
   are: identifying information, automatic information (produced by the
   brain or body without effort or conscious thought), memorialized
   information (that is, memories), and uttered information. (Contrary to
   idiomatic usage, her "uttered" information can include information
   uttered only in the mind. At the least, she observes, we may need
   stronger Miranda warnings, specifying that what you say, even silently
   to yourself, can be used against you.)

   The right against self-incrimination has its roots in efforts to
   eradicate confessions elicited by torture, but, as many lawyers have
   pointed out, it can seem hard to justify today. Why shouldn't people
   have to explain their alleged misdeeds? They have no right to keep
   their thoughts to themselves when other people's crimes are at issue,
   nor can they keep silent about their own crimes when they've been
   immunized against prosecution. So protecting privacy, per se, isn't at
   the core of the Fifth Amendment.

   Miranda warnings might need to specify that even what you say to
   yourself can be used against you.

   One overarching theory that purports to justify the right--the one that
   Farahany is most drawn to--was elaborated by the late William J.
   Stuntz, a professor of law at Harvard University: the "excuse theory."
   It says the Fifth Amendment applies when defendants are placed in the
   tight spot of having to choose between lying and incriminating
   themselves, a test many people would fail.

   Mating her information categories and Stuntz's theory, Farahany argues,
   in her thought experiment, that if brain scans were deployed only to
   determine that the husband has brain damage consistent with a hammer
   strike, that would count as identifying information. It would be like
   examining him to see if his skull is broken; he'd have been placed
   under no coercive pressure. Courts, too, would be unlikely to consider
   automatic responses to a photograph (visceral revulsion, for example)
   as self-incriminating, she thinks, because such reactions require no
   conscious decision to lie or not to lie. In contrast, classic
   lie-detection, involving yes-no answers and the retrieval of episodic
   memories, would fall into the utterance category and be the most likely
   to be protected by the Fifth Amendment.

   Memories are particularly vexing: If they can be retrieved like the
   files on a computer, Farahany suggests, they may be accorded little
   protection. If they require more-conscious reconstruction, a view that
   seems to better accord with current brain science, they would seem more
   like utterances.

   Of Farahany's categories, the Stanford law professor Henry T. Greely, a
   friend and mentor, says: "You don't find that fourfold distinction in
   the Constitution, you don't find it in 200 years of constitutional
   precedent, but it's the kind of thing we may need, to deal with privacy
   issues today."

   But what about the Fourth Amendment, which governs when warrants are
   required, and the limits of lawful searches? Here, Farahany introduces
   yet another factor to think about how courts might treat brain scans.
   Courts have tended, when weighing whether searches are overly
   intrusive, to focus on physical trespass. They have said a warrant is
   required if people have a "reasonable expectation of privacy" in the
   space where they are voicing their thoughts, but they've tended to
   define that language in terms of physical spaces (a telephone booth,
   one's home). "We haven't been generous about interpreting the Fourth
   Amendment to protect secrets," she says. "It's been more about physical
   intrusion." She wants to revive a latent respect for intellectual
   property that she says is also inherent in the amendment.

   Consider another hypothetical: a "stop and frisk" of the sort that has
   become controversial in New York. If police had hand-held brain
   scanners, they might be able to judge intoxication even less
   intrusively than with a Breathalyzer, and whether the person being
   examined was familiar with the faces of people involved in recent
   crimes. The greater the extent that people are "authors" of the
   information being examined, the more likely courts would protect it.

   That analysis has ramifications that extend beyond brain scans.
   Focusing on the sensitivity of secrets, as opposed to the physical
   intrusiveness of a search, might lead courts or legislatures to pay
   more deference to personal papers or even diaries, which have largely
   been considered fair game. What would be decisive is the sensitivity of
   the information, not whether it's in a diary, on a hard drive, or
   lodged in the brain.

   Where self-incrimination is concerned, Ronald J. Allen, a professor of
   law at Northwestern University, lauds Farahany's detailed presentation
   of the neuroscience but thinks her overall findings are more or less
   consistent with ones he reached a decade ago, using a far simpler
   analysis. In a paper written with M. Kristin Mace, he began by asking
   whether it would count as self-incriminating if someone were asked
   questions while affixed to a lie detector, gave no verbal answers, and
   yet had telltale bodily functions measured. Would that be testimony?
   Yes, they concluded.

   "When the government compels cognition and uses the substantive results
   of that against the defendant, that is privileged," Mr. Allen says in
   an interview--emphasizing that he is describing the arc of precedent
   and not any moral ideal.

   In a book to be published next month, Minds, Brains, and Law: The
   Conceptual Foundations of Law and Neuroscience (Oxford University
   Press), Michael S. Pardo and Dennis Patterson directly confront
   Farahany's work. They argue that her evidence categories do not
   necessarily track people's moral intuitions--that physical evidence can
   be even more personal than thought can. "We assume," they write, "that
   many people would expect a greater privacy interest in the content of
   information about their blood"--identifying or automatic information,
   like HIV status--"than in the content of their memories or evoked
   utterances on a variety of nonpersonal matters."

   On the Fifth Amendment question, the two authors "resist" the notion
   that a memory could ever be considered analogous to a book or an MP3
   file and be unprotected, the idea Farahany flirts with. And where the
   Fourth Amendment is concerned, Pardo, a professor of law at the
   University of Alabama, writes in an e-mail, "I do think that
   lie-detection brain scans would be treated like blood draws."

   Farahany agrees that the gap between how courts treat automatic
   information--the kind produced without conscious thought--and people's
   moral intuitions is problematic, but she argues that the categories can
   be a tool to expose that gap. More generally, she says, her critics are
   overly concerned with the "bright line" of physical testimony: "All of
   them are just grappling with current doctrine. What I'm trying to do is
   reimagine and newly conceive of how we think of doctrine."

   "The bright line has never worked," she continues. "Truthfully, there
   are things that fall in between, and a better thing to do is to
   describe the levels of in-betweenness than to inappropriately and with
   great difficulty assign them to one category or another."

   Among those staking out the brightest line is Paul Root Wolpe, a
   professor of bioethics at Emory University. "The skull," he says,
   "should be an absolute zone of privacy." He maintains that position
   even for the scenario of the suspected terrorist and the ticking time
   bomb, which is invariably raised against his position.

   "As Sartre said, the ultimate power or right of a person is to say,
   'No,'" Wolpe observes. "What happens if that right is taken away--if I
   say 'No' and they strap me down and get the information anyway? I want
   to say the state never has a right to use those technologies."

   Farahany stakes out more of a middle ground, arguing that, as with most
   legal issues, the interests of the state need to be balanced against
   those of the individual. Her taxonomy, she hopes, will provide a useful
   framework for a robust democratic debate about how the various
   interests can be weighted.

   Extending as it does beyond brain scans, her theory may also help
   provide answers to the looming "GPS" question, which is closely related
   to the hot-button telephone-metadata issue raised by recent revelations
   about the National Security Agency. In United States v. Jones, a case
   decided last year, the Supreme Court unanimously concluded that the
   government had conducted an illegal warrantless search when it placed a
   GPS device on the defendant's car. But the court decided the case on
   narrow grounds: Officials had missed the deadline imposed by a warrant
   by one day, and they had put the device on the car in Maryland, not the
   District of Columbia, as required.

   Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito went along with the decision,
   but both separately raised far-reaching questions. The information
   relayed by GPS devices has been viewed by the court as noninvasive, at
   least when cars are on public roads (after all, the police could always
   tail the car). Should it still be considered so, in the era of
   ubiquitous GPS, when suddenly the police can electronically tail all of
   our cars 24/7--to church, to our lovers' houses, to Tea Party meetings?

   "I would ask whether people reasonably expect that their movements will
   be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the Government to
   ascertain, more or less at will, their political and religious beliefs,
   sexual habits, and so on," Justice Sotomayor wrote.

   But the justices didn't push the issue--at least in that case. "At some
   point, they are going to have to deal with the informational issue,"
   Farahany says. "They can't ignore it forever." The nonprotection of
   automatic information, she writes, amounts to "a disturbing secret
   lurking beneath the surface of existing doctrine." Telephone metadata,
   another kind of automatic information, can, after all, be as revealing
   as GPS tracking.

   Farahany starts by showing how the secrets in our brains are threatened
   by technology. She winds up getting us to ponder all the secrets that a
   digitally savvy state can gain access to, with silky and ominous ease.


   Corrections (9/16/2013, 2 p.m.): This article originally identified
   Nita Farahany as an associate professor recruited from Vanderbilt this
   year. She is a full professor who was recruited last year; the article
   has been updated to reflect those corrections.
