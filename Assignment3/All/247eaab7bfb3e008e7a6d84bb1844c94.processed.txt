   Apple's iPhone Finger Print Reader: Breakthrough or Crap?
   If you read through ZDNet's debate on the topic you'll likely conclude
   it is crap. Both sides argue for and against the addition of the device
   but the con argument, to me, is the more powerful largely because a
   finger print reader should be a second security factor and because of
   the lack of an SDK can't function that way. However I do see it as a
   stepping stone and think it was good Apple brought it out, I expect
   much of is highlighted as its current limitations will be corrected by
   Apple, or someone else, and that makes it an important stepping stone.
