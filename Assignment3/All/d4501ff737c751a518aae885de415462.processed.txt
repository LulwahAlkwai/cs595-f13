   How you read matters as much as what you read. That's because nothing
   is written in a vacuum. Every news story or blog post has a perspective
   behind it, a perspective that shapes what you are told and how that
   information is conveyed. This is not, necessarily, a bad thing. Having
   a perspective doesn't mean being sensationalistic, or deceitful, or
   spreading propaganda. It can mean those things, but it doesn't have to.
   In fact, I'm fairly certain that it's impossible to tell any story
   without some kind of perspective. When you relate facts, even in your
   personal life, you make choices about what details you will emphasize,
   what emotions you'll convey, who you will speak to--and all of those
   decisions are based on your personal perspective. How we tell a story
   depends on what we think is important.

   Unfortunately, sometimes, perspective can be misleading. That's why
   it's important to be aware that perspective exists. If you look at what
   you're reading, you can see the decisions the author made, you can get
   an idea of what perspective they were trying to convey, and you will
   know whether that perspective is likely to distort the facts.

   Emily Willingham is a scientist who blogs about science for the general
   public. Over at Double X Science, she's come up with a handy, six-step
   guide for reading science news stories. These rules are a great tool
   for peeking behind the curtain, and learning to think about the
   perspective behind what you read. In the post, she explains why each of
   these rules is important, and then applies them to a recent news story
   about chemical exposure and autism.

     3. Look at the words in the articles. Suspected. Suggesting a link.
     In other words, what you're reading below those headlines does not
     involve studies linking anything to autism. Instead, it's based on
     an editorial listing 10 compounds [PDF] that the editorial authors
     suspect might have something to do with autism (NB: Both linked
     stories completely gloss over the fact that most experts attribute
     the rise in autism diagnoses to changing and expanded diagnostic
     criteria, a shift in diagnosis from other categories to autism, and
     greater recognition and awareness--i.e., not to genetic changes or
     environmental factors. The editorial does the same). The authors do
     not provide citations for studies that link each chemical cited to
     autism itself, and the editorial itself is not focused on autism,
     per se, but on "neurodevelopmental" derailments in general.

     4. Look at the original source of information. The source of the
     articles is an editorial, as noted. But one of these articles also
     provides a link to an actual research paper. The paper doesn't even
     address any of the "top 10" chemicals listed but instead is about
     cigarette smoking. News stories about this study describe it as
     linking smoking during pregnancy and autism. Yet the study abstract
     states that they did not identify a link, saying "We found a null
     association between maternal smoking and pregnancy in ASDs and the
     possibility of an association with a higher-functioning ASD subgroup
     was suggested." In other words: No link between smoking and autism.
     But the headlines and how the articles are written would lead you to
     believe otherwise.

   The one rule of Willingham's that I would question is "Ask a
   Scientist", not because it's bad advice, but because it's not something
   most people can easily do. Twitter helps, but only if you're already
   tied into social networks of scientists and science writers. Again,
   most people aren't. If you want to connect to these networks, I'd
   recommend starting out by picking up a copy of The Open Laboratory, an
   annual anthology of the best science writing on the web. Use that to
   find scientists who write for the public and whose voice you enjoy. Add
   them in your social networks, and then add the people that those
   scientists are spending a lot of time talking to. That's the easiest
   way to connect with some trustworthy sources. And remember: An expert
   in one subject is not the same thing as an expert. It doesn't make
   sense to ask a mechanical engineer for their opinion on cancer
   treatments. It doesn't make sense to as an oncologist about building
   better engines.

       "Ask a scientist" can also be misleading advice if the scientist in
       question doesn't have particular expertise in that field. The
       global warming denialist movement is full of people who love to ask
       scientists in the employ of oil companies.

       how about /r/askscience?  asking a scientist is good advice but a
       lot of people have this idea that unless they have a scientist on
       hand to ask, they're hopelessly unable to comprehend "sciency"
       things.
       even a scientist who's not a major in that field may be helpful
       because they know how to read scientific journals and they may know
       what a lot of the jargon means.  however, you don't need an
       advanced degree to think critically.

       I must recommend an excellent source of breaking news stories on
       all scientific fields, [110]Science News, a long standing
       publication. It coveres biology, physics, medicine, astronomy and
       other fields, as well as commentary on the social dimensions and
       consequences of scientific discovery. The articles are written at
       the level of a good newspaper article, and are rigorously
       even-handed. I vzalue it because it is aimed at the curious
       layperson who doesn't have the math background you need to read
       Scientific American.  Science News is also the manager for the
       Intel Science Search, the national highschool science fair that
       identifies [111]the next generation of Nobel winners.

       Just throwing my 2 cents in. I like reading the originating press
       release from the university/research organization (NASA, UCLA,
       National Science Foundation, etc.) Ironically, science press
       releases tend to be about 100x less glammy than the resulting news
       stories. [114]ScienceBlog.com, [115]Phys.org/,
       [116]ScienceDaily.com all cover a lot of similar ground in this
       respect.

            Personally, I'm not actually a huge fan of reading press
            releases like they're news. That's largely because I've done
            several stories over the years where editors handed me a press
            release and said, "Hey, can you go cover this?" My research
            always involved talking to other experts--people in the same
            field who weren't involved in the research the press release
            is about. Nine times out of 10, the press release would turn
            out to be misleading. Not because the way it explains the
            science was wrong (although that happens more often than you
            might think), but because press releases usually leave out SO
            much context in an effort to sell that specific university or
            organization. They really don't give you a very good idea of
            how the new research fits into what's come before, which is
            vital to actually understanding the science. Physorg and
            Science Daily can be really, really misleading because people
            read those press releases and assume that's the whole,
            objective story.
            I've also found that press releases have a tendency to miss
            really interesting and important aspects of stories. Not
            because they're evil or stupid, but because they thought some
            other aspect was going to be the thing that got headlines and
            attention.
            Not saying you shouldn't read press releases, but don't give
            them too much credence.

            I must agree
            with @boingboing-7160c7db52df96e5fe196a6c9ce73f83:disqus ,
            universities and research organizations have someone on staff
            just to handle that sort of publicity and never are they a
            scientist or even someone with a science journalism
            background. Their job is to create positive publicity for the
            university, and so the press releases can be just as bad as
            the news stories.
            When you're a scientist or otherwise involved in science
            (including journalists who go in-depth like Maggie) you'll
            sometimes hear anecdotes from scientists discussing their
            unfortunate meetings with journalists, and especially the
            university publicity person.

                 I disagree. Yes, hyperbole shows up in both. But in my
                 experience it is way, WAY more likely that a newspaper,
                 magazine or blog blows things out of proportion (the most
                 common error I find in science reporting) than a press
                 release will. Typically, the release is tied to the
                 publishing of a peer-reviewed paper, and researchers are
                 keen to keep it fairly straight as a result. And
                 typically, the writer of the press release requires sign
                 off by the researcher before release, specifically
                 because of the complexity of much of the research out
                 there.
                 Now, accurate-but-misleading headlines, on either a news
                 article or press release? That I see a lot.

                      You're right, but while often the press releases are
                      quite good about not exaggerating, the point is you
                      can't always trust university press releases to be
                      that good.
                      I'm only really providing anecdotal evidence -
                      research projects I've been involved with or at
                      least familiar with at the universities I've been at
                      have always been mis-represented in the official
                      university press releases (some more than others of
                      course).
                      The researchers will sign off on them because they
                      don't care enough to waste time getting the PR
                      people to re-write it. It's frustrating working with
                      them. And anyway for the researchers, it's typically
                      not that important if the public doesn't quite
                      understand - they care more about people within the
                      field and those people will be reading the
                      scientific journals not press releases.
                      Again, I agree that the press releases usually are
                      not that bad and are often quite good. But it's a
                      delicate problem - if you don't make it sound
                      exciting, then the general press won't care, but if
                      you make it sound exciting enough for it to get
                      picked up by the press, then you're almost certainly
                      exaggerating at least a bit. Because most day-to-day
                      science is not very exciting :)

       Maggie, you should mention the various science circles floating
       around G+. Yes, there are people who are interested in science in
       those circles, but there are many experts who post regularly and
       wouldn't mind answering questions or giving their 2 cents.

       I would love for people to take this to heart. I have a coworker
       who likes to mention articles as proof for his beliefs but when you
       actually read the paper is does nto support what he is talking
       about at all or weakly asserts that it is lacking in data.
