Camel Milk Woes Rising on MERs Link

   Camels
   The possible link between camels and the MERS-CoV flu has a number of
   Saudis worried. As Arab News reports, camel breeders and herders are
   particularly concerned as their livelihoods could be threatened.

     [95]Link between MERS virus and camels worries breeders
     JEDDAH: RIMA AL-MUKHTAR & RUDOLFO ESTIMO JR.

     Some Saudis are worried that the link between the MERS virus and
     camels is not clear and that it could affect their livelihood as
     sellers of camel milk.

     Yet the connection between Omani camels and a MERS-like virus has
     brought attention to the potential hazards of purchasing camel milk
     that has not been pasteurized.

     "On one of Jeddah roads behind the football stadium you will find
     about three camel herds with their farmers sitting on the side of
     the main road," said Abdulrahman

     Hashim, a medical student. "You can walk up to them and ask them for
     milk and they will sell you some. This is extremely dangerous and
     lack proper hygiene not to mention that it is not safe for those on
     the streets driving their cars."

     Hashim said it appears the camels are not cared for properly.

     "I would step away from taking their milk because we don't know if
     they are clean or healthy so we all should stay away from them and
     other camels until this study [is] fully published and they find a
     cure for them," he added.
     ...

   Saudi Arabia is a great consumer of camel meat and milk. Both have seen
   a resurgence in the marketplace as `good, home-style foodstuffs'.

   Camel milk, traditionally limited to Bedouins, is now showing up in
   boutique ice creams in the cities.

   A piece at Riyadh Connect -- taken from the British medical journal
   `Lancet' -- goes into a better description of what's known and not
   known at present about the linkage between camels and the flu. It's
   speculated that the flu actually arose in Africa -- from which the Gulf
   States, particularly Saudi Arabia -- import large numbers of camels.
   And more surprising, the virus may have transferred to camels as much
   as 18 years ago.

   If this is so, then it has been slowly mutating until it has become a
   disease that can affect humans.
