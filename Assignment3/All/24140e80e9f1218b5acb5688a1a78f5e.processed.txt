   President Obama has gone on an anti-bubble offensive. In a series of
   speeches earlier this month, Obama warned of duplicating policies that
   led to the housing bubble and its inevitable burst. He said he wants a
   Fed chairman who "makes sure that we're not seeing artificial bubbles
   in place," and the next day he spoke of the need to "turn the page on
   the bubble-and-bust mentality."

   Jeremiads against financial "bubbles"--speculative schemes that inflate
   equity prices before a sudden selloff--have been commonplace for nearly
   three centuries. The "bubble" metaphor is often attributed to Jonathan
   Swift, who wrote a poem in December 1720 about the South Sea Bubble,
   which ruined British investors in the South Sea Company: "The nation
   then too late will find,/ Computing all their cost and trouble,/
   Directors' promises but wind,/ South Sea at best a mighty bubble."

   A stroll through historical newspaper databases, however, reveals that
   complaints about "bubbles" filled London journals for a year before
   Swift penned his verse. The South Sea Company, which had been granted a
   monopoly on commerce with Spain's South American colonies, wasn't the
   only source of bubble-bursting. Months earlier, the French economy had
   been thrown into chaos by the Mississippi Scheme of Scottish economist
   John Law, who had become France's controller-general of finances.

   On Dec. 12, 1719, Nathaniel Mist's Weekly Journal published a letter
   from a correspondent calling himself "Anti Bubble." After satirizing
   financial intrigues as "new and old bubble," and even "hubble bubble,"
   he inquires, "Now, good Mr. Journalist, tell us, since Bubbles are so
   much in Fashion, what Bubble will come upon the Stage next? And how
   must an honest Man do among them all, that he may not be bubbled out of
   his Money?"

   Who was the mysterious "Anti Bubble"? All signs point to Swift's
   literary colleague Daniel Defoe, who wrote for Mist's newspaper under
   various pen names. Ross B. Emmett, a professor of political economy at
   Michigan State University and compiler of the three-volume work, "Great
   Bubbles," told me that Defoe's weekly contributions were "full of
   concocted stories" about entrepreneurs manipulating the stock market
   based on false pretenses. But soon Defoe's "bubble" talk came to be
   applied to the real-life schemes of the Mississippi and South Sea
   trading companies.

   It helped that "bubble" was in use as a verb meaning "to cheat." For
   investors bamboozled by promises of great wealth, the noun "bubble" was
   a perfect fit. As Charles Mackay wrote in his 1841 classic,
   "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds," the
   "bubble" nickname was "the most appropriate that imagination could
   devise." And we can evidently thank Defoe's imagination for devising
   it.
