A Sort-of Review of a Sort-of Feminist Manifesto

   [12]book The first red flag for me reading [13]Sheryl Sandberg`s,
   "[14]Lean In," came early in the book. It was page 6 to be exact.  She
   writes,

     "I graduated from college in 1991...The proverbial glass ceiling had
     been cracked in almost every industry, and I believed that it was
     just a matter of time until my generaton took our fair share of the
     leadership roles."

   I wrote in the margin, "1991?"

   On page 14, she further expands on her worldview at the time with this
   statement,

     "When I arrived at college in the fall of 1987, my classmates of
     both genders seemed equally focused on academics.  I don't remember
     thinking about my future career differently from the male students.
      I also don't remember conversations about someday balancing work
     and children.  My friends and I assumed that we would have both."

   And that's when I knew this book was not written for me, or for many
   other women like me.  This is a book Sheryl wrote for her friends.

   I remember 1991.  I was well into my career by then.  A business book
   that hit the bookshelves that year made an irrevocable impression on me
   as a woman, a mother, and particularly, a business professional.  The
   book, "[15]Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women" was
   written by a Wall Street Journal reporter named [16]Susan Faludi.  The
   original copy of that book still sits squarely at the center of my
   bookcase in my office.  Faludi spelled out that year, in pain-staking
   detail (the reference notes alone take up 81 pages in 8-pt type), how
   women were losing on every front.  That this "backlash" had cropped up,
   a counter-reaction if you will, to feminism to "put women back in their
   place."

   [17]Here is Faludi herself talking about the book in 1992.

   [18]Faludi

   Sandberg hardly, I mean hardly, even mentions this book.  There's a
   tacit self-shaming (and I wondered if her editor at [19]Knopf made her
   add this) on page 142 where she admits,

     "I would have denied being in any way, shape or form, a feminist.
     None of my college friends thought of themselves as feminists
     either.  It saddens me to admit that we did not see the backlash
     against women around us."

   She gives a single footnote to Faludi with this line.  Really?  A
   footnote?  Now, like Sandberg, I will state for the record, as she
   does, "I am not a scholar, a journalist, or a sociologist."  I'm only
   writing this review because I told a few people I would not pass
   judgment about the book until after I'd read it.

   I'm not really even sure Sheryl Sandberg read Backlash.  Why would she?
    She had no early indicators that life was going to be tough.  She was
   a good student, daughter of an Ivy League graduate mother and physician
   father.  In high school, between junior and senior year she worked as a
   page for a U.S. Senator.  Getting accepted to Harvard was just the next
   logical step in a trajectory laid out for her and so many like her. So,
   yes. The accusations are legit.  This is a book written by an elitist
   woman who's enjoyed tremendous class and power privileges.

   The mean girl in me thought it might be fun to make some money off the
   Sandberg book by marketing a drinking game you could play at middle
   class BBQs and backyard summer parties.  Everyone could take shots and
   advance around the board when the dice rolled you another privilege
   Sandberg racked up on her career journey.  You'd get bonus points and
   rounds for everyone! every time you opened the book randomly and and
   spotted a 1 percent keyword: [20]Harvard, Google, Facebook, [21]Goldman
   Sachs, [22]Stanford, Treasury Department, [23]Larry Summers,
   [24]McKinsey, etc.

   But, I'm really not a mean girl.  I don't hate Sheryl Sandberg for her
   success, for her book, for her "movement," ...for anything.  In her
   world, she actually did take a brave step and one that was difficult
   for her considering the thwacking she's received already.  It's
   impossible to read this book as a thinking woman without filtering it
   through your own experience.  I know there will be a lot of women who
   don't have the problems ordinary women do, who will use this book as
   ammunition to accelerate their careers and pursue more power.  And, if
   she's right, these women once in power (although not sure I have seen
   any evidence whatsoever that this is true) can begin to address some of
   the drudgery and hardship being an ordinary working woman, wife, and
   mother is. Sandberg addresses this the best she can, from her own
   perspective. I'm rooting for her and her friends to lean in.

   Me?  I'm waiting for the day I'm no longer a case study.  The day I'm
   no longer a data point on some Harvard student's regression analysis
   that compares income with domestic violence.  I'm waiting for the day
   my daughters tell my story, and their daughters tell theirs.  There is
   a day coming where we won't be leaning in, we will be falling over
   ourselves with equal pay, rights, reproductive choices, gender
   preferences, executive access, and celebrating our own battle-worn
   victories.

   Sheryl is doing her part, and me and my female friends (professionals,
   SAHMs, gay, straight, single with kids, single/married without kids,
   and so on), we're doing ours.   What we lack in marketing budget, we
   make up in large numbers.  And we're not [25]roaring anymore; we're
   mostly yawning. But, we're making that better world happen.  Every
   damned day.

       Susan: I was excited to read your take on this book. I myself was
       ecstatic to read it, after her TED talk (which I LOVED) I thought
       for sure this book would be all inspiring, I even pre-ordered it. I
       actually gave up about half way through because it just didn't seem
       to have the substance/ practical advice I was looking for. I
       actually believe that I got everything relevant from her TED talk,
       and that this book was an attempt to turn a 1 hour speech into a
       couple hundred page book. (Didn't seem to work well)
       Because you mentioned Backlash, a book that left such a mark on you
       earlier in your career, I wanted to share my version of that book.
       It is called Think: Straight Talk for Women to Stay Smart in a
       Dumbed-Down World by Lisa Bloom. This book made quite the
       impression on me, I find myself quoting it often, and it has truly
       inspired me to read and "think" more often to make myself an
       intelligent member of society.
       Thanks for sharing your honest perspective.

       Thanks for the comment Shannon. Sorry I just saw it today! Need to
       fix my notifications on this blog. Your observation about the
       "TEDtalk turned into a book" is right on the money. (Maybe pun
       intended.) I will definitely check out the Bloom book. I miss our
       all-girl group in the Hive! Maybe we could recreate that on the
       Jive community? I'll talk to Gia Lyons about it. Thanks for
       dropping by.

            I like that idea- please invite me should that every manifest.
            I know Tori is looking to create a sort of "women in business
            book club" so any suggestions on great books we'd love to hear
            them.

                 Thanks Shannon. We are setting up the women group on the
                 Jive community. See you there!
