New York City Metro chapter: Ben Goldacre

   [spacer.gif]

   02/20/13     New York, NY

   Dr. Ben Goldacre Ben Goldacre ([85]@bengoldacre), a physician, is
   author of the best-selling book "Bad Science" and the new book "Bad
   Pharma," which is already making waves around the globe. Goldacre's
   [86]website says he specializes in "unpicking dodgy scientific claims
   from drug companies, newspapers, government reports, PR people and
   quacks. Unpicking bad science is the best way to explain good
   science." Goldacre has been writing the Bad Science column in the
   Guardian since 2003, has been interviewed by many news outlets and even
   performs at comedy clubs. His latest campaign, his biggest ever, is
   [87]AllTrials.net, which is seeking to have all clinical trials
   registered, all summary results reported, and full Clinical Study
   Reports made publicly available.
   This is an event you won't want to miss.

   Wednesday, Feb. 20, 6 p.m.
   The World Room, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism
   [88]116th and Broadway (right off the 1 train) | [89]Directions
   Books will be available for purchase on site and Goldacre can sign them
   there, as well.

   Please RSVP to Trudy Lieberman at [90]Trudy.Lieberman@gmail.com.
