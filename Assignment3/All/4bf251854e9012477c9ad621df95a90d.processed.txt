[4]Peer review without journals or conferences

   Almost all scientists ask their peers to review their work outside of
   the formal process offered by journals and conferences. Young
   scientists are routinely told to take their manuscripts to a senior
   scientist and ask for a review.

   With some success, I have even used my blog as a peer review device:
   e.g., we received many comments on our manuscript on [5]fast integer
   decoding through a blog post I wrote. If you read some of my recent
   research articles, you will find that I acknowledge people who
   commented on this blog. (I have even ended up writing papers with some
   of them, but that is a different story.) In effect, my blog has helped
   me get extra reviews for some of my work! I couldn't be more grateful!

   I am not really interested in making journals and conferences go away,
   but I am interested in going beyond them. I fear that they are often
   limiting us:
     * In fields such as computer science, limiting the review to journals
       and conferences effectively cuts most non-academics out. They are
       also limiting the review to a narrow band of experts. If you are
       trying to solve problems that matter, this might be entirely wrong.
     * Traditional peer review is anonymous. In principle, this makes it
       fair and transparent. In practice, it can be needlessly alienating.
       For example, I would much rather have an open exchange with some
       authors that I criticize rather than just send an anonymous note.
       We might both benefit from the exchange. One pattern I have noticed
       is that some of my (well meaning) comments get ignored. Even when
       they require little work and can only benefit the authors. We have
       put walls in the peer review process, and there are good reasons
       for these walls, but we could do without them if we reinvented the
       process.

   Hence, I have launched an open invitation to the world: send me your
   drafts, and if I find them interesting, I will review them and then
   tell the world about them (through social networks) if you revise them
   to my satisfaction.

   My goal is not to replace journals and conferences all by myself, but I
   do see a growing trend whereas people point to papers that have not yet
   been peer reviewed and say: I read this, it looks good to me! I'd like
   more people to participate in this new emerging model.

   Anyhow, so far, only one courageous fellow agreed with my terms:
   Nathanaël Schaeffer sent me his paper [6]Efficient Spherical Harmonic
   Transforms aimed at pseudo-spectral numerical simulations. I wrote a
   review, the same way I would for a journal, and I sent it to him. He
   produced a revised version that took into account my criticism. I am
   now telling you that if you care for spherical harmonic transforms,
   [7]you should definitively check out his paper.

   So where does that leave us?
     * If you are a researcher, and you would be willing to review
       manuscripts openly the way I did, please let the world know!
     * If you think your work could interest me and you want to try a
       different type of peer review, please send me your paper!
     * If one of [8]my papers interests you and you want to write a review
       and share it with me, please do! I also have [9]software that needs
       reviewing.

   I stress that you do not need to be affiliated with a college or have
   researcher as your title for this model to work. Anyone can write or
   review a research paper. (Admittedly, few people can write good papers
   or produce deep reviews but that is another story.)

   I am not sure exactly how far we can go with such open peer review
   processes. But I think we can improve the current system significantly.
   To make my point stronger, I plan to write a blog post describing how I
   benefited from reviews and criticisms I have received through my blog
   and social networks. For now, please believe me: I received insights
   that I would never had received through the traditional peer review
   process.

    1. I completely agree with your idea of engaging reviewers in a
       dialog. There's a lot of mis-understandings that happen with blind
       reviews and I would often have preferred transparency both as a
       submitter and as a reviewer.
       But I'm a little worried by your proposal - if it takes off.
       Suppose everyone did this, including Peter Norvig. Now, say I have
       this cool idea for fast integer decoding - who am I going to send
       it first: Norvig or Lemire? A simple game theoretical analysis says
       Norvig, even though Lemire is clearly the better choice. Why?
       Because Norvig might get me a high-paying job with a cool company
       and has thousands more Twitter followers than Lemire.
       I think that keeping the function that journal editors play as
       "switchboards" for peer-matchups might still be better than "send
       me your draft, and I'll advertise your paper if you revise it to my
       satisfaction." We just need to change how journals work.

       In the future I imagine, you'd seek a reviewer for your latest
       manuscript, maybe using some kind of computer-assisted process.
       You'd obviously want your reviewers to be as well known and as
       influential as possible. But this is actually a good thing!
       I don't imagine this would replace journals. It is more about going
       beyond journals.
       That's like saying "YouTube won't replace TV channels". No, it
       won't.

       By the way, though I can only guess, I suspect that Norvig might be
       open to something like I describe. Google has not focused its
       research on journals and conferences.

    4. I see a business opportunity: an "E-harmony" for matching authors
       and reviewers. A technology development opportunity for a better
       kind of recommender too - reviewers could be "rated" and
       recommended across different dimensions (subject matter knowledge /
       detail of reviews / helpfulness). Authors could be rated according
       to how finished their submissions are (I hate it when I get a
       poorly written submission with mistakes everywhere in order to get
       free proof-reading)....

    5. Could it be built upon [22]http://arxaliv.org/ ?
       It's already there and it's open source.
       In my opinion we would (at the very least) need to (1)
       differentiate (i.e. givign different weigths) between pseudonym and
       "real name" users and (2) differentiate between pure up/downvote
       and actual reviews/comments.

    6. Yes I am very much interested in this.
       Open reviews. Reviews of reviewers. Some closed reviews if really
       needed. Repositories/versioning for papers.
       At the end only citations really count. Reviewers can help a paper
       get better IF there is no competition. Ideally... but we all know
       this is not true.
       So better leave it to the judgement of the masses. Crowdsource
       reviews and comments.
       At the end only the number of citations and impact of the paper
       really count.
       I wrote about this also here:
