   Tuesday was a big day for [48]Apple.

   The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is set to ship its [49]700
   millionth iOS device next month and held an event at its headquarters
   to show off its new products and the next generation of its mobile
   software, iOS 7.

   If you missed out on our [51]live blog during the event, here's a quick
   rundown on all of Apple's big announcements.

iOS 7

   [52]iOS7_edited-1

   By now, you have probably seen a glimpse of iOS 7, which was officially
   announced during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference ([53]WWDC) in
   June. On Tuesday, Apple revealed that it would release the new
   operating system on Sept. 18.

   Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering at
   Apple, provided an overview of some of the new features we can expect
   with iOS 7, including a new Control Center, Notification Center and
   multitasking view. He also showed off some new ringtones for the
   operating system and new system alert sounds.

   A new "Share Sheet" within iOS 7 makes it easy to share content with
   friends on [54]Twitter and other social networks, and AirDrop lets you
   virtually drop files onto a friend's iPhone nearby.

   iTunes Radio [55]will also launch with iOS 7 on Sept. 18.

   Check out [56]our hands-on with iOS 7 for a more in-depth look at the
   new operating system.

Two New iPhones

   [57]jxyh3LEegskRliMLRAlihAJB7_JW55hOuzuqzvF3wuA

   As expected, Apple also announced two new iPhones: the iPhone 5S and
   5C. Both phones will be available in stores on Sept. 20, and you can
   preorder the 5C starting Sept. 13.

   The [58]iPhone 5S will be available in silver, gold and space gray,
   which looks a lot like this year's black. The phone has a new A7
   processor re-engineered for 64-bit architecture, translating to a much
   faster phone -- one that's capable of running much more complex
   software.

   One example shown on stage was Epic Game's [59]Infinity Blade III,
   which uses the company's Unreal Engine to create exceptionally
   immersive and vivid gameplay on mobile.

   The handset boasts an improved camera with a f/2.2 aperture for taking
   better photos in low light as well as a dual-LED flash for creating the
   perfect natural color balance in shots. A panorama mode can take a
   28-megapixel shot, and a new burst mode snaps 10 still pictures in one
   second.

   A [60]fingerprint scanner on the phone's home button can be used in
   place of the traditional passcode for the phone. Owners can also use it
   the scanner to sign into iTunes to buy apps and media.

   [61]Apple-event-175

   The phone is the same price as the current iPhone 5: $199 for the 16GB
   version, $299 for 32GB and $399 for 64GB.

   The 5C has many of the same capabilities as the iPhone 5, but the rear
   of the 5C is replaced by a single piece of colored polycarbonate. The
   iPhone 5C will come in vibrant green, blue, pink, yellow and white, and
   will be priced at $100 less than the current iPhone 5, starting at $99
   for the 16GB version.

   [62]lLa20xWomb3orM5z2bM88QUFqx6vzlbp9Uv62n8qbr4

   Apple offers cases for both phones. For the 5S, you can purchase
   leather cases in subdued colors that cover the volume buttons on the
   phone for $49. The 5C has more vibrantly colored cases with rows of
   holes cut out on the back to allow the phone's color to shine through
   for $29.

   With the launch of the phones Apple has discontinued the iPhone 5. The
   iPhone 4S will still remain available as a free phone with a new
   two-year contract.

Free Apps

   [63]MdOEr5hbFF21zLPTRgT2uSjG7KVGNzZixOUmDxbac1g

   Apple made [64]several of its popular apps free on Tuesday, too. Now,
   whenever you purchase a new iPhone, [65]iPad or fifth-generation iPod
   touch, you can download iWork, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, iPhoto and
   iMovie for free. These apps are normally priced between $4.99 and $9.99
   each.

   Do you plan to purchase an iPhone 5S or 5C? Let us know your thoughts
   in the comments.
