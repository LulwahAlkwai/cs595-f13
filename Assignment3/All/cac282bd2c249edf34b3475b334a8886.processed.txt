Symposium on Visions of the Theory of Computing

   May 29 - May 31, 2013
   [48]View schedule & video »
   Organizers:
   [49]Richard Karp (UC Berkeley), [50]Christos Papadimitriou (UC
   Berkeley), [51]Alistair Sinclair (UC Berkeley).

To view the link for a video or slides, click on the title of the talk in the
[52]schedule.

   This three-day symposium will bring together distinguished speakers and
   participants from the Bay Area and all over the world to celebrate both
   the excitement of fundamental research on the Theory of Computing, and
   the accomplishments and promise of computational research in effecting
   progress in other sciences -- the two pillars of the Institute's
   research agenda.

Note

   This symposium immediately precedes [53]STOC, which runs June 1-4, 2013
   in Palo Alto, California.
