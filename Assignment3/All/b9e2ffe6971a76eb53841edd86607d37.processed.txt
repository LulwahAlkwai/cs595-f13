[11]Dan Ferber Journalist

Writing about science, technology, health, and the environment

Classes

   Dan teaches a science-writing class occasionally through [12]Freelance
   Success, an online community of professional freelance writers.

   Science writing: How to strengthen your writing with science.
   NEXT CLASS: JULY 2 - AUGUST 6, 2012

   Fascinated by science, but confused by the sea of scientific studies?
   Want to use science to add punch to your pieces? Want to know how to
   figure out if a study is worth covering, or how to make sense of it
   quickly? You don't need a Ph.D. to write well about science. By
   learning some basics about how science works in the real world and what
   makes scientific information newsworthy, you can add substance and
   credibility to your work.

   This online class covers:
     * the best places to find science news
     * how to find the right expert, not just the nearest expert
     * how to quickly vet a study
     * the art of explaining science
     * narrative science writing
     * pitching science stories

   The class will feature readings, lessons and assignments, which will be
   posted and discussed in a password-protected forum. Several readings
   will be drawn from A Field Guide for Science Writers, a how-to book
   from the National Association of Science Writers that costs about $20.

   Dan Ferber is an award-winning journalist whose writing on science,
   technology, health and sustainability has appeared in Reader's Digest,
   Popular Science, Wired, Scientific American, Audubon, Nature
   Conservancy, Women's Health and many other publications. He's a
   correspondent for Science magazine, the coauthor of the award-winning
   book, Changing Planet, Changing Health, and an adjunct instructor of
   journalism at Indiana University.

   $249 for Freelance Success members, $299 for nonmembers. Registration
   is limited to 20 students. To register, email Dan at

   Testimonials from previous students:

   "Dan Ferber's science writing class gave me the boost I needed to take
   my writing where I wanted it to go. Ferber challenges each writer to
   analyze scientific studies, hone interview techniques and find
   appropriate sources. His suggestions on building narratives put into
   practice what makes a good science story.  He is a generous teacher
   giving support and sharing insights. What a pleasure it is to learn
   from this experienced professional." -- Mary Klest

   "Dan Ferber teaches a focused, upbeat and highly informative course on
   science writing. The course is equally beneficial to experienced
   science writers as well as those just entering the field."-- Bill
   Clapper

   "Incredibly helpful. Well written and thorough course materials and an
   insightful look at the narrative aspect of science writing. The course
   definitely took my casting for ideas and the actual writing of science
   stories to the next level. Dan, thank you again. I really loved the
   class and the effort you put into it." -- Jean Thilmany

   "I have been writing about health and medicine for consumer
   publications for many years and took Dan Ferber's science writing
   course to get a clearer understanding of how to interpret study data
   and statistics and to learn other approaches to science writing. The
   course was clear, well organized and very productive. I would recommend
   it to anyone who is interested in science writing." -- Peggy Noonan

   "This was the best writing class ever and Dan is an exceptional
   teacher. I evolved into a science writer without having those first
   important journalism courses, which left me without an understanding of
   some fundamental things science writers must know. Because of my lack
   of understanding, I have been functioning under a low ceiling of
   opportunity. Dan patiently answered my countless questions, lifting
   that ceiling and opening a door that had been closed to me before.
   Further, he helped me to understand that learning to write really is a
   process and doesn't happen overnight. While indeed there are born
   storytellers among us, even those of us who struggle telling stories
   can move somewhat along that continuum, perhaps, because of the road
   plan he so kindly provided. This class was exceptional in so many ways.
   I think Dan should consider being a writing coach, in addition to a
   freelance writer! -- Pat McAdams

   "My only disappointment about Dan's class was that it came to an end.
   If he offered a follow-up class, I'd sign up immediately. I'm new to
   science writing, and can't imagine getting a better introduction to
   this area; Dan is a wise, generous guide. The class title doesn't quite
   do it justice, however. You may think, 'Oh, this class won't do me any
   good, because I'm never going to write about science stuff.' And that's
   too bad -- because Dan's course content delivers so much more than
   'science stuff.' For example, the class addresses approaches to
   research, reporting and narrative writing that I'll apply to an array
   of topics. That said, his class definitely piqued my enthusiasm for
   pursuing science stories." -- Sandra Swanson

   "Dan is extremely knowledgeable about the nuts and bolts of science
   writing, and has a great deal of enthusiasm for it. He is generous with
   his time, guiding students through core concepts patiently and giving
   thoughtful, valuable feedback to their questions." -- Wendy Lyons
   Sunshine

   "The Science Writing Course was a great investment. Dan's a first-class
   instructor with a knack for making complicated material easy to
   understand. The readings, homework assignments and discussions helped
   stretch my thinking in new ways. I'm looking forward to putting all
   I've learned into practice." -- Jodi Torpey

   "Dan is so knowledgeable about science writing and teaches the
   information with such ease. I am leaving the class knowing that I can
   add this to my writer's tool box and reap the benefits." --Andrea King
   Collier

   "Great course by a well informed instructor who is very forgiving of
   those of us who don't know as much." --Dorothy Pederson
