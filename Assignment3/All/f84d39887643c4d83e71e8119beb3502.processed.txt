   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   Anticipating World War III< Cyber risk (and risk someone will
   overreact) of a Missile Attack on Syria
   What I found very troubling was when the Syrian army clearly fired a
   warning shot with their broad attacks on media and social networking
   sites (apparently a far broader attack than was initially reported) few
   seemed to get that this was a warning shot. We know our electrical grid
   is not only not secure it is incredibly fragile suggesting an attack,
   if successful, could easily accidentally cascade across the nation.
   After I wrote the linked piece the administration moved for
   congressional approval and politicians generally only do this when they
   want to spread blame, otherwise they want solo credit, suggesting the
   administration knows the risk they are taking. I list things you can do
   to get ready for what will likely be a devastating counter attack
   should we fire missiles at Syria. By the way, this kind of attack,
   particularly with for warning not only will likely not work but on
   chemical weapons could create a regional catastrophe where blame would
   fall on the US, and likely the cost of the cleanup. The subject of my
   Monday column on TechNewsWorld:
