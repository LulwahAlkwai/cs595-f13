Bose QuietComfort 20i Review

    1. P9120006

Noise Cancellation Goes Small, With Big Convenience
       Bose's QuietComfort 20i ($299.95) earphones adapt the company's
       noise-cancellation tech is an extremely compact design. The earbuds
       even have an "Aware" mode that switches off the noise cancellation
       without interrupting your music.
    2. P9120001

In-Line Battery
       The battery for the earbuds is in-line with the cable, very close
       to the jack. The best part is that the earphones will still work
       when you run out of juice, albeit without noise cancellation.
    3. P9120004

Design
       The QC20i earphones fit on your outer ear -- so they're not
       actually an in-ear design. That gives the acoustics a little more
       to work with in terms of the amount of air they can move.
    4. P9070001

Snug Fit
       The rubberized "wings" of the earbuds provide a snug fit in your
       ear, without the discomfort of having something actually in your
       ear.
    5. P9040004

Controls
       Controls for playback, as well as a microphone (for taking calls),
       are on a smaller in-line unit closer to the earbuds themselves.

   I must admit: I'm a fan of [49]Bose's around-ear noise-cancelling
   headphones. Despite their bulk, I pack the QuietComfort 2 headset and
   additional AAA batteries in my carry-on for all my trips -- whether
   they're via planes, trains, or budget bus lines.

   I still take my in-ear headset for ease of use; once I'm at my
   destination I don't want to plop on big cans for a quickie phone call.
   The [50]QuietComfort 20i will change that, though, since it combines
   Bose's noise-canceling technology with in-ear design.

   The hush of Bose's noise canceling technology is a wonderful thing.
   Whether it's muting the roar of a subway or a jet engine, the hum of
   motor traffic, or the white noise of an office, the sound of quiet is
   in and of itself an improvement over standard headphones.

   The in-ear QC 20i headphones could double as sleeping aids, fitting
   snugly into the ear holes (three tips sizes, included, fit all), with
   winged attachments anchoring them within the inner lobe. Flipping the
   switch on the attached battery (which also holds the exterior noise
   sensor) fills your aural cavities with a blankness deeper than earplugs
   alone could provide.

   Add on to this resonant bass and clear medium and high tones for sweet,
   sweet music -- and only music -- to travel to.

   To accomplish this feat of audio engineering, Bose has placed the
   mini-USB rechargeable battery pack on the device end of the headset's
   cable. This is only slightly awkward, as it means the pack-of-gum-sized
   attachment may dangle outside of the pocket with the iPhone already in
   it.

   Otherwise, the headset looks a lot like the company's [52]MIE2i
   headphones: The inline mic/remote control are the same, with the sole
   addition of a button for "Aware" mode (see below). A tiny clip for
   attaching to clothing stabilizes the thing -- which is essential, as
   jostling of the earphones will produce more noise than over-ear
   headphones do.

   The rechargeable battery is a convenience that means no extra expense
   for AAAs. And in contrast to the over-ear noise-canceling headphones,
   the QC20i headset will still play music when the battery runs out
   (which happens after about 12 hours) -- only the noise-canceling won't
   work.

   Similarly, switching the less cancel-y "Aware" mode via the inline
   remote allows ambient sound to creep in, so there's less likelihood of
   being hit by a bus when walking through traffic.

   Bose's QC 20i earbuds have become my default go-to headphones,
   particularly as I can go semi-blocked with the in-between mode --
   thereby limiting my chances of being caught unawares.

The Lowdown

   What's Good
     * Excellent noise cancellation
     * Comfortable, secure fit
     * Deep bass, solid range
     * Still work when the battery expires

   What's Bad
     * Not cheap ($299.95)

   Bottom Line: Although Bose has shrunk noise-canceling headphones with
   the QuietComfort 20i, it hasn't compromised on sound, and it's added an
   excellent new layer of convenience with Aware mode.
