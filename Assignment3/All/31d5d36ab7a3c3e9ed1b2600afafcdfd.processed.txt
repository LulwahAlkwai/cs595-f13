   PRESS RELEASE

Cisco Announces Intent to Acquire WHIPTAIL

Acquisition Strengthens Cisco's Unified Computing System Strategy with
Integration of High Performance Solid State Memory Systems


   SAN JOSE, Calif. - Sept. 10, 2013 - Cisco today announced its intent to
   acquire privately held WHIPTAIL, a leader in high performance, scalable
   solid state memory systems that enable organizations to simplify data
   center and virtualized environments and process more data in less time.
   Based in Whippany, N.J., WHIPTAIL will strengthen Cisco's Unified
   Computing System(TM) (UCS) strategy and enhance application performance
   by integrating scalable solid state memory into the UCS's fabric
   computing architecture.

   New breeds of applications such as virtual desktops and data analytics
   are imposing increased performance demands on traditional storage array
   systems. Bridging the gap between increased application performance
   demand from servers and what traditional storage systems can deliver,
   requires that solid state memory systems be brought closer to the
   application. With the acquisition of WHIPTAIL Cisco is evolving the UCS
   architecture by integrating data acceleration capability into the
   compute layer. Integrating WHIPTAIL's memory systems with UCS at a
   hardware and manageability level will simplify customers' data center
   environments by delivering the required performance in a fraction of
   the data center floor space with unified management for provisioning
   and administration.

   "We are focused on providing a converged infrastructure including
   compute, network and high performance solid state that will help
   address our customers' requirements for next-generation computing
   environments," said Paul Perez, vice president and general manager,
   Cisco Computing Systems Product Group.  "As we continue to innovate our
   unified platform, WHIPTAIL will help realize our vision of scalable
   persistent memory which is integrated into the server, available as a
   fabric resource and managed as a globally shared pool."

   UCS's architectural advantages such as built-in automation and high
   performance fabrics complement WHIPTAIL's high performance data
   services. UCS and WHIPTAIL, together with Cisco Nexus® data center
   switches, will accelerate Cisco innovation and momentum in the
   converged infrastructure.

   Upon completion of the acquisition, WHIPTAIL employees will be
   integrated into the Computing Systems Product Group led by Paul Perez,
   vice president and general manager. Under the terms of the agreement,
   Cisco will pay approximately $415 million in cash and retention-based
   incentives in exchange for all shares of WHIPTAIL. The acquisition of
   WHIPTAIL is expected to be complete in the first quarter of fiscal year
   2014, subject to customary closing conditions.
