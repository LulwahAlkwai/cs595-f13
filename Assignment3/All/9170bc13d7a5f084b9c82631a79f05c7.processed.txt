Meet Kevin Weil: Twitter's Ad Architect and Its Killer App

Data Scientist Helping Social-Media Service Speak to Madison Avenue

   In an earlier life, Kevin Weil was a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford in
   theoretical particle physics. Today, as Twitter steams toward a public
   offering, the 30-year-old ultramarathoner is playing a surprisingly
   central role in turning Twitter into a key platform for advertisers --
   and, in turn, a profitable business.
   Kevin Weil
   Kevin Weil

   Mr. Weil had no advertising experience before landing at Twitter in
   2009 as a data scientist, yet he is creating the products that make the
   social-media company money. (It's poised to rake in close to $600
   million this year, according to a recent [171]eMarketer estimate.) When
   most people think of Twitter as a business, they think of Chief Revenue
   Officer Adam Bain, but it's Mr. Weil who builds the products Mr. Bain
   sells. Mr. Weil played a key role in the acquisition of TV-analytics
   startup [172]BlueFin Labs and was just last week named a VP at the
   2,000-employee company.

   He's an engineer with deep technical expertise and the ability to lead
   a big team. But he also has something pretty rare in Silicon Valley:
   the ability to speak fluently in the tongue of marketers. "It's very
   rare that you find someone who has that EQ/IQ balance in engineering,"
   said Lauren Crampsie, [173]Ogilvy & Mather's chief marketing officer.

   "He really proved himself to be Twitter's secret weapon on the
   monetization front," said Mr. Bain.

   Mr. Weil was originally hired as the engineering lead for Twitter's
   analytics team following stints at small tech firms after he left his
   Stanford Ph.D. program to find work that felt more contemporary than
   the study of the universe's formation. When Twitter began developing
   promoted tweets almost three years ago, he became product lead for the
   revenue team, largely because of his immersion in Twitter's data sets
   and grasp of the stories they tell about what makes users happy.

   Age's Digital Conference, Oct. 15 in San Francisco. [174]More info.

   Now Mr. Weil is playing a much more visible -- and public -- role at
   the company. He's increasingly being called upon to lead outside of it
   as well, which entails meetings with marketers and agencies and his
   first trip this year to Cannes.

   Mr. Bain recalled a meeting in New York in late 2011 with Subway CMO
   Tony Pace and a discussion about how to promote Subway endorser and
   gold-medalist speed skater Apolo Ohno on Twitter. It emerged that Mr.
   Ohno was running a marathon during the coming weekend, and Mr. Pace
   asked Mr. Weil to run with Mr. Ohno. (Mr. Weil agreed on the condition
   that he be allowed to live-tweet the run.)

     Congrats team SUBWAY on finishing the [175]#NYCMarathon!
     [176]@ApoloOhno [177]@TRTLA [178]@KevinWeil [179]@Elizabeth Just
     under your goal time!
     -- SUBWAY Restaurants (@SUBWAY) [180]November 6, 2011

   "Adam [Bain] speaks a lot to marketers directly," said Mr. Weil. "But
   there's a parallel story about the way we develop advertising products,
   the user focus we bring to it -- that we only want to show an ad to
   users if it's great. We're trying to take the market in that direction,
   that advertising can be a great experience."

   Twitter ads have also become increasingly sophisticated. Recent product
   launches include targeting for marketers to show Twitter ads to people
   [181]who've already seen their TV ads and a measurement program with
   the data giant [182]Datalogix to gauge the [183]offline sales lift for
   consumer packaged goods marketers that advertise on Twitter.

   At Twitter's San Franciso headquarters, Mr. Weil has 15 product
   managers who report to him. They sit with roughly 130 engineers along
   with the sales team, and that's by design. "It's the absolute best way
   to understand how our products are performing and what we need to do to
   make them better," said Mr. Weil. He also described himself as "joined
   at the hip" to Mr. Bain.

   Twitter's revenue team has always been fairly autonomous, but the
   company's organizational structure now shows an even higher degree of
   confidence in Mr. Weil. He previously reported to Othman Laraki,
   Twitter's VP-growth, until the latter left the company at the end of
   last year. Now he's on Twitter CEO Dick Costolo's executive team along
   with company heavyweights like Mr. Bain, chief operating officer Ali
   Rowghani, and VP-product Michael Sippey, Mr. Weil's counterpart for the
   user side of the Twitter product.

   Chris Sacca, a venture capitalist and Twitter investor, observed that
   Mr. Weil was hired from the startup Cooliris without any massive
   expectation of him becoming an executive. Now he's one of the most
   senior. "There was a vote of confidence made that he doesn't need a
   boss," said Mr. Sacca.

   Mr. Weil is a fierce evangelist of Twitter in private settings, too.
   Ms. Crampsie initially befriended Mr. Weil by writing back and forth on
   Twitter and went on vacation to Sonoma, Calif. with him, his wife,
   Elizabeth -- a former Twitter executive and fellow ultramarathoner
   who's now a partner at Andreessen Horowitz -- and her own husband
   earlier this year. Mr. Weil got into a discussion with the tech
   neophyte owner of a winery they were visiting and proceeded to set up
   his Twitter account and walk him through using it.

   "Wherever he is, he's always looking to enhance the product and talk to
   people about it," she said.
