[20]Science Crowdfunding in the Boston Globe

   3 September, 2013

   There's a nice piece in the Boston Globe today about science
   crowdfunding - covering #SciFund, Kenly Hiller's great proposal, and
   crowdfunding in general. Check it out!

[22]More than Money

   5 August, 2013

   Today's post is about how having a crowdfunding project, such as
   Serengeti Live from R2 of #SciFund, can lead to opportunities larger
   than you may have ever imagined. If it inspired you, check out the
   current effort to Save Snapshot Serengeti and kick a few bucks to this
   #SciFund alum that is doing amazing science! [...]

[24]The Process of Science Crowdfunding in one Picture

   23 July, 2013

   After all of the R1 analysis, Dr. Zen created a wonderful infographic
   summarizing our results of how we thought science crowdfunding worked.
   Now that we've moved forward with our R2 and R3 analysis that bring
   effort to the table, and slightly modify the story, he has again graced
   us with a truly awesome infographic to [...]

[26]Eternal youth, cancer and telomeres.

   26 September, 2013

   In the Fireside Science series - SciFund Challenge's Guide to Life, the
   Universe and Everything! This is an edited version of a post in my blog
   - chromosomesandcancer.com. The back-story is that I was approached by
   a national current affairs program to do an interview on telomeres.
   Being a cancer researcher I thought the story [...]

[28]A diagram of a cell, "Up-Goer Five" style

   18 September, 2013

   Participating in this year's SciFund course got me thinking about ways
   to make science attractive to a broader audience. As Josh Witten
   pointed out in a recent post on Nature's SoapBox Science blog, our
   message is not being heard by a huge segment of the population if we
   focus only on the small audience that [...]

[32]#SciFund Crowdfunding Goals and Success

   28 August, 2013

   Recently, I was asked some questions about Goals for #SciFund
   participants that I hadn't investigated since round 1. Namely, what's
   do people usually ask for? Which of course led me in a few directions.
   First, what do folk ask for? The mean ask is $3356.33 with the median
   at $2500 over all three rounds. Or, [...]

[34]The First Fruits of #SciFund

   28 June, 2013

   We've just gotten notice of the first paper published acknowledging
   support from #SciFund supporters! Walter Weare's Round 1 project,
   Artificial Photosynthesis at NCSU was a nice modest first project. It
   was succesful, and now some of the funded work has been published at
   the New Journal of Chemistry in a piece entitled meso-Pyridyl BODIPYs
   with [...]

[36]How much can you get with science crowdfunding? How about ONE MILLION
DOLLARS!

   27 June, 2013

   Since the very start of #SciFund the biggest critique we get is, "Yeah,
   sure, this may work for your summer of research for folks who don't
   need the big bucks, but *real* science costs hundreds of thousands, or
   millions of dollars! You'll never get that. Therefore, science
   crowdfunding is a waste of time, Q.E.D." (ok, [...]

[38]ONS Course - Module 4: Expanding the open notebook.

   27 June, 2013

   No single web platform has every capability that you could want/need in
   your notebook. This is why your choice in notebook software needs to be
   a versatile system, and is the reason why we chose to work with
   WordPress. WordPress has a ton of features and if there isn't a feature
   that you need, there [...]
