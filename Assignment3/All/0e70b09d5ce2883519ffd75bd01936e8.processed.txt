[68]The EMD Update: Google Issues "Weather Report" Of Crack Down On Low
Quality Exact Match Domains

   Sep 28, 2012 at 5:05pm ET by [69]Barry Schwartz

   The head of Google web spam fighting team Matt Cutts [72]announced on
   Twitter that Google will be rolling out a "small" algorithm change that
   will "reduce low-quality `exact-match' domains" from showing up so
   highly in the search results.

   Cutts said this will impact 0.6% of English-US queries to a noticeable
   degree. He added it is "unrelated to Panda/Penguin. [73]Panda is a
   Google algorithm filter aimed at fighting low quality content;
   [74]Penguin is one aimed at fighting web spam.

   This should come as no surprise, as Cutts said a [75]couple years ago
   that Google will be looking at why exact domain matches rank well when
   they shouldn't, in some cases.

   Likely over the coming days, you will see shifts in the search results
   where many sites that may rank well based on being an exact match
   domain may no longer rank as high in Google's search results.

   Exact match domains mean domains that match exactly for the search
   query. For example, if I sold blue widgets and owned the domain name
   www.bluewidgets.com, that would be an exact match domain.

   Keep in mind that this doesn't mean sites with keywords they hope to
   rank for in their domain names are now doomed. Rather, the change aims
   to target low quality sites that might be riding on on the basis of
   exact matching.

   For a broader perspective on Google algorithm updates, see [76]The
   Return of the Google Dance on our sister site, Marketing Land. As for
   ranking factors overall, be sure to see our [77]Periodic Table Of SEO
   Ranking Factors.

       Likewise, I own a site where quality pages with word counts around
       1500 to 2000 or more words, getting a large amount of natural FB
       `likes', linked to a popular YouTube account with links back to the
       relevant pages and the videos embedded on said pages. Yet also the
       site has as far as I can tell disappeared from Google, the only
       reason I know it hasn't gone completely is because I ran the
       "site:xxxxxx" query, all my search traffic from Google has
       disappeared though. I only use ethical SEO, on page etc, and have
       steered clear of black hat like the plague for numerous reasons.
       I will get the site up and running effectively again, it just kind
       of sucks for this to happen after months of work.

       Google guys have gone a step too far with experimentation. My own
       site got hit despite being using all high quality content. It is
       now gone from page 1 to page 20.... I don't understand what to-do
       now....all traffic is gone along with business.....guess would have
       to start from scratch and again spend few months....

       The word has been out for some time that EMD where googles next
       target its all about giving and doing what Google wants! I have
       quite a few smaller sites and many took a hit still deciding if its
       worth building them up or just letting them go, however a couple of
       my larger sites did improve which makes me think it might be worth
       the effort to give one or two a go!!

       As I've said, its only an excerpt of the mail. It's not a comment
       on the post in public. Its an email. In fact, they privately shared
       their work to me and allow me to examine if they have done their
       work right..They asked detailed questions and I've answer them.
       They even shared my post on their own social networking profile,
       and I've checked it. I even earn new readers from them and right
       now the site after these updates even had higher percent amount of
       returning visitors than new visitors.

       I have a branded domain, my competitors have exact match domains. I
       just received my SEOMOZ report today... all the exact match domain
       competitors have gone up in rankings. Gah!

       Hi Leodeen, Don't give up - my site got flushed and I've made some
       changes and clawed my way back up to Page 1... I wrote an article
       here about what I did:

       ...and now non-sniper sites, which have a relevant domain are
       knocked out the rankings. They will need to tweak this to reclaim
       the ground lost by these sites - looked a little too much of a
       harsh update.
     * le-man-nguyen
       That mean that Google always is trying to provide quality results
       for user

       It uses poor quality domain name is identical the new keyword
       ranking changes.If the content is good domain name is identical
       keywords is a big advantage

       Same here. I found several of my sites knocked back down by EMD and
       they are high quality and much loved sites. One has even been added
       to sold software because of the accuracy of the information.
       Also, one of my pages was penalised out of existance in April 2012
       by Penguin but now it is back in
       first place with the blue links under it as very much loved by
       Google. How can
       it be bad one month and excellent a few months later with no
       changes?? I have
       also found Google disobeying robots.txt and indexing pages that
       they shouldn't
       be. And on their forum they say it is because they cannot read the
       "noindex" because it is blocked by robots.txt but they read it
       anyway
       so how can that be? And to state another obvious point, if
       robots.txt blocks a
       page, then isn't it blatently obvious that you do not want it
       indexed??? So I
       physically blocked the pages with mod_rewrite and the next thing I
       found was
       Google trying to gain access through FTP on my server!!! What on
       earth are they
       up to? I also had Zonealarm saying that some Google software wanted
       acess to
       the net and yet I have no Google software installed and never have.
       Are they
       putting spyware out there now as well? Something is very wrong here
       and there
       can be no doubt that Matts changes are seriously flawed. I am now
       using Bing
       and helping them make changes for the better and I am finding
       excellent
       results. [108]http://www.bing.com is now the best
       choice I have found. Since the results are intelligent and stable
       in Bing, what
       can we do to make it more popular and then we no longer have to do
       the Google
       dance?
     * http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002195460442 Jose Lopez
       I welcome the change because this will weed out low quality
       websites and weed out other SEO personals selling outdated SEO
       services to the public.
