   What's This?

   By Kurt Wagner2013-09-09 21:09:38 UTC

   [48]Twitter CEO Dick Costolo took the stage at [49]TechCrunch's Disrupt
   event Monday afternoon, but he didn't talk about his own company. In
   fact, Costolo didn't even mention Twitter during his brief stint on
   stage. Instead, the former entrepreneur and one-time [50]Google
   employee shared leadership advice with the audience, which is
   appropriate considering he may soon lead his own company through an
   IPO.

   Costolo presented the audience with a short but passionate speech on
   how to lead, particularly in a startup environment where leadership
   roles may not be well defined.

   "If you don't deal with [leadership roles], dysfunction becomes
   embedded in your company," he said. "That dysfunction becomes learned
   and part of the culture of the company and it's almost impossible to
   eradicate it."

   Here are some of Costolo's tips for successful leadership as he guides
   Twitter toward a possible entrance onto Wall Street.
    1. Don't try to make friends. "As a leader, you need to care deeply,
       deeply about your people while not worrying or really even caring
       about what they think about you," Costolo said. "Managing by trying
       to be liked is the path to ruin."
       Costolo admits this is easier said than done, but added it's
       important to avoid simply telling your employees what they want to
       hear. Don't apologize for making a tough decision, he said, be
       confident and clear when dictating what must be done.
    2. There are many different ways to be a successful leader. Often,
       particularly in Silicon Valley, successful CEOs are overanalyzed
       and placed under a microscope. "We take notes and we feverishly try
       to imitate what they've done to be successful," Costolo said. "The
       reality is, these people are the same people they were 10 years
       ago, and are going to be 10 years from now when it may not work at
       all for them. The very same person they are today that's lionized
       may be frowned upon 10 years from now." Leadership techniques
       change, so it's vital to understand there are many paths to
       success.
    3. Be transparent. "The way you build trust with your people is by
       being forthright and clear with them from day one," he said. "You
       may think people are fooled when you tell them what they want to
       hear. They are not fooled." As a leader, people are always looking
       at you, Costolo continued. Don't lose their trust by failing to
       provide transparency in your decisions and critiques.
       What's the best piece of leadership advice you've ever received?

       9 Twitter Accounts Every Startup Investor Should Follow
         1. 5f9c7398

1. [52]@fredwilson
            Fred also blogs daily at [53]avc.com, and engages with his
            followers in the comment section. (Bonus: the comments are
            sometimes as good as the blog post itself.)
            Wilson has an MBA Monday series, which educates both investors
            and entrepreneurs on all aspects of a startup, from [54]return
            on investment to [55]cap tables. He posts links on Twitter
            along with additional educational content.
         2. 6a1fe195

2. [56]@sacca
            Angel investor turned VC Chris Sacca doesn't have a blog, but
            he does retweet relevant investor information (and
            occasionally some funny content, as well). He was an early
            adopter and investor in Twitter a few years ago, and more
            recently, invested in Turntable.fm. He tweeted often about his
            use of Turntable. Without Chris' advice, it would have taken
            me weeks to learns about the company - a lifetime in the world
            of startups.
            As new companies and technologies emerge, investors like Chris
            have an opportunity to see great companies before the masses.
            They can point you to what is currently hot in the market. It
            is beneficial to have this insight when you are looking to
            invest.

3. [57]@danprimack
            Dan is a reporter who writes about private equity and venture
            capital for [58]Fortune. Among his daily Twitter posts, you'll
            find [59]pre-marketing links related to private equity. He
            organizes all the most interesting content for the day into
            one place, and comments on stories evolving throughout the
            day.
         4. 6a4f08ba

4. [60]@msuster
            Mark Suster is an entrepreneur who made the leap to venture
            capital, but blogs for [61]Both Sides of the Table. His posts
            are very well-thought out, well-written and go into a lot of
            detail about topics helpful to new investors. He also engages
            with his community in the comment sections, which provides a
            lot of additional insight. Since he doesn't blog daily, I rely
            on his Twitter feed to alert me to his posts and any
            additional links he shares.
         5. 8e851d4b

5. [62]@bfeld
            Brad Feld is a venture capitalist at Foundry Group. Follow
            Brad on Twitter for insights into current topics in the
            venture capital world. He has been blogging for a long time,
            and has a lot of great content on his [63]website. Also, see
            his great set of posts on [64]term sheets; they were the basis
            of his recent book [65]Venture Deals, a must-read for every
            investor and entrepreneur.
         6. A4b8807c

6. [66]@cdixon
            Chris is an angel investor who runs Founder Collective, and
            also a co-founder of Hunch. Although he doesn't [67]blog as
            frequently as a lot of the other investors, his content is
            reliably valuable. He organizes posts into [68]sections, like
            Raising money, Startup Sales/Marketing, Operations and other
            great topics. You can spend hours learning about startups and
            investing on this blog.
         7. 8e77f246

7. [69]@robgo
            When I first started following Rob, he was with Spark Capital,
            but has since moved to NextView ventures. He occasionally
            writes about investing and startups on his [70]blog, and
            tweets about topics that any investor will find useful. I also
            like to follow Rob because he tweets about Boston and NY
            startups, a perspective I might not otherwise be focused on.
         8. B94179c0

8. [71]@bryce
            Chris Sacca recommended Bryce Roberts, saying that "he writes
            thoughtfully." I have to agree with Chris. I frequently click
            on Bryce's recommended links and read his [72]blog to gain
            insight into the industry.
         9. A69829c2

9. [73]@bussgang
            Jeff Bussgang is another entrepreneur turned VC and a partner
            at Flybridge Capital. His [74]blog is similar in concept to
            Mark Suster's: a VC's perspective with former entrepreneurial
            experience.
            He only blogs 3-4 times per month, so I rely on Twitter to
            update me with his new content. Jeff is a frequent Twitter
            user, and posts a lot of additional thoughts on investing. He
            also has a useful book called [75]Mastering the VC Game that
            every investor should pick up.
