   iWatch, no thanks, I want a Smartwatch that goes Vroom!
   While most folks working on Smartwatches want to focus on either
   exorcise (Nike) or every gadget known to man (Samsung) I think there is
   a real opportunity to create one that links with your new car.
   Particularly if you look at electrics like the Tesla being able to
   monitor the car, find it when parked, or manage it is increasingly
   handy. In addition a branding connection between the car and watch
   would allow you to showcase you have one even if you aren't driving it
   (oh, I see your watch, do you drive a Tesla too?). As we get smarter
   cars maybe our smarter watches should form a relationship with them. At
   least that's what I'm arguing in my Digital Trends column this week:
