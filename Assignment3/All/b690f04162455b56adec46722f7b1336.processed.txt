Hands On With the iPhone 5C

    1. Apple-event-54

Introducing the iPhone 5C
       For the first time ever, Apple launched a second device alongside
       its next-generation iPhone (the 5S). Dubbed the iPhone 5C, the
       low-cost smartphone will cost $99 in the U.S. for a 16 GB model and
       $199 for 32 GB.
    2. Apple-event-81

Five Colors
       The iPhone 5C comes in five flavors: blue, green, yellow, pink and
       white.
    3. Apple-event-127

Measurements
       The iPhone 5C has the same measurements as the iPhone 5 and 5S, but
       it's constructed from soft silicon rubber, rather than anodized
       aluminum.
    4. Apple-event-125

iOS 7
       The iPhone 5C will ship with iOS 7, Apple's completely
       re-engineered mobile operating system. The device also includes an
       A6 chip and a slightly larger battery than the iPhone 5.
    5. Apple-event-77

iSight Camera
       The iPhone 5C's iSight camera touts a 3x video zoom and a new
       FaceTime HD camera. The rear camera is 8 megapixels, and comes with
       back-side illumination and a hybrid IR filter. It also supports
       more LTE bands than any other smartphone in the world.
    6. Apple-event-178

Cases
       For $29, iPhone 5C users can dress up their devices with brightly
       colored cases. The cases come with holes to add color-contrasting
       to the device. Some say it looks like the game Connect Four or
       other [48]quirky items.
    7. Apple-event-29

Availability
       Pre-orders start on Sept. 13, and the iPhone 5C will go on sale on
       Sept. 20 in the United States, China, Australia, Canada, France,
       Germany, Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom. By December, the
       iPhone 5C will be available in over 100 countries and on 270
       carriers.

   Colors are in. Nokia's been selling Day-Glo smartphones for ages,
   Motorola lets you design your own colorful case cover and now,
   [49]Apple is selling the candy-colored iPhone 5C.

   While the 5C's specs are largely familiar to anyone who owns an iPhone
   5 (retina display, LTE, iSight camera, A6 chip), everything else about
   the new phone is surprising -- at least for Apple. It's the company's
   first budget smartphone (costing $99 with a two-year contract), its
   body is polycarbonate (or as Jony Ive put it, "unapologetically
   plastic") and it shared the stage in Cupertino on Tuesday with Apple's
   second new handset: the [50]iPhone 5s. Before this week, no iPhone has
   ever had to share the spotlight.

   But make no mistake: The innovation is almost entirely on the iPhone
   5S' side. Let's call the iPhone 5C an innovation in product marketing.
   If you think Apple's flagship phone is too expensive, then perhaps
   you'd like a $99 phone that has all the power of the now-retired iPhone
   5. Worried that the iPhone 5S' glass and metal body is too fragile for
   your kids to handle? Check out the polycarbonate body on the iPhone 5C.
   With its rounder edges, the budget phone is definitely ready to handle
   its share of drops and rough living.

In My Hands

   Apple's new iOS 7 looks right at home on the iPhone 5C (possibly even
   more so than the iPhone 5s), as its colorful exterior appears to almost
   exactly match the operating system's primary-color palette.

   Slightly larger than the iPhone 5s (and 5), the iPhone 5C felt cool,
   comfortable and sturdy in my hand. The one-piece plastic body is shiny
   and smooth to the touch. On the front is the familiar home button (with
   its trademark box) and an edge-to-edge glass face, which houses the
   4-inch retina display. Inside the phone is a steel frame, which doubles
   as an antenna, and adds to the rigid feel.

   While the 5C shares most of the iPhone 5's specs, Apple did upgrade the
   FaceTime camera. I had a chance to run my iPhone 5's front
   facing-camera alongside the one on the iPhone 5C; the difference was
   startling, and is sure to change the video-calling experience.

Bigger Markets to Fry

   Although the iPhone 5C bears little resemblance to recent iPhones, and
   echoes the iPhone 3G/3GS (which had plastic backs), it's still probably
   best described as a reskinned iPhone 5.

   In the demo room at Apple's Tuesday event, tech journalists crowded
   around the available iPhone 5Ss, as a collection of iPhone 5Cs and
   their silicon rubber cases were left largely untouched. Undeterred, I
   kept playing with the budget phone, looking for differences that are
   more than just skin-deep. I asked Apple reps what sets the iPhone 5C
   apart. In response, they pointed to the FaceTime camera, but beyond
   that, they were stumped.

   Don't get me wrong -- I think the new bodies and colors will appeal to
   many people who think Apple's flagship phone is too austere. What's
   more, the new price puts iPhone 5 technology in reach for a whole
   budget-conscious set of users.

   Many of them live in China.

   Correction: This article originally misidentified the material of the
   original iPhone's back as plastic. As commenters have pointed out, the
   iPhone didn't get a plastic back until the iPhone 3G.
