Today, Congress holds hearings on the first American Internet censorship
system.

This bill can pass. If it does the Internet and free speech will never be the
same.

Join all of us to stop this bill.

Website Blocking

   The government can order service providers to block websites for
   infringing links posted by any users.

Risk of Jail for Ordinary Users

   It becomes a felony with a potential 5 year sentence to stream a
   copyrighted work that would cost more than $2,500 to license, even if
   you are a totally noncommercial user, e.g. singing a pop song on
   Facebook.

Chaos for the Internet

   Thousands of sites that are legal under the DMCA would face new legal
   threats. People trying to keep the internet more secure wouldn't be
   able to rely on the integrity of the DNS system.

   How you can help

   We got congress to drop censorship once, but they'll almost surely
   bring it back when the public's attention is on something else. Sign up
   to flood Congress with emails and phonecalls if SOPA returns:

REACTIONS TO THIS BILL, [45]"SOPA" H.R.3261
       "These bills were written by the content industry without any input
       from the technology industry. And they are trying to fast track
       them through congress and into law without any negotiation with the
       technology industry."
       - [46]Fred Wilson (Union Square Ventures)
       "SOPA, regrettably, represents a big step backward in Washington's
       efforts to support the digital revolution, one of the only sectors
       of the economy that continues to grow."
       - [47]Larry Downes (TechFreedom)
       [gigi-sohn.png]
       "[SOPA would] overturn the long-accepted principles and practices
       [of the DMCA] in favor of a one-sided enforcement mechanism that is
       far more broad than existing law while not attempting to protect
       the rights of anyone accused of copyright infringement."
       - [48]Gigi B. Sohn (President of Public Knowledge)
       "It contains provisions that will chill innovation. It contains
       provisions that will tinker with the fundamental fabric of the
       internet. It gives private corporations the power to censor. And
       best of all, it bypasses due legal process to do much of it."
       - [49]James Allworth (Harvard Business School)
       "The main "enforcement" mechanism in these bills is to put
       liability on third party service providers coming from the tech
       industry, undermining the safe harbors of the DMCA and the legal
       framework that has allowed tons of important internet platforms to
       evolve."
       - [50]Mike Masnick (TechDirt)
       "This is a move that threatens, rather than protects, property
       rights, and also threatens America's Internet and tech leadership."
       - [51]Neil Stevens (RedState.com)
