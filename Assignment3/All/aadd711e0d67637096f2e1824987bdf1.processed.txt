[4]Does time fix all?

   As an undergraduate, finding useful references was painful. What the
   librarians had come up with were terrible time-consuming systems. It
   took an outsider (Berners-Lee) to invent the Web. Even so, the
   librarians were slow to adopt the Web and you could often see them warn
   students against using the Web as part of their research. Some of us
   ignored them and posted our papers online, or searched for papers
   online. Many, many years later, we are still a crazy minority but a new
   generation of librarians has finally adopted the Web.

   What do you conclude from this story?

   Whenever you point to a difficult systemic problem (e.g., it is time
   consuming to find references), someone will reply that "time fixes
   everything". A more sophisticated way to express this belief is to say
   that systems are self-correcting.

   Yet few systems are self-correcting. We simply bear the cost of the
   mistakes and inefficiencies. If some academic discipline fails to make
   us better off, we barely notice and we keep paying for it. What we see
   as corrections are often disruptions brought by people who worked from
   outside the supposedly self-correcting system.

   Far from self-correcting, the system resists changes. For example,
   lectures are a terrible way to teach, yet they have been around for
   centuries and we are likely to lecture for at least decades, if not
   centuries. They are provably not cost-effective from a learning
   perspective. But it will take strong outside forces to get any change.

   Maybe librarians would have eventually invented the Web. I doubt it,
   but given enough time everything is possible. Yet "in the long run we
   are all dead." (Keynes) The argument that if enough time passes, the
   problem will be solved mostly makes sense if you plan to live forever.
   Neither you nor our civilization will be around forever.

   We need better science and technological innovation today. It is not ok
   to say that if we wait another generation, we will find out how to
   control the climate and generate free energy. Our survival as a
   civilization depends on our ability to remain innovative today.

   The stock market has been flat for the last ten years. It is not at all
   automatic that new prosperity will emerge through new innovations and
   inventions. It may very well not happen in my lifetime. I'm a
   techno-optimist, so I believe we will out-innovate our problems, but I
   don't believe that the system will do it. Crazy people will have to act
   outside of the norm. We won't have Internet-enabled brain implants if
   we just wait long enough: some Ph.D. student needs to sign waivers and
   make his mother cry so we have any chance to know how it feels to have
   the Internet in your brain.

   Free-market advocates believe that free markets are self-correcting.
   That is a more believable notion except for the fact that there is no
   such thing as a free market in the real world.

   By the way: things often become worse over time. My body is living
   proof: I'm weaker than when I was in my 20s.

   Conclusion: People too often believe that the systems they are in are
   self-correcting. Yet corrections, when they happen, are often actually
   disruptions brought forth by outsiders. Trust that systems, when left
   alone, will do the right thing, is overly optimistic.

   We should celebrate outsiders and protect them from the wrath of the
   insiders.

    1. "The argument that if enough time passes, the problem will be
       solved mostly make sense if you plan to live forever."
       Uh! No! When you're dead you don't have any problem either, or may
       be you believe in after-life, and a one which sucks?

    2. I've been thinking about this as well[1]. The durability of a group
       often boils down to 4 words: Be Welcoming To Outsiders.
       A common response to software being broken is to say, "We rewrite
       everything in a few years anyway." It seeks to turn a liability
       (code) into an asset (dynamism), which si good for morale in a
       large organization. However, it's a terrible argument for two
       reasons:
       a) The code you have today affects what you write tomorrow, even if
       you replace all of it.
       b) You never replace all of it. A very good org might keep 5% of
       it. But which 5%?

    3. It seems to be a corollary to the The Shirky Principle
       ([11]http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2010/04/the_shirky_prin
       .php):
       "Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are
       the solution." -- Clay Shirky

    4. From above: "... What the librarians had come up with were terrible
       time-consuming systems. It took an outsider (Berners-Lee) to invent
       the Web...."
       Really?
       You mean the librarians who had been working on digital retrieval
       since the late 1940's and subject retrieval longer than that? Those
       librarians?
       With the web, every user repeats the search effort of others. Why
       isn't repeating the effort of others a "terrible time-consuming
       system?"
       BTW, Berners-Lee invented allowing 404s for hyperlinks. Significant
       because it lowered the overhead of hyperlinking enough to be
       practical. It was other CS types with high overhead hyperlinking.
       Not librarians.
       Berners-Lee fixed hyperlinking maintenance, failed and continues to
       fail on IR. Or have you not noticed?

    5. When I was at University, all of our research was done the
       "old-fashioned way"- and, quite frankly it was much easier than it
       is today. Back when I first gained access to the DARPAnet, I was
       really excited about a new way to do research- until I found out
       that, when researching a new topic about which one had limited
       knowledge of the subject jargon, would result in thousands of
       citations, many of which were repeats of information published
       elsewhere, or rehashes of what others had published, or papers that
       had been rescinded or superseded by newer work...but with time, I
       developed a private filtering method (based on the inverse of the
       frequency of publication) that could get me to the core information
       quickly.
       Then the Internet came along. Great access to a much broader
       universe of information...finally evolving into a totally useless
       system for doing basic research because the marketers have gamed
       the system so thoroughly that the really good information is
       generally buried ten pages into the search (if it is picked up at
       all). Valuable information is harder to sort from the chaff than
       ever before...
       The conclusion I draw from my own experiences is that, no matter
       how good the system is, someone is going to come along and
       complicate it to the point where it is no longer functional. NO
       system is going to be self-correcting- it is going to go down
       ultimately to over-complication (or, if you want to think in terms
       of social systems, societies come to inglorious ends because they
       become overly complex- unable, in the end, to respond in a timely
       fashion to some crisis- unless they welcome outsiders with a
       different perspective).
       So, " People too often believe that the systems they are in are
       self-correcting. Yet corrections, when they happen, are often
       actually disruptions brought forth by outsiders. Trust that
       systems, when left alone, will do the right thing, is overly
       optimist.
       We should celebrate outsiders and protect them from the wrath of
       the insiders."
       I agree 100%, as long as you don't just pile the contributions of
       the outsiders on top of the old, non-functional system...

    6. Charlie, it's hard to understate how much I agree.
