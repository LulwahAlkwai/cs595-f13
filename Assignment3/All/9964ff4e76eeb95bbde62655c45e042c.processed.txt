[26]The best magazine on the Internet?
       hamishmckenzie By [27]Hamish McKenzie
       On September 16, 2013
       Aeon Magazine
       If "[28]slow media" needs a poster child, it can find one in
       [29]Aeon Magazine, an online publication about culture and ideas
       that marks its first birthday tomorrow. In the space of a year, the
       magazine, started by a London-based Australian couple who have no
       background in media, has established itself as a first-rate example
       of a modern-day magazine, free from the constraints of legacy press
       and proudly aloof from the pageview-chasing linkbaitery of the Web
       2.0 era. It publishes top writers, carries no ads, and encourages
       readers to save its stories for reading later via the likes of
       Instapaper, Kindle, or Pocket. Publishing just one essay a day,
       five days a week, it serves as a venue for considered cultural
       critiques, thoughtful essays on existentialism, and deep dives on
       science and nature.
       Aeon is, right now, my favorite magazine. It is also, I think, the
       best example of a magazine built for the age of mobile. It focuses
       on reading over revenue. It favors contemplation over consumption.
       In letting its articles travel anywhere its readers go, it pays no
       heed to the "bundle."
       "We saw Aeon as something of a corrective to the sense that a lot
       of people have of drowning in information," says Paul Hains,
       co-founder and managing director of the company. "We really try to
       look at the deeper issues, the ideas, and the values that are
       animating the news, and we focus on those things in particular."
       Standout stories published by Aeon in its first year include Ross
       Andersen's [30]8,000-word report on the likelihood of imminent
       human extinction, neuroscientist Michael Graziano's [31]essay about
       a new theory of consciousness, Mary HK Choi's [32]paean to her
       mother, and Jessica Gamble's [33]rumination on contemporary
       sleeping habits. The articles, grouped under categories entitled
       "World Views," "Nature & Cosmos," "Being Human," "Living Together,"
       and "Altered States," always run long and are sharply edited (the
       editorial team includes editors with experience at The Daily
       Telegraph, The New Statesman, and the Los Angeles Review of Books).
       While the essays often trade in academic subjects, they are
       communicated in plain terms accessible to a wide readership.
       "We don't want our pieces to feel abstruse or specialist," says
       Aeon's editor Brigid Hains, who has an academic background, holding
       a PhD in history and a graduate degree in anthropology. Instead,
       the publication strives for what the Hainses call "idea
       egalitarianism."
       The Hainses are a married couple who wanted to start an online
       forum for what is essentially the antidote to the Twitterized
       hyper-torrent of information splidgets that now assault us on a
       daily basis. "Brigid and I had a view that there were ideas and
       ways of thinking that were under-represented in the cultural
       conversation," says Paul. "Aeon as a magazine is a vehicle to
       create a focus on these ideas and foster discussion around them."
       Paul, who used to work in finance but has an abiding interest in
       psychology and comparative religion, funds Aeon. He has put up
       enough capital (he declines to say how much) to last for three
       years, so the company can focus on the quality of its product
       without having to worry about money. So if you're looking to Aeon
       for magic solutions to journalism's business model problem, you
       won't find it here.
       "The longer we can defer making any commitments to a specific
       business model, the better we'll be," says Paul, "because the
       landscape is changing all the time."
       That means Aeon's stories are free, even while the publication pays
       its writers at rates comparable to those paid by broadsheet
       newspapers. (The founders won't say exactly what that rate is, but
       Brigid says 60 cents a word is "not a bad guess.") It also means
       there are no ads, and the editors don't mind if you leave the Aeon
       website to read a story somewhere else. A link to "Read later or
       Kindle" is placed on the same line as the by-line and the
       word-count, a subtle indicator that the story is king, even if it
       means readers ultimately spend less time on the site.
       The content-first approach to modern publishing may turn out to be
       a winner, even as the business challenges for journalism remain
       significant and unresolved. Thanks to the distributive networks
       such as Twitter, Facebook, and email, and the concurrent rise of
       mobile devices as the mediums to which those networks pump content,
       the idea of a homepage or a magazine bundle just simply doesn't
       matter as much as it did in the print age or the first two decades
       of the Web.
       Stories must now travel on their own, to be judged on their
       individual strengths independent of the context within which they
       were originally placed. Soon, if it's not true already, magazine
       brands will matter more as marks of quality or tone than they do as
       gatherers and arrangers of content in a unified experience. By
       predicating its publishing model on stories that can be pried from
       the bundle and whose ideas stand on their own, Aeon confirms itself
       as a bankable brand synonymous with quality and depth. It publishes
       stories based not on how many clicks their headlines might
       generate, but on engaging people's attention for a meaningful
       period of time. That is the standard to which magazines of the
       mobile era must aspire.
       Of course, unlike other startup publications, Aeon can afford such
       luxuries, because it doesn't yet have to worry about making money.
       In three years' time, it may be forced to take a less
       reader-friendly approach in a search for revenue. In terms of
       business, all Aeon has proven in its first 12 months is that it can
       fund its own boutique publishing operation. The real tests come as
       it scales, and when the numbers in the bank account approach zero.
       For now, traffic on the site seems to be doing okay. Some stories
       do much better than others, with the most-circulated pieces
       attracting as many as 2,000 tweets or Facebook likes. But the
       founders decline to share traffic numbers.
       Next, Aeon will build on its brand by launching a companion site
       dedicated to films (as distinct from "videos," Paul stresses). Aeon
       Film will reflect the ethos of the magazine, say the Hainses, with
       an emphasis on short documentaries. The films showcased will be a
       mix of material curated from around the Web and exclusives that the
       company pays to license.
       The film vertical, says Paul, will seed the transition from the
       text-based digital publication to a multimedia product. At that
       point, Aeon will be one step more unconventional than it already
       is. It is the magazine that isn't, the anti-aggregator, the
       publication that insists on going slow when every other force of
       the Internet demands that we speed up.
       But considering how well traditional models are working in today's
       media landscape, unconventional is probably a good thing.
