   It's never been easier, more accessible, or more essential to learn
   coding skills.

   Why Programming Is The Core Skill Of The 21st Century

   In the 20th Century, meaningful education was all about learning your
   ABCs. Today, it's centered on Alphas, Betas and C++.

   Programming skills are becoming ever more important, quickly turning
   into the core competency for all kinds of 21st Century workers. That
   inescapable fact is leading individuals to seek out new ways of
   learning to code, startups and non-profits to find ways to help them
   and businesses to search for innovative approaches to finding the
   coders they so desperately need.

   When daily deal site [5]Living Social couldn't find the coding help it
   needed, for example, the company took matters into its own hands and
   successfully created its own qualified programmers. Through an
   experiment called [6]Hungry Academy,  Living Social paid 24 people to
   learn computer programming within five months. All two dozen passed the
   class and became full-time developers at Living Social following their
   graduation.

   "We believe that intelligence and passion are far harder to hire for
   and much more important than a specific technical skill," Chad Fowler,
   LivingSocial's senior vice president of technology, [7]told the
   Washington Post last year. "We have enough of the kind of DIY sort of
   mentality here and, maybe it's a little bit of hubris, we can teach
   faster than the industry."

   Likely due to Living Social's [8]larger troubles, the company won't be
   repeating the experiment. However the concept it nurtured - teaching
   untechnical people technical skills - is gaining in popularity in a
   wide variety of ways. Learn-to-code programs bent on teaching anyone,
   even children, programming skills are on the upswing, at non-profits,
   at startups and at companies that need to hire programmers.

Plenty Of Ways To Learn Programming

   Mark Lassoff, founder of [11]Learntoprogram.tv, believes it's not the
   place you learn to code that counts. It's the portfolio you can show
   potential employers.

   "People think you have to go back to school to learn programming and
   other computer skills, but you don't," he said in a statement. "There's
   also the myth that you have to be some kind of math or science genius
   to learn it. Not true. You just need to learn the process, and then
   practice it. You can build a portfolio by doing volunteer work for a
   church or charity."

   Ordinarily, newly minted developers would be less desirable than
   experienced ones for employers. But the current developer drought
   means there are far more jobs that require programming skills than
   people who have those skills.  So companies are more accepting of
   programming newbies.

Lots Of Coding Jobs Going Begging

   The number of coding jobs is only expected to increase over time.
   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 913,000
   computer programmer jobs in 2010. That number is expected to
   jump [13]30% from 2010 to 2020. Meanwhile, the average growth of all
   other U.S. jobs is predicted to be just [14]14%.

   "There aren't enough people to fill these jobs because technology and
   the job market are moving much faster than education in high schools
   and colleges," Lassoff said.

How Coding Can Boost Everyone's Career

   Developer and mentor [15]Joe O'Brien believes that computer skills are
   essential even if you've already got a non-technical job.

   "We all interact with computers in such a way that they're no longer
   this extra thing you do on the side," O'Brien told ReadWrite.
   "Computing is a vital part of what everybody does nowadays.

   "Not that we want everyone to go out and create Web programs and write
   the next Twitter, but I think having a base understanding of what
   happens behind the curtain can be huge," he added.

   O'Brien never graduated from college, but he did recently sell
   [16]Edgecase, the software development company he founded and operated
   himself. He thinks that his programming skills made him a better CEO
   than he would have been without them. Today, he mentors aspiring
   programmers in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio.

   "Even if a CEO never codes for her company, just understanding what is
   happening is going to be huge for her from a risk standpoint, from an
   understanding standpoint," he said. "CEOs need to have a lot of
   knowledge of a lot of different things and programming is a large part
   of that."

Teaching Programming Is Big Business

   CEOs who think like O'Brien might be the reason that learn-to-code
   startups have been able to fundraise millions in venture capital.
   Investors seem to realize that companies like [17]Treehouse and
   [18]Codecademy don't just train the next generation of developers, but
   that the skill they teach are essential for managers, too.

   Whether to boost your career or just to keep pace with the rest of the
   world, learning to code has never been more important or more
   accessible. If you haven't started yet, what's stopping you?
