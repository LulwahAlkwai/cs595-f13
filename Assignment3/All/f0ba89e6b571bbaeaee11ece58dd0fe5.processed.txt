The six stages of assistant professorship

   By most methods of accounting, I've had a pretty successful academic
   career. I took a straight and narrow path to and through graduate
   school, starting directly after undergrad and finishing my D.Sc. when I
   was 27. I started my first (and only!) faculty job immediately
   thereafter at Georgia Tech in the College of Computing. I was tenured
   and promoted to associate professor on schedule and to full professor
   about four years after that. I am a Fellow of the IEEE though not yet
   an ACM Fellow.
   I say all this as preface to sharing the broad outlines of my
   pre-tenure experience, which I think have some commonality even for
   those who are quite successful. Here is the short version:
   Year 1: I don't belong in this job
   Year 2: I don't want this job
   Year 3: Maybe I can do this job
   Year 4: I can do this job
   Year 5: If they don't tenure me its their problem
   Year 6: There are other important things in life
   And here is the longer version:
   Year 1. Like many new faculty members, I was completely overwhelmed by
   the requirements of the job. The first class I taught was senior-level
   computer architecture, an area that shares some conceptual content with
   my area of computer networking, but isn't all that close. I was briefly
   threatened with video taping for distribution to students somewhere
   else (not sure where), but fortunately that did not materialize. I
   alternated between nightmares that I made the exams too easy and
   nightmares that I made the exams too hard. (Mostly I made them too hard
   and sometimes ambiguous.) I frequently felt that "they" would figure
   out they should not have hired me. This is classic imposter syndrome,
   well known to befell underrepresented minorities. It led me not to want
   a mentor.  (You want to identify someone for me to tell all about my
   struggles? No way.) One of the very hardest things about Year 1 is that
   everything you are asked to do, you are doing for the first time, and
   it seems so important to do it all well since they are watching.
   Actually nobody is watching very carefully, but it takes awhile to
   figure that out.
   Year 2. Things were marginally easier, in no small part because almost
   everything was being done for the second time not the first.  I started
   some tentative local collaborations and had a few students starting to
   work on projects. I did all the other usual professor things -- wrote
   proposals, had a part in a big cross-campus proposal, taught, served on
   internal committees. I found that peers could serve a mentoring role,
   especially when we co-advised students. I worked many hours and thought
   about work nearly all the time when I wasn't actually doing it. During
   this year my primary thought was that if this was the job, I wasn't
   sure I wanted it. Working all the time under lots of stress? Hmm.
   Years 3 and 4. By Year 3 more projects and students had traction. I
   heard a talk on an out-of-the-box idea in computer networking called
   active networking, and I got pretty excited about it. A close
   collaborator and a fantastic student started working on it. We got
   DARPA funding which put us into a community of many senior researchers
   who were great fun to interact with. The job was still a lot of work,
   but it was more energizing and fun.
   Year 5: By this year I realized that I was doing the job as well as I
   possibly could (and putting in as much time as I possibly could) and if
   that wasn't enough to get tenure, it was the university's loss. I
   wasn't as cocky as this sounds, instead it was more that I concluded
   there was something wrong with a system if you can work this hard and
   lose your job. Of course that can and does happen in the tenure and
   other systems.
   Year 6: I started as an assistant professor early, and I put off
   considering having kids until well into the pre-tenure time period. I
   just could not imagine adding a baby to the crazy mix. I became
   pregnant with my first child during the year before I put in my tenure
   materials. She was due in late August, and I co-taught that summer with
   my graduate student to "earn" the right to be off from teaching in the
   fall. (Family friendly policies were mostly non-existent at that time.)
    I turned in the final version of my tenure materials on a Friday, and
   I went into labor on Saturday morning. Coincidence? I doubt it. I
   graded final exams and turned in grades with a week old baby.
   Being mostly home that fall while my tenure case was under
   consideration in the department turned out to have advantages. I was
   overwhelmed and overcommitted to something else for a change. I
   returned full time in the spring and received word of tenure and
   promotion not long after that. I distinctly remember how nice it was to
   focus on work at work and home at home. As anyone with small children
   knows, that isn't a choice, exactly, but it was good and full.

       I remember that fall well. And the first few weeks of you returning
       to work! Seems like a lifetime ago!
