[69]Don't "Like" Companies on Facebook Or You'll Embarrass Yourself

   [original.png]

   The thing you Like on Facebook matter more than ever because of [70]its
   new super search--they're easier to uncover. They might come back to
   haunt you. We're all going to see them more. Here's how to protect
   yourself.

   [71]Forbes reports, with a push of the privacy panic button, that
   Facebook is "recycling your likes" to promote advertisements in the
   news feeds of your friends. By recycling, Forbes' Anthony Wing Kosner
   means Facebook is announcing that you like, say, a restaurant or
   company, months (or even years!) after you clicked anything. This might
   be bothersome, or even misleading, in that it doesn't reflect your
   preferences right at this moment.

   Don't "Like" Companies on Facebook Or You'll Embarrass Yourself

   But it's hardly an infraction--just a restatement of something you did
   and might have forgotten about. And given that Facebook is a company,
   and companies need to make money, this is hardly radical.

   What could be troublesome is the inclusion of "suggested
   posts"--basically, an advertisement for Nike paired with the fact that
   you like Nike. People who don't read well or lack full human attention
   spans (that is to say, millions of Facebook users) might think you're
   endorsing this stuff. They might think you actually care about the new
   Mountain Dew flavor, and then think less of you for being a corporate
   shill.

   Lucky for you, this isn't so hard to combat: don't like corporate
   propaganda on Facebook. Don't like Coca-Cola, don't like Samsung, don't
   like Nokia, don't like Budweiser. Unless you absolutely need to stay
   abreast of the latest social media promotion (you don't), keep your
   clicks away from this stuff. If you don't want to be associated with
   ads, don't sign up to advertise.

   Don't "Like" Companies on Facebook Or You'll Embarrass Yourself S

   Sometimes it's tricky. Sometimes you'll see something like this, which
   looks totally implausible.

   Don't "Like" Companies on Facebook Or You'll Embarrass Yourself S

   Until you actually think about it.

   And if having to think about all this makes you uncomfortable, steel
   thyself--as Facebook tries to turn every click into a dollar, there's
   only more where this came from.
