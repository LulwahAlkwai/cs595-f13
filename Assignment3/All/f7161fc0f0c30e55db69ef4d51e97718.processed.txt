   Due to the strike in 1981, the season was split into two halves and
   playoff seedings were determined using the winners from each half. The
   first half began on April 9 and ended June 11, while the second half
   started on August 10 and ended October 4. Overall standings are
   presented here for reference but were not used to determine playoff
   berths.
