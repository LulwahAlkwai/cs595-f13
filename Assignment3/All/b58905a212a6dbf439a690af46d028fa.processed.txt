Mindfulness Helps You Become a Better Leader

   Ever since the financial crisis of 2008, I have sensed from many
   leaders that they want to do a better job of leading in accordance with
   their personal values. The crisis exposed the fallacies of measuring
   success in monetary terms and left many leaders with a deep feeling of
   unease that they were being pulled away from what I call their True
   North.

   As markets rose and bonus pools grew, it was all too easy to celebrate
   the rising tide of wealth without examining the process that created
   it. Too many leaders placed self-interest ahead of their organizations'
   interests, and ended up disappointing the customers, employees, and
   shareholders who had trusted them. I often advise emerging leaders,
   "You know you're in trouble when you start to judge your self-worth by
   your net worth." Nevertheless, many leaders get caught up in this game
   without realizing it.

   This happened to me in 1988, when I was an executive vice president at
   Honeywell, en route to the top. By external standards I was highly
   successful, but inside I was deeply unhappy. I had begun to focus too
   much on impressing other people and positioning myself to become CEO. I
   was caught up with external measures of success instead of looking
   inward to measure my success as a human and a leader. I was losing my
   way.

   My colleague, Harvard Professor Clayton Christensen, addressed this
   topic in his HBR article, [48]How Will You Measure Your Life? Clay
   observed that few people, if any, intend at the outset of their career
   to behave dishonestly and hurt others. Early on, even Bernie Madoff and
   Enron's Jeff Skilling planned to live honest lives. But then,
   Christensen says, they started making exceptions to the rules "just
   this once."

   At Harvard Business School, we are challenging students to think hard
   about their definition of success and what's important in their lives.
   Instead of viewing success as reaching a certain position or achieving
   a certain net worth, we encourage these future leaders to see success
   as making a positive difference in the lives of their colleagues, their
   organizations, their families, and society as a whole. The course that
   I created in 2005, Authentic Leadership Development (ALD), has become
   one of the most popular elective MBA courses, thanks to my HBS
   colleagues who are currently teaching it. It enables second-year MBAs
   to ground their careers in their beliefs, values, and principles,
   following the authentic leadership process described in my 2007 book,
   [49]True North. More recently, ALD has become a very popular course for
   executives of global companies.

   With all the near-term pressures in today's society, especially in
   business, it is very difficult to find the right equilibrium between
   achieving our long-term goals and short-term financial metrics. As you
   take on greater leadership responsibilities, the key is to stay
   grounded and authentic, face new challenges with humility, and balance
   professional success with more important but less easily quantified
   measures of personal success. That is much easier said than done.

   The practice of mindful leadership gives you tools to measure and
   manage your life as you're living it. It teaches you to pay attention
   to the present moment, recognizing your feelings and emotions and
   keeping them under control, especially when faced with highly stressful
   situations. When you are mindful, you're aware of your presence and the
   ways you impact other people. You're able to both observe and
   participate in each moment, while recognizing the implications of your
   actions for the longer term. And that prevents you from slipping into a
   life that pulls you away from your values.

   I don't use the word "practice" lightly. In order to gain awareness and
   clarity about the present moment, you must be able to quiet your mind.
   That is tremendously difficult and takes a lifetime of practice. In
   2012, I had the privilege of presenting my ideas on authentic
   leadership to his Holiness the Dalai Lama. When I asked him what it
   took to become an authentic leader, he replied, "You must have
   practices that you engage in every day."

   My most important introspective practice is meditation, something I try
   to do for twenty minutes twice a day. In 1975 I went with my wife Penny
   to a Transcendental Meditation (TM) Workshop. Although I never adopted
   the spiritual portion of TM, the physical practice became an integral
   part of my daily routine. Meditation has been a godsend for me. As an
   active leader who has held highly stressful roles since my
   mid-twenties, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure in my early
   thirties. When I started meditating, I was able to stay calmer and more
   focused in my leadership, without losing the "edge" that I believed had
   made me successful. Meditation enabled me to cast off the many trivial
   worries that once possessed me and gain clarity about what was really
   important. I gradually became more self-aware and more sensitive to the
   impact I was having on others. Just as important, my blood pressure
   returned to normal and stayed there.

   In recent years, medical studies have found evidence of meditation's
   many benefits, including [50]protecting against health problems from
   high blood pressure and arthritis to infertility, [51]reducing stress,
   improving attention and sensory processing; and [52]physically altering
   parts of the brain associated with learning and memory, emotional
   regulation, and perspective-taking -- critical cognitive skills for
   leaders attempting to maintain their equilibrium under constant
   pressure.

   While many CEOs and companies are embracing meditation, it may not be
   for everyone. The important thing is to have a set time each day to
   pull back from the intense pressures of leadership to reflect on what
   is happening. In addition to meditation, I know leaders who take time
   for daily journaling, prayer, and reflecting while walking, hiking or
   jogging. I also find it extremely helpful to share the day's events
   with Penny and seek her counsel.

   Regardless of the daily introspective practice you choose, the pursuit
   of mindful leadership will help you achieve clarity about what is
   important to you and a deeper understanding of the world around you.
   Mindfulness will help you clear away the trivia and needless worries
   about unimportant things, nurture passion for your work and compassion
   for others, and develop the ability to empower the people in your
   organization.
