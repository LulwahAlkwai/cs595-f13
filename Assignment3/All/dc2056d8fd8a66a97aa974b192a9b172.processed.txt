   How to Prepare for a Potential Syrian Attack on the US Power Grid
   It continues to amaze me that we continue to ignore the warnings that
   eventually someone we shoot at will figure out a way to fire back. It
   seems clear the Syrian Army demonstrated this pretty impressively with
   their broad attack on US companies last month and this is likely why
   the Obama administration moved to get congressional approval. Rule one
   in politics, if something is going to go well don't share the credit,
   rule two, if it is going to go to hell share the blame. Given we can't
   keep folks from doing stupid things in my CIO column this week I
   suggest ways companies should think about protecting their people and
   facilities from an extended outage and given how fragile the grid is,
   some long term suggestions on where to place those facilities in the
   first place. Both Apple and Google do seem to be following this prudent
   path with their new major structures. CIO column here this week (go
   long on candles):
