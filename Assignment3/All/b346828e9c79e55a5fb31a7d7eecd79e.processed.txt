   What's This?

   [47]Lance-ulanoff-headshot-sq
   By Lance Ulanoff2013-09-17 19:21:19 UTC

   Samsung's new [48]Galaxy Gear smart watch got a lot of press and
   attention a few weeks ago, and you probably think you know all there is
   to know about the technology giant's first wearable gadget and its
   plans for on-your-wrist technology. We bet you don't.

   Here are some interesting facts and insights, shared with us by Samsung
   execs, about the smart watch and what Samsung is considering for its
   future in the potential $16 billion wearable technology market.

1. Get Ready for the Apps

   [49]Samsung expects that there will be 70 third-party apps ready for
   the Galaxy Gear when it launches in the U.S. in October. When Mashable
   quizzed Samsung execs on whether apps are ported or built, they
   acknowledged that they're mostly built. Samsung Mobile's Chief Product
   Officer Kevin Packingham, however, clarified: Since the apps are all
   Android-based, "it's typically slimming it down, not a complete
   rewrite."

   As for where the rest of the social network apps are (at the unveiling
   the Gear only had Path), Ryan Bidan, Director of Product Marketing for
   Samsung Mobile, told us, "There are safe expectations that additional
   social networks are coming in short order."

2. The APIs Are Coming

   While the Galaxy Gear can already take pictures and sense its own
   movement and orientation, the initial set of apps and connected devices
   (namely just one, the [50]Samsung Galaxy Note 3) only scratch the
   surface of what's possible with the device. Samsung plans to deliver a
   set of open APIs to developers so they can engage with all the sensors
   on the Galaxy Gear and leverage its persistent connection to the phone.
   Packingham could not provide an API delivery date, though.

3. Sensors Are the Same

   Even though the Samsung Galaxy Gear is part of a new generation of
   wearable tech, its guts are more similar to a traditional smartphone -
   at least when it comes to sensors. Packingham told Mashable that the
   Gear's sensors are the same as what you'd find in one of their phones,
   though it lacks a compass.

   We asked why the Gear doesn't include something like a heart-rate meter
   -- a perfect fit for wearable tech. Packingham explained that the
   regulations required for those types of sensors are more intense. They
   require "the next level of accuracy." Plus, if consumers want to use
   them in some sort of medical-advisory role, that puts an additional
   burden on Samsung.

4. Why This Smart Watch Can Succeed

   When we asked how the Gear can succeed where, for instance,
   [51]Microsoft Spot watches failed, Packingham first offered an
   admittedly trite answer, "The technology available to us makes a big
   difference," adding, "These devices are genuinely intelligent." He also
   noted that they run actual operating systems (Android) and have access
   to far more real-time data than their ill-fated predecessors. They're
   also more adaptable and flexible, putting for instance, your social
   network on your wrist. Original smart watches had limited technology
   and were, in essence, "one-trick ponies."

   According to Bidan, who was at Microsoft during the Spot era, "the
   technology is finally catching up to the expectations." They also
   believe the smartphone era has helped train and prepare consumers for
   this new age of smart watches.

5. The Band Is Full of Technology

   There's no missing the 1.9-megapixel camera on the Galaxy Gear's wrist
   band, but did you know that the band also includes a speaker on the
   clasp?

   When we quizzed Samsung on the somewhat surprising decision to place
   the camera in the part of the watch that takes the most wear and tear,
   Bidan said, "There is mental sidestepping because it happens to be in
   the form factor of a watch. If it wasn't a watch, we would not be
   talking about the band."

   In other words, Samsung would like of us to think more about the Gear
   as a piece of wearable tech that has technology in all the places
   necessary to be truly useful. So, for example, the speaker in the clasp
   works in concert with the noise-canceling microphones in the watch
   body, allowing you to hold the watch up near your face to conduct a
   phone call (routed through your smartphone).

   Packingham also revealed that while the customer-care plan for the Gear
   should be similar to what Samsung offers for a phone, if your Galaxy
   Gear band is broken or damaged, "a simple change of the band in the
   store is unlikely. You do need tools for repair."

6. You Can Ignore a Call by Placing Your Hand Over the Phone

   Samsung designed the Galaxy Gear to be a glanceable device. If you get
   a phone call on your Galaxy Note 3, the alert will appear on the watch.
   You can glance at your wrist to see who is calling. If you don't want
   to take the call, you just cover the phone with your hand. (Your palm
   does have to touch the screen.) When we asked how the phone knows the
   difference between, say, two fingers and a palm, Bidan credited the
   math behind touch technology, but couldn't clarify if the device truly
   recognizes the difference.

7. Samsung Is Targeting Customers, Not Women

   Samsung's gotten [52]some flack over the size and design limitations of
   the Galaxy Gear, especially from some fashion-conscious women and those
   with particularly small wrists. But when we asked about the possibility
   of designing a "female first" smart watch, Bidan joked "`Female first'
   is a scary rat hole to go down."

   Bidan noted that the Galaxy Gear is just one device. "Samsung isn't a
   company that releases A device," explained Bidan acknowledging the
   company's proclivity for delivering multiple products in a category.

8. Samsung Will Produce More Wearables

   "Will there be additional Gear devices and wearables in our future?
   Sure," Bidan told us. A bag is a possibility. Essentially "you could
   put it anywhere. It's a screen with some tech behind it."

9. Start Charging With a Tap

   Samsung's Galaxy Gear is designed to survive at least a day on a single
   charge, though Packingham insists you can extend battery life "quite a
   bit based on how you configure your device." However, it will likely
   need to charge overnight, every, or every other night. To accomplish
   this task, you'll use the included charging device, which literally
   wraps around the gear body and snaps closed. It has a USB charging port
   in the base and copper connectors inside that match up with the exposed
   copper on the base of the Gear. The charger also has built-in NFC, so,
   according to Samsung, you simply tap to pair.

   answers in our upcoming review. In the meantime, feel free to drop your

The Smart Watch, With a Samsung Twist
       The Samsung Galaxy Gear extends the smartphone experience to a
       1.6-inch screen on your wrist. The smart watch has a lot of
       promise, but it feels like an unpolished device.
    2. Samsung10_edited-1

Screen
       The Gear has a 1.6-inch 320 x 320 touchscreen LCD. Menus look
       crisp, but images weren't the best.
    3. Samsung6_edited-1

Apps
       The screen can display four apps at a time. Users will be able to
       download more Gear apps from a special store.
    4. Samsung2_edited-1

Home Button
       The home button is on the side -- a wise choice.
    5. Samsung3_edited-1

Camera
       The camera is on the strap.
    6. Samsung5_edited-1

Viewscreen
       The camera can capture still pictures and video.

Camera Settings
       You can access some of the basic settings of the camera.
    8. Samsung9_edited-1

S Voice
       Samsung's S Voice assistant is easily accessible via the Gear.
    9. Samsung8_edited-1

Feedback
       If S Voice doesn't hear you, you'll see this message.
