   On Sept. 17, the Pakistani government shut down access to YouTube. The
   purported reason was to block the anti-Muslim film trailer that was
   inciting protests around the world.

   One little-noticed consequence of this decision was that 215 people in
   [59]Pakistan suddenly lost their seats in a massive, open online
   physics course. The free college-level class, created by a Silicon
   Valley start-up called Udacity, included hundreds of short YouTube
   videos embedded on its website. Some 23,000 students worldwide had
   enrolled, including Khadijah Niazi, a pigtailed 11-year-old in Lahore.
   She was on question six of the final exam when she encountered a curt
   message saying "this site is unavailable."

   (GOOGLE+ HANGOUT: [60]Can Online Mega Courses Change Education?)

   Niazi was devastated. She'd worked hard to master this physics class
   before her 12th birthday, just one week away. Now what? Niazi posted a
   lament on the class discussion board: "I am very angry, but I will not
   quit."

   In every country, education changes so slowly that it can be hard to
   detect progress. But what happened next was truly different. Within an
   hour, Maziar Kosarifar, a young man taking the class in Malaysia, began
   posting detailed descriptions for Niazi of the test questions in each
   video. Rosa Brigída, a novice physics professor taking the class from
   Portugal, tried to create a workaround so Niazi could bypass YouTube;
   it didn't work. From England, William, 12, promised to help and warned
   Niazi not to write anything too negative about her government online.

   None of these students had met one another in person. The class
   directory included people from 125 countries. But after weeks in the
   class, helping one another with Newton's laws, friction and simple
   harmonic motion, they'd started to feel as if they shared the same
   carrel in the library. Together, they'd found a passageway into a
   rigorous, free, college-level class, and they weren't about to let
   anyone lock it up.

   By late that night, the Portuguese professor had successfully
   downloaded all the videos and then uploaded them to an uncensored
   photo-sharing site. It took her four hours, but it worked. The next
   day, Niazi passed the final exam with the highest distinction.
   "Yayyyyyyy," she wrote in a new post. (Actually, she used 43 y's, but
   you get the idea.) She was the youngest girl ever to complete Udacity's
   Physics 100 class, a challenging course for the average college
   freshman.

   That same day, Niazi signed up for Computer Science 101 along with her
   twin brother Muhammad. In England, William began downloading the videos
   for them.

   High-End Learning on the Cheap

   The hype about online learning is older than Niazi. In the late 1990s,
   Cisco CEO John Chambers predicted that "education over the Internet is
   going to be so big, it is going to make e-mail usage look like a
   rounding error." There was just one problem: online classes were not,
   generally speaking, very good. To this day, most are dry, uninspired
   affairs, consisting of a patchwork of online readings, written Q&As and
   low-budget lecture videos. Many students nevertheless pay hundreds of
   dollars for these classes -- 3 in 10 college students report taking at
   least one online course, up from 1 in 10 in 2003 -- but afterward, most
   are no better off than they would have been at their local
   community college.

   Now, several forces have aligned to revive the hope that the Internet
   (or rather, humans using the Internet from Lahore to Palo Alto, Calif.)
   may finally disrupt higher education -- not by simply replacing the
   distribution method but by reinventing the actual product. New
   technology, from cloud computing to social media, has dramatically
   lowered the costs and increased the odds of creating a decent online
   education platform. In the past year alone, start-ups like Udacity,
   Coursera and edX -- each with an elite-university imprimatur -- have
   put 219 college-level courses online, free of charge. Many traditional
   colleges are offering classes and even entire degree programs online.
   Demand for new skills has reached an all-time high. People on every
   continent have realized that to thrive in the modern economy, they need
   to be able to think, reason, code and calculate at higher levels than
   before.

   The democratization of education has arrived in the form of these
   moocs. The new mooc wave is a boon for education. For too long too many
   institutions have been charging too much!

   However, there is a distinct lack of coverage on what is going on in
   the mooc scene across the pond. iversity, for example, are exploding (
   [71]https://iversity.org/courses ). They have 3 courses where you can
   get ECTS credits-credits that are interchangeable between in european
   universities. exciting times.

   They say we  need more people with STEM skills.

   Yet college costs are through the room, while competing countries get
   very low cost education and even Microsoft has given out source code
   and opportunities (e.g. training H1Bs, "How Microsoft Conquered China"
   (article from 2007) and plenty of others.

   They say it is a "choice" - well, no degree = no job.  Why do the
   people who say "choice" clam up when asked for details, since a minimum
   wage job will NEVER allow the time needed to get the money to pay for
   college with cash.

   Even teachers, who pay through the teeth, see starting salaries that do
   not allow them to live or pay back debt.

   They say government needs to get out of the way, except private
   industry demands people with degrees relevant to the field.  Colleges
   see this and know that people have no alternative.  The result is
   grossly inflated prices.  That, not government involvement, is the
   'free market'.  Now look up how much taxpayer-funded subsidy is given
   to colleges, private industry, etc, and let's really talk about
   government interference, corporate welfare, why students who want to
   improve their lives in good faith get the short stick while everyone
   else can get forgiveness.

   The system is broken.  Let's fix it here and now.

   Not just college; many high schools in Florida use online training to
   avoid hiring teachers, or even when they don't have sufficient
   certified kids for the AP courses to justify contracting an AP teacher.
   Single girl in my personal son's graduating class took almost all of
   her Senior year classes online (only it was thru FL virtual school
   which is an unqualified catastrophe! Terrible system, confusing,
   inferior materials, not user-friendly or even well prepared). -Dario

   The undergraduate learning experience is not just about pure academics.
   The growth of a student as a positive and productive member of society
   during the undergraduate experience is equally important to the growth
   of their intellect. For most students, the undergraduate experience
   exposes them to all the challenges of life in a safe environment. They
   will interact with people who are vastly different from different
   cultures and discover that we aren't all that different.

   However, I am positive about the evolution of online education. It is
   certainly not a complete replacement for the traditional higher
   education experience. For the undergraduate student, the optimal model
   will need to have the right balance of an online and in classroom
   experience. That model does not exist, but I believe it will be
   developed over the next 5 to 10 years and become the new tradition.

   Before addressing the article I decided to look up the word college.
   What does college mean, I asked?  It seems that there is no meaning
   other than a place one goes to learn something after one has completed
   other education.  But, a college is more than that. It is a place where
   like minded people - professors work. They in turn teach people who
   want to know what the teacher knows about that which the student wants
   to know. That at least seems to me to be what a college is.

   There have been correspondence or what are now called on-line courses
   for years.  Learning in a solitary environment is great for some, but
   not for most. A college  provides motivation to students. It does so by
   providing an environment where learning is held in high regard and then
   again there is the threat of a failing grade and being asked to leave -
   a motivation in its own right.  Now we all know that some students do
   not take all this high regard stuff seriously, but that in no way
   diminishes the environment fostered by a college.

   It seems to me, that if one is highly motivated and well trained in
   basic academic skills, then on-line is fine. In fact, just send that
   person to a good library and turn him/her loose.  The person will walk
   out well versed in that which interests them, but for most - me
   included - the rich environment where learning is held in high regard
   was and is the stimulus that propelled me to gain the little knowledge
   that I have.

   Additionally, a college fosters a sense of curiosity. The professor
   challenges and the nuances conveyed in verbal presentations, queries,
   and give and take occurs in a good class. Does the same occur when
   taking an on-line course?  Does an on-line course foster that sense of
   grasping a concept or bit of knowledge? Do students in on-line courses
   say to the computer as a student can say to the professor: Oh, I get
   it!

   This article, like almost all coverage of online learning, misses the
   timeline of the revolution in online education. MOOCs are the latest
   rage and get lots of press because of the connection to elite
   institutions.  The quote "3 in 10 college students report taking at
   least one online course, up from 1 in 10 in 2003 -- but afterward, most
   are no better off than they would have been at their local community
   college." is indicative of the pervasive, shallow understanding of the
   history.  Right now more than 6 million college students are enrolled
   in fully online, credit-bearing online courses.  That is more than one
   in three of every college student in the country.  And these students
   ARE getting college credit, unlike the students enrolled in MOOCs.
   Tell me, why is it that the author believes that real college credit is
   inferior to a MOOC certificate that, despite the hoopla, is
   unrecognized by the elite institution that provided it when it comes to
   offering college credit?  This is the persistent story of online
   education.  The revolution already happened - online learning has
   already become part of the mainstream of higher education.  But until
   the Ivies get involved (and suddenly "invent" what has already
   been successfully invented) the work of the last 20 years goes
   unnoticed. Its a shame.

   Where can I find more information about this 2011 Science journal study
   or a detailed list of the practices utilized in these MOOC courses that
   seems to be so effective?

   Also, what is the point of the universities partnering with and
   investing in MOOCs if they're not giving college credit? It seems
   one-sided in that the MOOC gets the prestige of being "involved" with
   these universities, but is being mocked as not deserving of the
   credits. So, I'm left confused.

   Any advancement that allows more students to access education should be
   applauded. MOOCs can provide learning opportunities to those who might
   not be able to pursue a traditional college degree program.

   However, there are key differences between MOOCs and online degree
   programs offered by colleges and universities that any student
   considering these options should know. The biggest difference is that
   most MOOCs do not result in college credit. While some institutions
   offer certificates upon MOOC completion, most cannot be applied toward
   a college degree program.

   Also, many colleges and universities foster faculty engagement, provide
   small class sizes, offer student support services, and have 24-hour
   tech support. These advantages are often crucial to meeting student
   needs and improving student success. You can't find these factors in
   MOOCs today. For now, the benefits of MOOCs lie in their accessibility
   and low cost. It's important to note this distinction as buzz continues
   to build around MOOCs and they're compared to online degree programs.

   @KooDooZ  What is your expertise on why the Pakistani government shut

   I am torn between agreeing and disagreeing.
   Isn't drawing new insights (understanding) from reams of data they
   publish whole point about security ?
   In other words, doesn't understanding come at all levels of maturity?
   Could this be deeper or more nuanced levels of understanding, which
   then allows you to adjust what you measure, monitor, manage, and
   control?

   @harvk5 - colleges will shift online to save money.  Instructors will
   get more students because that has more value to the school, even if

   much for that being the reason why costs are so high, so the

   You are right online exists  for the last 20 years mainly by for
   profits to make money .Now 6-6.5 million took at least one online
   course .

   Even state universities are after money. They charge the same fee for
   online while cost is only 1/10 of the f2f.

    I am the great follower of online for the last 20 years. Sloan
   Consortium could not make online famous in 20 years as much as Coursera
   made in 4 months. Shame . VISION . I know Sloan Consortium very well I
   visited them at Babson campus too .

   Because of you old onliners , veterans ,  for profits, online name was
   stained, therefore  elite universities could not go into it . But
   inspite of that. MIT set up a long range plan in 2001 to start OCW. Now
   MIT has 100,000,000 students and customers around the world . MIT
   declared online in December 2011 earlier than anybody . They appealed
   to the world not to the USA. First course has been taken by 15 %
   Americans rest is all foreigners

   ONLINE can be useful only if there is demand by millions , that
   requires brand name for the world. Now there are 1,300 colleges
   offering online courses at $ 1,500 per course .

   Now MIT, Harvard, Stanford will be very successful in NEW ONLINE =
   NOL

   conquering the world with 1 billion students  with quality + small fee
   ( not free ) .

   The old onliners, veterans  caused USA to lose 20 years from nice
   online learning . Today many of you try to critisize  NOL  . You will
   not be successful. No one  can make monees of $ 1 billion a year. You
   know who they are .

   I laugh when you say   "  ...already been invented successfully "  and
   you know now it has gone unnoticed 20 years . It is a shame . One
   company made it noticeable in 4 months .
