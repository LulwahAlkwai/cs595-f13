The Most Boring Squid on Earth?

   [44]squid Much speculation occurs among biologists about the uses for
   all those arms and tentacles in squids.  Eight arms and two tentacles
   seem like appendage overkill.  I do fine with two arms. Well not me
   because I'm uncoordinated, but other humans I hear can achieve amazing
   feats with just two arms.  I have a running theory, developed over
   cocktails, about what all those squiddy limbs are for.  These are not
   thoroughly researched. Yet. Thankfully, crack teams of
   [45]teuthologists spend countless evenings actually researching this
   question as opposed to in addition to just drinking cocktails and
   coming up with hypotheses.

   Most squids possess two long tentacles that can quickly be extended and
   retracted.  The flattened end of the tentacle, called the club, is
   covered in suckers, hooks, or in the most awesome of squids, both.  The
   tentacles and their clubs are highly modified prey capturing machines.
   For squids, clubbing means something entirely different.

   [46]Grimalditeuthis-bonplandi Then there is Grimalditeuthis bonplandi.
   You think with being named after the Grimaldi family, the reigning
   house of Monaco, and the French scientist Aimé Bonpland that this squid
   would be much cooler.  Nope this squid is like the anti-squid, the
   gelatinous slow moving kin of the musculature fast moving squids.  The
   tentacles break easily because they are thin and puny.  These squid
   lack the musculature to quickly, or maybe even slowly, extend and
   retract the tentacles.  The tentacle clubs are devoid of both suckers
   and hooks.  They can't don't even light up the clubs with
   bioluminescence.

   Yep, by all accounts Grimalditeuthis bonplandi is the least cool squid
   on the planet.

   With such insipid tentacles how does this squid even capture prey?
   Grimalditeuthis bonplandi undulates and flaps the clubs...gently. These
   movements may cause other nearby animals to become agitated and
   bioluminescence.  Probably because Grimalditeuthis is so boring.  Or
   alternatively, the movements may mimic the vibrations of small prey or
   mates thereby attracting predators or mates close to the squid. That's
   right Grimalditeuthis attracts other animals to it by acting like
   other, different animals.  Basically, these spiritless movements
   attract prey perhaps even duller than Grimalditeuthis.

               IFRAME: [47]//www.youtube.com/embed/FNHQ56UbiMg

   However as the authors of the new study note, "When a predator exploits
   its resemblance to a non-threatening or inviting object or species to
   gain access to prey, it is referred to as aggressive mimicry. Luring is
   one form of aggressive mimicry..." So, the torpid Grimalditeuthis is a
   least aggressively luring.  Nope, that just makes its creepy.

   Antipathy of Arms

   2 oz light rum
   1 1/2 oz  vodka
   1 oz lime juice
   Fresca citrus soda

   Take 2 oz light rum, 1 1/2 oz vodka, and 1 oz lime juice and shake in
   shaker with crushed ice. Fill highball glass 2/3 full of ice cubes.
   Pour rum/vodka/lime juice mix into highball until 1/2 full-fill the
   rest with Fresca. DO NOT stir.

       Maybe it's to attract a mate!
       Kind of like when I would take my friend's cute lil toddler to the
       store with me to pick up chicks?
       I hope that's it, because now if it's NOT to mate the fact that
       they dangle a tiny version of themselves takes on a slightly darker
       tone.
       That makes it more like us using fake babies on lures to catch
       small bears.
