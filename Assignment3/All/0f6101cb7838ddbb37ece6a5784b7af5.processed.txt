How Carnegie Mellon Increased the Proportion of Women in Computer Science
From 7% to 42%

   [10]25 Replies

   In 1995 Allan Fisher, the Associate Dean of Computer Science at
   Carnegie Mellon University, realized there was a gender ratio problem
   in the department. Only 7% of freshman computer science majors were
   women. So he and Jane Margolis, a social scientist, tried to figure out
   what they could do to change the ratio. By 2000, 42% of the freshman
   class was made up of women.

   These changes not only attracted more women to computer science but
   also made the culture of the department more inclusive for everyone. In
   2004, 30% of undergraduate computer science degrees awarded at Carnegie
   Mellon were to women.

   Here are 4 things they implemented to recruit and retain more women in
   the field:

1. Outreach to high schools

   During 1996 through 1998, CMU set up summer institutes for computer
   science high school teachers where 25% of the curriculum focused on how
   to provide gender equity instruction. 16% of all high school AP CS
   teachers in the nation participated in this program. They also directly
   reached out to high school girls who did well in math and science
   through activities like [12]Technights.

2. A more inclusive admissions process

   In the past, admissions gave preference to people with lots of previous
   programming experience. The new criteria focused on potential by
   targeting students who showed science and math aptitude as well as
   non-academic strengths like leadership. The department made it explicit
   that no prior experience was required.

3. Broaden the scope of early coursework

   Early in the curriculum freshmen learned about various areas of
   research, which introduced them to the broad potential impact of the
   field. New classes focused on how computer science could impact
   society. "Technology Consulting in the Community," for example,
   provided opportunities for students to help non-profits solve
   real-world technical problems.

4. Programs to change peer culture

   [13]Women @ SCS was started to provide support and mentorship for women
   in computer science. A Big Sister / Little Sister program paired
   upper-class and graduate students with freshmen. The organization also
   hosted panels and events that addressed women's issues.

     "The goal should not be to fit women into computer science but
     rather to change computer science." - Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher

   This year 35% of the freshman class is women. For more details on the
   Carnegie Mellon study on gender and computer science, check out
   Margolis' paper [15]here as well as more recent studies [16]here.

   We would love to hear from you. What do you think the implications of
   these changes are?

       I would be interested to see the graduation rates of these
       freshmen. Just because they entered the major does not mean that
       they were welcomed to stay until the end.

                      Notice the rates are not even from the same year as
                      well.

                           Hey there - we took the freshman entry rate
                           from 2000 compared with the graduation rates
                           from 2004. Granted that not everyone who enters
                           CMU will graduate in 4 years, but we felt it
                           was a rough assessment of attrition. I don't
                           think CMU publishes retention rates by major,
                           but I could be mistaken.
                           In the meantime I've contacted Carol Frieze,
                           Director of Women@SCS to ask about what the
                           graduation rates were for the class entering in
                           2000. I'll let you know what her response is!

                 I happen to agree with kenchi, My (crappy) college
                 promotes 99% of it's graduates are employed in the field
                 they studied for, however if you look at it's dropout
                 rates they're astounding, IIRC less than 50% of students
                 make it. However, overall, this seems like good news.

       By 2000, 42% of the freshman class was made up of women.....This
       year 35% of the freshman class is women. Seems to me fewer women
       are attending Carnegie Melon. Unless you meant 35% of undergraduate
       computer science degrees awarded at Carnegie Mellon were to women -
       which would be a 5% increase in # female graduates since 2004.
       Clarify.

            Hey David, yeah percentage of women have gone down since 2000,
            but I think that's partially a matter of refining the program
            and outside variables. Remember that 2000 was the peak of the
            tech bubble, so there was a lot more interest in general in
            the field.

                 Hello,
                 If one looks at your last post, one would notice that the
                 program is just managing to get back to pre-1980 levels
                 of woman participation in these courses.
                 Why would that be so? Do you know of any studies that
                 would explain why the rate of women graduating in
                 computing science went down from 1980- to 2000? One would
                 rather think that women graduates from the 70s would be
                 in positions of power in the organisations recruiting
                 women in the 80s. so why would the rate change in such a
                 way?

       Technology Consulting in the Community is not a CS course. It's
       under a different department. The department does have "Special
       Topics" offerings that don't necessary have a lot of pre-reqs. I
       took one for Mobile Web and there was another one called Software
       Development for Social Good.

       So the implications of the 3rd point are that programming by males
       for the last 60 years has had no impact to the society, and that
       women will have this impact by programming for non-profits.
       How strange!

       The third point doesn't imply that at all.
       As someone currently working at CMU, I'm very happy to hear the
       good news. It could be better, but it's certainly progress. Props
       to Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher.

       Don't get me wrong -- I think CMU is doing a lot of really good
       things.
       But the fact is that after the initial boost back in 2000, CMU has
       lost a lot of ground (42% freshmen in 2000, 35% freshmen today).
       Those freshmen also necessarily don't turn into majors -- this
       recent (February 2013) article:
       [61]http://news.cs.cmu.edu/article.php?a=3570
       says, "Women currently comprise 26 percent of undergraduate student
       majors in CMU's School of Computer Science, while national
       graduation rates for women in CS are below 12 percent, according to
       last year's Computer Research Association Taulbee Survey." (I won't
       comment on the misleading nature of comparing percentage of majors
       to national percentages of graduates...)
       So first of all, those 35% of freshmen majors are going to turn
       into only 26% of majors overall (which, of course, means that
       significantly fewer than 26% of upperclassmen are computing
       majors).
       Second of all, there is an even larger disparity between freshmen
       major rates and graduation rates, at least if you look at the
       2000-to-2004 comparison. 42% of freshmen in 2000 were women; only
       30% of graduates in 2004 were women. That means that the male
       retention rate is 1.7 times that of women. And depending on what
       the overall retention (graduation) rate is, that means women were
       dropping out of the major at a rate anywhere from 1.5 times as
       often as the men (if the overall graduation rate was 50%) up to 14
       times as often as the men (if the overall graduation rate was 80%).
       If you extend this trend, and assume that the male retention rate
       continues to be 1.7 times that of women, for a 35% freshman class,
       the projected graduating class would be down to 25% women.
       Like I said, don't get me wrong; CMU is obviously doing some really
       good stuff. That's twice the national average, and if we could get
       numbers like that at UMBC, I'd be elated. But I'd be equally
       distressed to see that huge retention disparity for women, and at
       the significant overall downward trend within the program. I don't
       think I'd be posting about the great success of the program based
       on something that was accomplished 10 years ago but that has eroded
       significantly.
       (June also says in one of her comments: "Remember that 2000 was the
       peak of the tech bubble, so there was a lot more interest in
       general in the field." Actually, I think this isn't true -- while
       enrollments dropped after 2000, by now they are back up nationally
       to where they were in the late 90s, if not higher. )

            This is fair criticism, and I have to say that when I followed
            a link here I hoped it would be describing what CMU has
            improved further after 2000 (when I was there).
            But I do think that CMU's good work fifteen years ago is still
            worth publicizing in new articles. (I also would rather see
            the emphasis more "work in progress" than "success story", and
            there may not be much disagreement between us.) As you
            mention, lots of institutions still need to catch up with this
            prior work. Even more so in industry, is my impression being
            in industry. All of us can probably stand to ask ourselves,
            has my own organization learned these lessons well, and how
            can I help.

       Congratulations to CMU. Successfully increasing the proportion of
       women in engineering has been rare, and sometimes (often?) even
       backfired. Was the secret to success approaching the audience
       indirectly?

       There was an article in the CMU Alumni magazine ten years ago that
       talked about this trend, and I laughed when I read the quote that
       said, "we've reached 53% (I don't remember the exact percentage,
       but it was between 50 and 55%) women in the SCS department, and
       we're going to keep trying to get that higher."
       I guess the poor minority men should have gotten a cause going to
       boost the percentage.
       I don't know what the "correct" percentage is for enrollment in a
       particular major, but I'd hazard a guess to say that the correct
       answer isn't 50% across all majors.
       I am in favor of exposing everyone to lots of things (there are
       currently sewing patterns sitting on the floor beside me that my
       boys are working on, and my girls help me in the wood shop, all of
       us can cook proficiently).
       7% sounds very low, and the 5 women in my ECE class of 150 students
       was small (my wife is a mechanical engineer), so I think it is fine
       to work on increasing that number, but I think it is important to
       not get confused with the goals, and having systems that look
       anything like quotas. A female mechanical engineer I know says the
       only reason she got into CMU is that she is some percentage Native
       American. While I don't totally agree with that, and think she was
       putting herself down "I wasn't smart enough to get in here", I
       don't doubt that her having a Native American status wasn't part of
       her application, since CMU likes to publish those statistics.

       an MIS degree instead. It's a step, anyway.
