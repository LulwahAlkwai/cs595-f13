[16]Making Science Sexy

   How to Grab - and Hold - an Audience to Promote Science
   By Dan Riskin

   Bringing science to light, Dan Riskin films a scene for the Animal
   Planet series Monsters Inside Me about parasites that can live in
   humans and the stories of people who get them. Riskin's job is to
   explain the biology of the bacteria, protozoans, fungi, worms, and
   insects featured on the show. (Credit: Courtesy of Dan Riskin)

   I'd like to pass on a tip about science outreach that I got from a guy
   who nearly ran me over while he was being chased by three police cars.
   It happened last year during a two-day trip to Los Angeles for a taping
   of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. I would be the second guest
   that night, following some up-and-coming actor named Keanu something.
   It was my sixth appearance on the show and, like every time before, my
   challenge was to throw out hilarious and out-there science factoids
   that would (hopefully) blow Craig and his audience away. For tonight, I
   was preparing a zinger about a flatworm mating behavior called penis
   fencing.

   Even though the Craig Ferguson appearance was happening in just a few
   hours, I wasn't ready. I'd been told by the producers that each of my
   stories had to be down to 30 seconds or less, but I was struggling to
   get the flatworm story down to less than a minute. I needed to explain
   that these were free-living flatworms (not to be confused with the
   parasitic ones), that they were hermaphroditic, and that their unusual
   genital morphology had resulted in the genus name Pseudobiceros, or
   "two false horns." But every time I rattled the story off, it felt like
   a laundry list of disconnected facts, and when I shortened it, what was
   left seemed disjointed. I was starting to worry that I'd have to throw
   the story out altogether, but it was the best one I had. I mean,
   seriously... penis fencing.

   I'm not really trained to be a late-night television guest. In fact,
   I'm not even trained in science outreach. I did my Ph.D. in
   biomechanics, and I've had to figure this media stuff out along the
   way. Because my Ph.D. research involved high-speed videos of vampire
   bats running on a treadmill, it caught the attention of the press, so
   my introduction to science outreach came when I began doing interviews
   about my work with newspapers like the [18]New York Times, radio shows
   like As it Happens and Quirks and Quarks, and a few TV stations. My
   work also showed up on websites like science writer Carl Zimmer's blog
   for Discover, and even the offbeat Boing Boing.

   I enjoyed seeing my work in the popular press, so I actively sought
   those kinds of outreach opportunities as a postdoc, contacting those
   people who had interviewed me before, to tell them about new papers I
   had coming out. I started networking with TV people, making my
   enthusiasm for science as clear to them as I could. One day, I was
   asked to provide some commentary on-screen for a show about evolution,
   and then other odd jobs started coming in. Eventually, I found myself
   choosing between traditional research jobs and ones focused on making
   science accessible to others. After a lot of thought, I leapt the
   fence.

   I now have the great fortune of co-hosting the world's only daily
   science TV show, [19]Daily Planet on Discovery Canada. I also get to
   work on an internationally broadcast Animal Planet show about parasites
   called [20]Monsters Inside Me. And I appear on Canadian news shows
   several times each week to highlight different science stories
   happening around the world, from space station leaks to unusual
   undersea videos and everything in between. In the past few years I've
   discussed hundreds of scientific issues and interviewed more than a
   hundred scientists, engineers, and inventors about their work. Through
   it all, my goal has been to convince people that science makes the
   world more interesting, exciting, and beautiful than it would otherwise
   be.

   That goal hasn't changed, but the way I try to accomplish it has
   evolved a lot. For example, when I was a Ph.D. student in 2005, one of
   the interviews I did about my vampire bat work was on Daily Planet, the
   very show I now co-host. When I watch that interview now, I cringe. My
   answers to the interviewer's questions were logical and thorough, but I
   looked almost bored. I had believed that my high-speed footage of
   running bats was so compelling that it could speak for itself, so I
   hadn't bothered to think about what I'd say. I just showed up and
   answered the questions, confident that one look at a vampire bat using
   a forelimb-powered running gait would make people instantly see the
   intrinsic beauty of biomechanics research.

   Looking back now, I clearly see I was wrong. I've learned that to give
   a successful media interview, you need to decide ahead of time what
   will be discussed, create a list of talking points, and then look for
   ways to hit those points no matter what the questions might be. That
   way the interview will highlight what you think are the best aspects of
   your research, and you won't waste time on material that isn't as
   interesting. (It also helps to wear a decent shirt and to smile, for
   crying out loud--two simple things I failed to do in that interview.)

   Preparing to Look Relaxed

   Even though I've done the show multiple times, I still get nervous
   before Craig Ferguson tapings. Most of the TV I do is pre-recorded, but
   The Late Late Show happens in front of a live audience, with no chance
   for second takes. It's also totally unscripted -- you never have any
   idea where Craig's going to take the conversation. That makes it fun,
   but it also means you have to be ready to fire your stories off in
   whatever order works best, and to deliver the material naturally so as
   not to look over-prepared. It's like cramming for an exam (old familiar
   territory for this academic), except that when you're sharing what you
   know, you will need to act like you're enjoying a cocktail with your
   best friend at the most fun party ever.

   Part of my prep routine for Craig Ferguson appearances is to go for a
   run the morning before the taping to get that nervous
   pace-around-the-room energy out of my system. That day last year, I
   headed out from my hotel hoping the run would also help me figure out
   the flatworm story. Approaching an intersection, I heard sirens coming
   my way. I jogged across the crosswalk, but just as I stepped onto the
   opposite curb, a gray car squealed past, only a few short feet behind
   me. I spun around and then saw three police cars screaming past in
   pursuit.

   My heart was pounding, and my mind was scrambling with questions. Who
   was that guy in the car? Why were the cops after him? Was this going to
   be on the news? What if I'd been hit? Was Los Angeles always like this?
   How many car chases were going on there at this very moment? How would
   that compare to other cities? How would you graph that?

   About ten minutes later, I got back to my hotel room, and looked out
   the window. An entire street about a block from my hotel had been
   closed off and was full of police cars. At one end of the street, news
   crews were setting up. Passers-by had stopped to watch. Soon there were
   news helicopters, SWAT team vans, and ambulances. More and more police
   kept on coming.

   I got on the Internet and saw that Twitter was lighting up about this
   guy. The car chase had apparently happened because he stole a car, but
   now he had climbed up on the roof of a house and the cops were trying
   to get him down. No doubt he'd end up in jail, but for now you had to
   hand it to him -- he really knew how to keep an audience's attention.

   That's when I realized what my flatworm story had been missing.

   How Conflict Can Sell a Story

   I needed to do to the Craig Ferguson audience what the guy in the car
   chase had done to me. I needed to catch their attention and make them
   so curious about penis-fencing flatworms that if I weren't there to
   tell them, they'd go hunt the answers down themselves. To do that, I
   would turn my assorted flatworm facts into a story, with a conflict
   that needed resolution.

   Conflicts that need resolution are what scientists live for. They spend
   their days wrapped up with challenging unsolved puzzles. But those
   challenges and mysteries don't always come out when they talk about
   their work because they are almost always interviewed about the
   questions that they have solved. The secret, then, is to weave the
   excitement into the story.

   Consider what's fun about doing science. There's an incredible thrill
   when you walk up to a mist net, wondering what species of bat you've
   caught, or when you first plot a dataset and see whether it behaves the
   way you think it should. Doing science means peeling back layers to see
   parts of the world no one else may have known before you -- and that's
   exciting, no matter what kind of research you're doing.

   Now consider what an audience gets when listening to someone talk about
   science. The best they can usually hope for is second-hand knowledge,
   with nothing to learn that isn't already known by someone else. It's
   like watching a slide show from someone else's trip to Europe as
   opposed to going there yourself. Since those who are hearing about
   science can't experience one of the most fundamental joys that comes
   from actually doing science, it can help to use dramatic story-telling
   tools -- like conflicts that need resolution -- to send the audience on
   a journey, even if it's a slightly different one from that of the
   scientist.

   With that lesson from my unlikely teacher fresh in my mind, I closed my
   hotel window, had a shower, ate some oatmeal, and got my story worked
   out:

   There's this worm that lives in the water off the coast of Australia,
   with both male and female sex organs, but it has a problem. Every time
   it meets a member of its own species and the two worms want to have
   sex, they have to decide who will be the male and who will be the
   female. Neither of them wants to play the part of the female, because
   the female will have to spend lots of energy growing and protecting
   eggs. All the male will have to do is ejaculate sperm and then swim
   away. So the worms have a penis fight--it's actually called penis
   fencing. Whichever one stabs the other with its penis first injects
   sperm into the other, and then gets to be the dad. The stabbed worm is
   stuck being the female.

   Boom. I was down to 33 seconds. With the adrenaline of the actual
   performance I'd probably shave several seconds off that. By framing the
   facts as a story with conflict, I had learned what to cut. Better yet,
   the conflict-resolution approach would help make people want to hear
   the story. I was finally ready to go.

   Three hours later, the show was taped. We talked about the lengths of
   rhino penises, about male marsupials that die from stress after mating,
   about eating dog poop, and about how, generally, nature will kick your
   ass. Ironically, I never did manage to get that penis-fencing story in
   there. But of course, like an experiment that took a year to perform
   but somehow didn't make its way into your final manuscript (we've all
   been there), a great story can always find a home. I'm working on a
   book now (titled [22]Mother Nature is Trying to Kill You, coming March
   2014), and I plan to sneak the flatworms into that.

   To me, the most important aspect of science outreach isn't helping
   people understand all the details of what we already know, but about
   role modeling the spirit of curiosity that drives the whole process.
   Maybe next time you're talking about your own science to a news
   reporter, a politician, or a late night talk show host (trust me, you
   just never know!), have your talking points ready. And when you're
   crafting those talking points, use the `conflict with resolution' tool
   to give your story an edge. After all, the whole point is to get your
   audience to listen to you. Assuming you don't plan on stealing a car
   and getting up on a roof, telling a good story might be the best way to
   keep that audience's attention -- and to make them care.
