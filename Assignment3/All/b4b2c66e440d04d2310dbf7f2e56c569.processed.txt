[121]And the Genomes Keep Shrinking...

   by Carl Zimmer

   Here are a few numbers about DNA-some big ones, and then some very
   small ones.

   The human genome contains [122]about 3.2 billion base pairs. [123]Last
   year, scientists at the University of Leceister printed the sequence
   out in 130 massive reference-book-sized volumes for a museum exhibit.
   From start to finish, they would take nearly a century to read.

   A typical gene is made up of a few thousand bases. The human genome
   contains [124]about 21,000 genes that encode proteins. There are other
   genes in the human genome that encode molecules known as RNA, but how
   many of those RNA molecules actually do anything useful in the cell is
   [125]a matter of intense debate. A lot of the human genome is made of
   neither protein- or RNA-coding genes. Much (maybe most) of it is made
   up of dead genes and parasite-like stretches of DNA that do little more
   than making copies of themselves.

   As I [126]wrote recently in the New York Times, 3.2 billion base pairs
   and 21,000 genes are not essential requirements for something to stay
   alive. E. coli [127]is doing very well, thank you, with a genome about
   4.6 million base pairs. That's .14% the size of our genome. Depending
   on the strain, the microbe has around 4100 protein-genes. That's about
   a fifth the number of protein-coding genes that we carry. The high
   ratio of genes to genome size in E. coli is the result of its
   stripped-down, efficient genetics. Mutations that chop out
   non-functional DNA spread a lot faster in microbes than in animals.

   E. coli, in turn, has proven to be positively gargantuan, genetically
   speaking, compared to some other species. As scientists explore more of
   the microbial world, they find species with smaller genomes. In my
   column for the Times, I wrote about the record-holding tiny genome,
   belonging to a microbe called Tremblaya. Its genome is a mere 139,000
   base pairs. That's .004% the size of our genome. You could print the
   entire sequence in a single slim paperback you could slip in your
   pocket. And in that sleek genome are just 120 protein-coding genes-.6%
   of our own collection of protein-coding genes.

   Whenever I report on such record-breakers, I try to stress that they
   are only breaking records at that moment. Tremblaya has the smallest
   genome known. Or, I should now say, it had the smallest genome known
   last month.

   This month in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution, Gordon Bennett
   and Nancy Moran [128]describe a new record holder, called Nasuia
   deltocephalinicola. It has a genome of just 112,000 base pairs. Imagine
   taking that slim novella and ripping off the last chapter. Ironically,
   Nasuia packs in more genes into its DNA than Tremblaya-137
   protein-coding genes, Bennett and Moran estimate.

   What's really striking about all these current and former
   record-holders for small genomes is that they all live in a single
   exotic ecological niche. Without exception, they can be found inside
   plant-feeding insects. Tremblaya lives in mealy bugs, for example,
   while Nasuia lives in a leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus).

   Inside those hosts, these microbes carry out chemical reactions on the
   food that the insects eat. The insects feed on sap and other fluids
   from plants, which contains few nutrients. But the bacteria can use the
   compounds floating in the fluid to build amino acids, which the insects
   can then assemble into proteins.

   Leafhoppers, cicadas, sharpshooters, and other related insect species
   carry related versions of the same stripped-down bacteria. By drawing
   their evolutionary trees, Bennett and Moran have found that the insects
   got into a symbiotic relationship with the microbes over 260 million
   years ago. I've reproduced their tree below for those who want some
   gory details. The blue lines show Nasuia and related lineages of
   microbes. The insects also acquired another species of bacteria, known
   as Sulcia. Together, these two microbes split the work for millions of
   years. (In some insects, fungi also jumped into the mix.)

   The ancestors of Nasuia started out as free-living microbes that had
   genomes on par with E. coli. But once they got inside a host, they were
   able to lose DNA without paying a price. The insects gave them a stable
   home, building special organs to shelter them, and they even pass down
   the bacteria to their offspring. The bacteria cast aside many genes
   that might otherwise seem essential, such as a number of genes involved
   in generating energy. All they needed to do was continue to provide a
   service, by synthesizing some amino acids.

   Nasuia holds the record now, but probably not for long. There are many
   other species of insects left to investigate. Moran had John McCutcheon
   of the University of Montana have [129]done some back-of-the-envelope
   calculations to figure out how much smaller the genomes of those
   symbionts can get. All known insect symbionts share 82 genes in common.
   It's possible those genes are absolutely required to survive as a
   symbiont. But a symbiont also needs to provide a benefit to its host,
   or its host will likely get rid of it. It takes at least 11 genes to
   synthesize a single amino acid. Those 93 genes, McCutcheon and Moran
   estimate, could fit in a genome as small as 70,000 base pairs.

   It's funny that these bacteria allow us to probe one of the most basic
   questions about life: how simple life can get and yet still qualify as
   being alive? While [130]those who make fun of science for a living may
   consider such research a waste of time, studying these stripped-down
   organisms is also about as practical as science can get. The
   leafhoppers that house Nasuia, for example, are [131]a nightmare for
   farmers, causing damage to a wide range of vegetables by spreading
   fungi and bacteria. Yet they would be helpless if not for their
   exquisitely simple lodgers. If we can understand how they survive with
   such tiny genomes, we may be able to stop them from enabling their
   hosts.

       By the same criteria (of finding suitable hosts to carry out some
       of the essential features) I hold that viruses also qualify as
       alive.

       Great article! I wonder if mentioning the more traditional examples
       of Evolutionary masterpieces turning Parasitism into
       Commensalism/Symbiosis may not contribute to reinforcing your point
       of the direct relevance to society? Mitochondria, Chloroplasts,
       Azotobacter, Nitrobacter are all dependent host genes and
       residences while repaying hosts by meeting their energetics or
       synthetic needs. Several pathologies are now linked to mutations in
       Mitochondrial DNA.
    3. Kudzu
       August 25, 2013
       But at what point do these symbionts, who cannot survive without
       contributions form their host, cease to be alive and begin being
       part of the host itself?
       Our mitochondria can be considered highly integrated symbionts;
       they reproduce apart from the cell, provide us a very big benefit
       and have bacteria-like DNA.
       What if we find a bacterium that lacks the genes even to read its
       own DNA, relying instead on importing proteins from the host? What
       if we find a bacterium that cannot synthesize anything but a
       beneficial substance for its host? Do we have a working definition
       to draw aline in the sand, this side life, this side not? Do we
       even have a vague idea beyond `We know life when we see it?'
       This is why I only pay attention to the smallest feel-living
       genome. (And yes I have a definition for `free living')

       Seeing as those tiny cellular genomes - you forgot the "cellular" -
       are of obligate symbionts that appear WELL on their way to being
       organelles, I think you have to consider viruses in your "smallest
       genome" stakes.
       And the smallest non-dependent viral genomes are less than 2000 bp
       - the circoviruses! More of which are being discovered every day,
       infecting everything from mammals to birds to who-nows-what, under
       the waves.
          + Kudzu
            August 26, 2013
            See, now ssRNA viroids sound interesting as do circoviruses;
            both seem to be full of interesting biological tricks and have
            interesting lifecycles.
    5. Torbjörn Larsson, OM
       August 25, 2013
       I agree, viruses are living molecular organisms inside cells,
       viroid spores outside.
       Kudzu, if we need "free living" as opposed to co-evolving,
       parasites wouldn't qualify as life.
       But these organisms are more interesting as examples of where
       independent lineages stops and dependent organelle lineages starts.
       As they still migrate with the egg instead of multiply within their
       target cells, they are symbionts rather than endosymbionts. Given
       time they may end up as the latter.
       These organisms don't bear much on the rise of genomes leading up
       to the UCA anyway, since life started out without genes. But they
       interestingly demonstrate that even today's cells don't need much
       genes.

       It's silly and pointless to debate what, exactly, is or is not
       alive ... nature is not carved at the joints by our words.
          + Kudzu
            August 25, 2013
            But if it is silly to debate life then it is equally silly to
            talk about the `essential requirements for something to stay
            alive'. Given that `life' is inherent to this topic I think
            that arguing definitions has a place here.
            Aside from that the world's smallest virus is also an
            interesting topic. It would be interesting to see something
            about it here.

       August 25, 2013
       "If we can understand how they survive with such tiny genomes, we
       may be able to stop them from enabling their hosts."
       It bothers me that when people feel compelled to defend biological
       research, they almost always cite its potential to produce a better
       way to kill. Is life not interesting? Does learning about it not
       enrich our way of being in the world? Don't justify your curiosity
       about minimal genomes by an appeal to industrial applications, Carl
       Zimmer! Resistance to monoculture's corrosive effect on
       biodiversity should come first from those in a position to
       appreciate biodiversity!
       [CZ: Practical applications flow from basic research. We just can't
       predict in advance what those applications will be. While I
       appreciate biodiversity, it won't make the leafhoppers stop eating
       carrots. Monoculture is a problem for many reasons, but even the
       most diversified farm can still be plagued by these insects. The
       fact is that basic research on the biology of these pests may offer
       some ways to fight them. Even organic farmers take advantage of
       microbiology by spraying the bacterial toxin Bt on their crops to
       kill insects.]
    8. Ed Rybicki
       August 26, 2013
       I like to think of "life" as the set of reactions inherent to the
       replication of self-coding informational systems - of which
       biological organisms are a subset, by the way.
       And a subset that spans the range from blue whales to the smallest
       genomes capable of getting themselves replicated, which are the
       naked circular ssRNA viroids - at only 250-odd nucleotides for the
       smallest.
       The fact is, the only organisms capable of surviving by themselves
       on this (or probably any other) planet are those that can make ALL
       their own organic molecules from inorganic substrates, and get
       energy from chemical reactions not involving free oxygen - which is
       itself a product of life. Which means that only chemolithotrophs -
       like the ones found deep underground in solid rock - are truly
       independent lifeforms, as EVERYTHING else - to one degree or
       another - depends on the presence of other organisms and the
       products of their metabolisms.
       And viruses are just a special case, in that they are intracellular
       parasites that use host ribosomes.
       And yes, arguing over what constitutes "life" is a bit like the
       how-many-angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin debate - and equally
       pointless. To bend John Lennon's famous saying, "Life is something
       that just happens while you argue over what it is".
          + Kudzu
            August 26, 2013
            I think debating what life is is an interesting activity in
            and of itself. Pretty much every concept we have, `death'
            `consent' `truth' `species' has no rigid well-accepted
            definition but that doesn't make discussing possible
            definitions pointless.
            Do viruses live? Prions? Chemicals that catalyze their own
            production? There is much to be discussed and learned in such
            debates.

       Here's a nice reductio ad absurdam for you: according to the
       principles of cladistic classification, mitochondria are bacteria
       and the smallest mitochondrial genome is zero base pairs.
