   Just like clockwork, [48]Apple's online store went down Tuesday morning
   ahead of the company's big event.

   Apple is holding a media event at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET at its campus in
   Cupertino, Calif., where it is expected to unveil two new [49]iPhone
   models and the latest version of iOS (you can [50]follow our live blog
   here). The event marks Apple's first major product launch in nearly a
   year.

   The Apple store typically goes down a few hours before the company's
   media events to add new products into the system.

10 Must-Download Apps for New iPhone Owners

    1. F0177b01

1. [52]Instagram
       This photo sharing app boasts compatibility with Twitter, Tumblr,
       Facebook and Foursquare, and has lots of fun filters. Instagram
       isn't just a great way to share your own photos, it's a great way
       to see what photos your friends are taking. As a freebie, this app
       is a no-brainer. It's the kind of quality offering that has made
       the App Store such as huge success.
       Cost: Free
    2. 3f08c89a

2. [53]Cut the Rope
       Starring Om Nom, a little green monster that loves candy, Cut the
       Rope is a surprisingly addictive physics game in which you are
       required to cut said rope in order to drop a sweet into Om Nom's
       mouth. Despite the cutesy premise and child-like graphics, the game
       has received some serious accolades and, as an App Store exclusive
       (for now), is a bit of a jewel in the iPhone's casual gaming crown.
       Cost: $0.99
    3. 1635309a

3. [54]GoodReader
       The iPhone 4 has built-in PDF support, but GoodReader works better
       for large files and has many more features, including support for
       some MS Office formats. It's a great all-purpose document viewer,
       file manager, PDF reader and annotator, so if you're planning to do
       more with your iPhone than play games and take pics, this will
       start you off on the right track.
       Cost: $2.99
    4. 6dfbefc4

4. [55]Hipstamatic
       Apple's iPhone app of the year for 2010 turns the mobile into a toy
       camera. More than just a filter pack, the photographs taken with
       the app have a genuine toy camera feel, with options to adjust the
       film, lenses and even type of flash effect. In fact, you can even
       [56]order analog prints of your snapshots from within the app.
       Cost: $1.99
    5. B655253c

5. [57]Reeder
       Are you an RSS feed fan? Then swallow the cost and download Reeder,
       one of the very best RSS apps around. The app makes Google Reader
       finally worth using on mobile, and browsing is easy thanks to the
       intuitive controls. Besides catching up on your daily dose of news,
       you can share items to Twitter and Facebook.
       Cost: $2.99
    6. A916d00f

6. [58]HippoRemote
       An app that really demonstrates what the iPhone is capable of,
       HippoRemote acts as a remote control for your PC, Mac or Apple TV.
       It's pretty smart as a companion device, especially if you have a
       laptop or desktop hooked up to your TV. The touchpad on it controls
       the mouse, there are programmable macros for certain actions, and
       it's a snap to set up. If you can't afford the price tag, or don't
       need all that functionality, then Apple's [59]free Remote app also
       works quite well for controlling an Apple TV or iTunes.
       Cost: $4.99
    7. 8f9ccb1e

7. [60]Netflix
       If you're a Netflix "Unlimited" member, then this app is a must
       with a capital M. It'll allow you to manage your Instant Queue from
       your iPhone. Better still, you can stream TV shows and movies
       whenever you want, and the really clever part is that you can
       resume watching where you left off on your TV or PC. For
       non-Netflixers, the [61]Hulu Plus iPhone app is also worth a look
       for paid-up subscribers of that service.
       Cost: Free
    8. B8585d11

8. [62]8mm Vintage Camera
       Think of 8mm as Hipstamatic for video. It has "live view"
       functionality so you can see what you're shooting, and there's even
       "projector" sounds to achieve authentically aged footage. You can
       apply cool filters and effects to the video you shoot and then save
       it or upload it straight to YouTube. The app is easy to use and the
       results are surprisingly good.
       Cost: $1.99
    9. Bf6f968f

9. [63]Fruit Ninja
       Not quite as cute as Cut the Rope, but no less addictive, Fruit
       Ninja brings some wholesome, tasty fruit slicing fun, and uses the
       touchscreen to great advantage. We've seen 4-year-olds and
       40-year-olds get sucked into this game -- it's fun, messy and
       boasts great satisfying sound effects. Three million downloads
       later, App Store customers seem to agree.
       Cost: $0.99
   10. D2f292b1

10. [64]Google Mobile App
       If you're coming to the Verizon iPhone from a background in
       Android, this app may will help with the transition. The free
       Google Mobile App will alleviate any homesickness with Google
       Goggles, search by voice, the My Location map shortcut and various
       Google-powered search options. Quick links to other useful Google
       applications also make this a worthwhile download for non-Android
       folk.
       Cost: Free
