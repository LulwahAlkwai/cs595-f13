   Intrade, the popular Ireland-based betting website that allowed people
   to wager on everything from political elections to the [66]Oscars,
   [67]announced Sunday that it is shutting down. Intrade has long been
   under pressure from U.S. regulators, and last November, the Commodity
   Futures Trading Commission sued the website for operating an improper,
   off-site options exchange. Intrade promptly banned U.S.-based traders
   -- which made up the bulk of its users -- from placing bets on the
   site. It's unclear what the proximate cause was for Sunday's abrupt
   shutdown, but the site's operators said they are doing "all we can to
   resume operations as promptly as possible."

   Intrade allowed users to take positions (or contracts) predicting the
   outcome of future events, much as options traders bet that the price of
   a commodity like orange juice or pork bellies will rise or fall. The
   website then aggregated the various contracts to generate the
   probability that a future event -- like the winner of a political
   election -- will occur. By aggregating the collective intelligence of
   its traders, Intrade was able to generate remarkably accurate
   predictions, which made it very popular with journalists and pundits.

   The website shot to fame in 2008, when its users correctly predicted
   that [69]Barack Obama would win the presidential election. Last year,
   Intrade users correctly predicted the electoral outcome of 49 out of 50
   U.S. states (Florida was the exception). In recent days, Intrade's
   users have been [70]betting on the most likely candidate to succeed
   [71]Pope Benedict XVI. (Archbishop Angelo Scola of Italy is the
   [72]favorite.)

   "Speculative markets do a remarkably good job of aggregating
   information," Robin Hanson, an economist at George Mason University and
   consultant to a predictions trading software company, [73]told
   Bloomberg recently.

   In a [74]statement posted on its website, Intrade said that "due
   to circumstances recently discovered" the site is immediately ceasing
   trading activity. "These circumstances require immediate further
   investigation, and may include financial irregularities," Intrade said.
   As a result, the website said it is settling all open positions
   effective immediately. "At this time and until further notice, it is
   not possible to make any payments to members in accordance with their
   settled account balance until the investigations have concluded,"
   Intrade said.

   Last November, the CFTC sued Intrade for operating an unlawful options
   exchange, which among other things, allowed users to bet on U.S.
   economic numbers, gold and currency prices, and even whether specific
   acts of war would occur. The CFTC also charged Intrade with making
   false statements about its website in documents filed with the CFTC,
   and alleged that the website had violated a 2005 CFTC cease and desist
   [76]order. Intrade did not offer users the opportunity to bet on sports
   or stocks.

   "It is against the law to solicit U.S. persons to buy and sell
   commodity options, even if they are called `prediction' contracts,
   unless they are listed for trading and traded on a CFTC-registered
   exchange or unless legally exempt," David Meister, the Director of the
   CFTC's Division of Enforcement, said in a [77]statement at the time.
   "The requirement for on-exchange trading is important for a number of
   reasons, including that it enables the CFTC to police market activity
   and protect market integrity. Today's action should make it clear that
   we will intervene in the `prediction' markets, wherever they may be
   based, when their U.S. activities violate the Commodity Exchange Act or
   the CFTC's regulations."

   Legal)

   The CFTC said that as part of the litigation, it is seeking "civil
   monetary penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and permanent
   injunctions against further violations of federal commodities law."
   Following the CFTC lawsuit, Intrade said in a [79]statement that "due
   to legal and regulatory pressures, Intrade can no longer allow US
   residents to participate in our real-money prediction markets." A CFTC
   spokesperson did not immediately return a call for comment late Sunday
   evening.

   Intrade was founded in 1999 by Irish entrepreneur John Delaney. The
   site raised millions of dollars from investors in Europe and the United
   States, according to documents filed with Ireland's Companies
   Registration Office, which were [80]cited in a 2011 New York Times
   article. Intrade's users correctly predicted the capture of Saddam
   Hussein in 2003, as well as Donald H. Rumsfeld's resignation as defense
   secretary in 2006, [81]according to The Times.

   Delaney died in 2011 at age 42, just 50 feet from the summit of Mount
   Everest, during an attempt to scale the world's tallest mountain. "A
   keen mountaineer who had scaled several of the world's highest peaks,
   John was on his second expedition to Everest, having been beaten back
   by bad weather on his first attempt five years ago," Intrade said in a
   statement at the time, which was [82]cited by The Times.

   So, for the U.S. Government, a couple of million dollars bet with
   InTrade constitutes illegal commodities trading but a couple of
   trillion dollars bet on CDSs don't.  Makes the Gov't look stupid -- or
   maybe not just look.

   It would've been nice to hear the CFTC's reason for considering Intrade
   to be an options exchange in the first place.

   So only the big boys can bet on commodities?  Ridiculous abuse of power
   by the u.s. financial barons.
