[16]The price of the 5C

   September 5, 2013

    At this stage it looks as though everything about Apple's 'cheaper
   phone' has been leaked - plastic casing, choice of colours, '5C' name,
   same screen as the current iPhone 5, and a transparent box to help
   retail sales. Everything, of course, except the price - which is all
   that really matters.

   What price would Apple choose for a genuinely cheaper phone? There are
   four brackets worth looking at:
    1. $100-$150 - this is where budget Chinese manufacturers are starting
       to deliver  usable dual-core 3G Android phones
    2. $150-$200 - the upper end of what is possible to sell to the
       unsubsidised prepay market - which is half the planet
    3. $200-$400 - almost certainly out of reach without subsidies but a
       solid mid-range smartphone price range
    4. Over $400 - similar price to the existing discounted two-year-old
       model, but with more up-to-date technology, possibly higher margins
       and probably an easier marketing sell than the `old' phone

   The first of these price points requires too many product experience
   compromises from Apple, while the leaks we've seen so far seem to show
   a device that would not be priced $200 or under, ruling out most
   prepay.

   So, the decision is where to sit in the mid-range. The interesting
   dynamic in this is the tension between the USA and China.

   The US contract phone pricing structure today effectively puts a lower
   limit on the viable price for a contract smartphone. The ($450) iPhone
   4 and similar high-mid range Android phones are sold as 'free' on
   contract'; phones whose list price is actually much lower are sold at
   the same price. A $200 phone is sold to consumers at the same price as
   a $400 phone - and hence is very uncompetitive.

   One effect of this is that the iPhone 4 and 4S made up a quarter of
   Verizon Wireless contract smartphone sales in Q4 2012 and Q1 2013, a
   much higher share than they appear to have elsewhere. In the USA
   they're as cheap as any contract phone on the market - everywhere else
   they're cheaper than the iPhone 5 but still relatively expensive. The
   Android ASP, after all, is $250-300. Everywhere else $200 and $300
   Android massively outsells $400-$600 iPhone: in the USA much of that
   price advantage is removed.

   So, a $300 or $250 iPhone is a tough sell in the USA. But a $450 iPhone
   is a tough sell in China. Xiaomi, after all, just announced a very
   compelling new phone, [20]the M3, at $330, and that may not be
   [21]staying in China.

   Hence the tension: which is more important to Apple? It already has
   40-45% share of smart sales in the USA, which was just 12% of the
   global smartphone market in Q2. But it can't launch a phone that
   doesn't work at all in the USA (nor is it likely to persuade the US
   operators to drop their pricing to remove this distortion) - which
   points to a higher price, higher spec model. The further you go below
   $400 the more you get a phone that's tough to sell in the USA.

   But too high, and the current dynamic may not change - Apple remains
   camped out in the top 10% of the global handset market while all the
   rest converts to Android - and this is a [22]problem.

   The true unknown in this, of course, is that while we know that any
   $300 iPhone would sell very well, we don't know how much better a
   new $400 or $450 iPhone would sell than the current "two year old" $450
   iPhone. How much difference would the screen, coloured plastic casing
   and 'newness' make?
