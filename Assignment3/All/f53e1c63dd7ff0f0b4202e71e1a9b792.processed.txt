   The London Design Museum Buys And Displays Early 3-D Printed Guns as
   Art.
   What is I think most fascinating is that of all the things that could
   be printed by a 3-D printer guns appear to be the most interesting. I
   think this may be more about the fact that guns remain relatively easy
   to print and are largely technology free. In other words they are
   large, simple, mechanical in nature, and they hold more interest and
   have less of a requirement for design accuracy than say a watch would.
   Still, as art, to my eye they aren't very pretty so they may be more of
   a curiosity than true art. Article on this in Forbes today:
