   MIT biologist [206]Nancy Hopkins visited Houston last week to receive
   the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center's [207]Margaret L.
   Kripke Legend Award for her work in promoting women in science.

   Hopkins is probably most well known for having [208]walked out of a
   lecture by Harvard University President Larry Summers in 2005, when he
   asserted that men may be genetically more predisposed to science than
   women. Hopkins couldn't stomach that after spending much of her career
   trying to equalize opportunities in science for women.

   Interestingly, Hopkins was also inspired by, and worked for James
   Watson during her career. Not surprisingly, she turned out to be a
   great interview. Here, then, is a transcript of our discussion:

   As of today how would you characterize the playing field for women in
   science? Is it level yet?

   It's better than it used to be. There's been a lot of progress but
   we're not quite there yet. There's a lot of understanding of the issues
   and much more progress in how to address them that's been done at many
   universities. But I think it's probably going to take another 10 or 15
   years, with these kinds of efforts, to get there.

   Hopkins at MIT. (Sam Ogden)

   What sorts of issues have you had to address over the years?

   Before the mid-1960s women really couldn't get jobs on university
   faculties, and not many women went into science and engineering. So it
   really was civil rights and affirmative action in the late 1960s and
   early 1970s that opened the doors of universities in the United States
   so women could get in. Then the women's movement, Sputnik, and many
   things happened that pushed more women into science. The pipeline began
   to grow and people thought that's all it would take. They thought time
   alone was going to solve this problem.

   But what we learned is that time alone did not solve it. Even after you
   let the women in there were these invisible barriers that kept them
   from rising to the top. So a generation of women had to get through the
   system and identify what the problems were, and then partner with
   institutions to find institutional solutions to those problems. For
   example, going way back, the first problem they encountered was sexual
   harassment. Whoever imagined such a problem? It took 10 years to figure
   it out and make a law prohibiting it in workplaces.

   Generally when you identify a problem it takes about 30 years to first
   identify, devise solutions, test the solutions and then make sure
   everyone learns about it. Then there was a lack of mentors. And then
   there was the one we worked on at MIT, the undervaluation of women for
   equal work. This is now called unconscious bias. We're about 15 years
   in on that one. I think the remaining problem is the one that we did
   know about early on, but never really addressed, and that is family
   issues. How do you get people to very high level positions, and make it
   possible for both men and women to have families?

   How can the problem of needing time to raise a family be addressed?

   When I started most women like myself chose not to have children if
   they were going to do this job, and that was my choice. I was divorced
   when I was 30, and I chose science. You knew there was no solution. How
   could you work these enormous hours and yet still have a family? When
   we started working on this issue at MIT, in 1995, no woman had ever
   taken a family leave and gotten tenure in science. Women didn't even
   discuss it because the stigma was so great. At that time if a woman had
   a child she kept it secret because it might damage her professional
   career. But it turns out women can have children if you just helped
   them a little bit. You need to make family friendly policies and take
   the stigma out of it. Fairly simple things made an enormous difference.
   The big thing was you could talk about it.

   I note you worked in the lab of [209]James Watson as a fellow, and he
   certainly has had interesting relationships with women. Did that
   experience change you in regard to women in science?

   You probably don't realize what an interesting question that is. I
   actually went into science because I heard Jim give a lecture when I
   was an undergraduate student. I fell madly in love with molecular
   biology in one hour. I ended up working in his lab as an undergraduate,
   and it was he who told me to go to graduate school. I didn't
   particularly want to get a Ph.D., I just wanted to do another
   experiment. The idea, of my generation of women going into science, was
   really remote from anything I'd ever imagined. But he really pushed me
   to go to graduate school. That was the time when the doors of
   universities had just opened. Suddenly, with the affirmative action
   laws, I was offered a job at MIT and Harvard. He was hugely supportive
   of me during that era.

   However, he was not as supportive later on when I took this issue on
   visibly. He was not supportive of my efforts to take up the cause of
   women. I'm not exactly sure why. At the time, when I was young, I think
   we all bought into the notion that science took 70, 80 or 90 hours a
   week, and how could you ever be a mother with those hours? Initially I
   thought that was the only problem, and that if you didn't have children
   there would be no problem. But what I learned as I went through my
   years of being a scientist is there were additional barriers that
   prevented women from being accepted fully into the profession. I think
   Jim never really came to agree with that, or believe it, and it
   bothered him that I had spoken out on that issue.

   I recently [210]did an interview with the successful astrophysicist
   Natalie Batalha, who told me that as a young woman scientist she found
   herself constantly underestimating her abilities. Is this fairly common
   among women scientists?

   We do see it even today in our students, and we don't understand it. We
   see women students who have less confidence in our male students. Even
   when women are doing better, and we hear this from many professors,
   they come to their teachers with concerns about their grades. But men,
   let's say they're getting a C or failing, talk about how they're going
   to master the material. So there's a difference in confidence level.
   What's really important is an emergence of understanding that both men
   and women undervalue work if it's done by a woman. So there's this
   bias. So yes, women are battling this, and it's a real phenomenon
   that's been documented in studies.

   Have you spoken to Larry Summers much since the 2005 lecture he gave?

   Only through the press. Actually, after the original event we did have
   a communication or two. I got a lot of hate mail, and one of them was a
   fake e-mail that appeared to come from Larry Summers, telling me what
   he thought of me in no uncertain terms. So I shipped it over to some of
   my pals at Harvard, thinking it probably was a fake, which it was, and
   he wrote me back an apologized for what was happening. I suggested we
   write an article or give a talk and explain why the comments he made
   were factually wrong, why there's no genetic evidence for any group of
   people to be inferior to others in abilities relevant in science and
   engineering. He said he would think about it, but I'm still waiting to
   hear back. That was six years ago so I don't think he's going to call
   soon.

   More women today are getting college degrees than men. Do you envision
   a day when there are more scientists who are women than men?

   The only field of science and engineering in which there are more women
   than men, in the undergraduate years, is biology. Conversely, if you
   look at the science and engineering faculty at MIT today, it's 18
   percent women. You look at the engineering faculty, it's 16 percent. A
   huge national problem is the failure of women to go into engineering,
   which is contributing hugely to the shortage of engineers in this
   country. So women are unlikely to take over any time soon. I do worry
   very much about those numbers shifting. I worry about why more women
   than men are going to college, and I'm concerned about more women than
   men in biology. But those numbers aren't yet translating up to the top.
   You still see a tremendous underrepresentation of women at the top. So
   you've got to worry about the bottom, where it's shifting, and you've
   got to worry about the top, where it isn't shifting.

   You're worried about fewer men going into science in college, at least
   in biology?

   Yes, it bothers me a lot. Why is it happening? We need to understand
   this.

       Oh please.
       This has to be the most biased interview I have seen this year.
       I have seen a test grade go from an 84 to a 90 when a
       girl rubbed her chest up against a teacher's back and
       field trips with 2 people in a professor's sleeping bag.
       I have heard a professor admit that female crotch exposure was
       so common in his class that he did not focus past the edge
       of his lectern during his whole lecture, and I have seen lab
       assistant
       positions lead directly to an Mrs.
       Sexual harassment and all that other stuff are too often just games
       women
       play to seek an advantage.
       I have known and respected a few female students and scientists
       where this was not the norm, but to act like the female student is
       not as much a player in the game
       is unconscionable.

       Excellent interview with an interesting and inspiring person.
       Remembering my own experiences with female geoscientists in all
       careers during the mid-70s to mid-90s, so much changed and it seems
       today over half are women when there were few in the '60s. And my
       wife's experiences with CPAs and the Big 8 (now Big 4) accounting
       firms in the 70s to '90s is very similar to Dr. Hopkins'
       experience. It is good women like this take on the battle in their
       fields, so many have and the results show today. I am proud she
       helped out one of my alma maters too, MIT really needed help in
       this regard many years ago, and even though not where it should be
       in science and engineering, progress is being made and other areas
       are much better and are close to being there.

       To answer the last question: Because there's more money to be made
       in other fields. With so many people taking out student loans (and
       needing to pay them back) they're going to select fields with
       bigger paychecks. Adding to that, what about the number of
       available positions? There are more jobs out there for engineers
       than biologists.

            Because there's more money to be made in other fields.
            You've definitely named one of the primary factors, but it
            should apply to women as well as men. In my case, I could work
            as a planetologist for $60,000/year (if I'm lucky) or in
            [233]the oil and gas industry for more than twice that. The
            science is the same (for the most part), and I get to work on
            projects that don't take twenty years to get built.

       Obviously (or maybe not, given one's point of view) women like this
       should not have to choose between contributing to science and
       having kids. Not only do these women deserve both, if they so
       choose, but we as a species need those genes circulating freely in
       the pool.

       I sure hope that statistician extraordinaire JohnD is available to
       comment on this post and what I'm going to say below in response to
       it, because we sure as heck could use his expertise on this.
       JohnD, correct me if I'm misunderstanding the 2005 events
       referenced above, but Larry Summers was demonized in the press and
       sacrificed on the altar of political correctness for simply stating
       (or at least shrewdly inferring) a scientific observation that has
       NOT been disproven, that very well may NEVER be disproven, and that
       is consistent with my personal qualitative observations over many
       years of intensive academic competition: the standard deviation of
       men's intelligence might be as much as 20 percent greater than that
       of women's intelligence.
       To my knowledge, Larry Summers NEVER claimed that men were
       "smarter" than women or "more capable". He simply said that the
       TAILS of the IQ distribution appear to be different (an observation
       that has been supported by studies not connected to him), and that
       those differences are potentially enough to explain why there are
       more men in the top academic echelons of STEM fields than women
       (one reference: Ian Ayers, "Super Crunchers", see pp. 225-230 in
       the 2007 paperback edition).
       It is EXTREMELY important to be as clear as possible on the FACTS
       of this issue irrespective of personal reactions to those facts,
       and irrespective of any ameliorating policies that may subsequently
       be applied in response to those facts in order to maximize any
       defined socioeconomic outcome. I'm not gearing up here to argue
       that a status quo of preferring men to women in the STEM fields is
       preferable because there are numerous genuine indirect and
       intangible benefits that can be derived from promoting gender
       equality in higher education. I'm just talking about the raw
       statistics and how we deal with them both individually (as women)
       and collectively.
       If we ignore or disavow the statistics that Summers referenced, we
       disavow the scientific method in its entirety. With that kind of
       mentality, we might as well start doing rain dances the next time
       we get hit with a drought interval.
       Disavowing reality is never in the best interest of anyone. Let's
       accept for the moment that the spread of men's IQ really *IS* 20%
       greater than that of women. Let's accept that for the sake of
       argument because, to my knowledge, it has been roughly measured as
       such in some studies, and not subsequently been disproven by other
       studies.
       What's the best recourse for women scientists and women STEM
       students in the face of that statistic? Is their best course of
       action to get all huffy and "walk out" every time they hear that
       statistic stated? To such women I would say - way to play right
       into the age-old histrionic female stereotype, gals. Do you think
       that you're doing women in science a FAVOR by acting that way? You
       might get some immediate ego-traction in the "if it bleeds it
       leads" press, and you might get traction in the simple-minded court
       of public opinion but, in the LONG run, if you disavow the very
       scientific process the virtues of which you so passionately claim
       to extol, you're going to lose, and you'll drag every other woman
       in science down with you.
       And worst of all, if you behave that way, you'll miss the
       opportunity to understand where your REAL power lies, and where
       your REAL potential for advancement in STEM is to be found: in the
       very physiological differences that created those statistical IQ
       tail distinctions in the first place. The *average* IQs of men and
       women may not be different (a fact that Summers also apparently
       noted), but the male and female brains ARE different by design. In
       vernacular terms, men do certain things better than women, and
       women do certain things better than men. By embracing rather than
       denying the 20%-ish statistical tails difference in IQ, we can then
       move forward to identify and leverage those areas where WOMEN have
       THEIR respective 20%-ish advantages.
       And those feminine advantages DO exist. Allow me to illustrate it
       by telling my particular story, as a female scientist.
       I set a goal for myself within one week of entering university as
       an undergrad: at graduation, I would take that institution's top
       medal in my field of scientific study.
       The competition was one hell of a lot tougher than I expected it to
       be. I was accustomed to being "smarter" than most people, but what
       I didn't expect was to have to admit to myself that there were two
       men in that program who were simply smarter than I was. I could not
       for the life of me understand how they were able to do what they
       did - the workings of their brains were simply beyond my reach. I
       scrutinized those guys DAILY, for four long years! - the careful
       (OK, obsessive) study of their methods was part of my overall
       competitive strategy. And they were simply smarter, every step of
       the way.
       - BUT --
       Acknowledging their superiority in that one isolated area (raw
       intelligence) also allowed me to recognize those areas where those
       men were NOT as capable as I was, and there proved to be two of
       them:
       (1) They did NOT have eyes in the backs of their heads, the way I
       did. Any construct that they got hold of intellectually, they would
       thrash me on. But simultaneously, they missed a lot more than I
       did. Women evolved to ensure that no toddler under their care
       wanders into a creek and drowns or eats poison berries when nobody
       is watching. So women watch. They watch EVERYTHING. Women are more
       finely calibrated to let no observation elude their awareness, no
       matter how subtle. This is a powerful advantage that can be
       re-directed and leveraged in the STEM fields. If you're a really
       smart guy but you only register 93% of the constructs to which you
       are exposed, you're going to be out-done by the woman who maybe
       does not grasp them quite as deeply as you do, but who grasps all
       100% of them including that 7% that you utterly failed to even
       notice let alone master.
       (2) Those men were simply not capable of communicating as
       thoroughly as I could. If you are a guy who understands 100% of
       some scientific thing but are only able to clearly explain 90% of
       it, you will be un-done by the female who understands 95% of that
       thing but is correspondingly able to explain 100% of that 95%.
       My academic competition was so severe that, if I had let my guard
       down for EVEN ONE DAY in those entire four years, I would have lost
       that medal. The competition was so intense that if I had failed to
       admit REALITY to myself (that the men were smarter), I would
       *never* have been able to identify my own competitive advantages.
       The rest is personal history: as far as the professors could
       determine from the available institutional records, I was only the
       second female student ever to win that particular medal for
       achievement in science, in a post-secondary institution that has
       figured prominently in the advancement of science since its
       inception in the mid-19th century.
       If women are truly motivated to succeed in the STEM fields, they'll
       find the reality in this whole IQ fracas, and then they'll build
       from there. They won't win (in fact, they won't even gain real
       confidence in themselves) via the routes of power-posturing and
       playing gender cards. I very much look forward to seeing future
       studies that further elucidate the differences in male and female
       IQ distributions. I only hope that the topic is not so politically
       incorrect that nobody is able to touch it, because that would be a
       tremendous loss for all of us.

            might be as much as 20 percent greater than that of women's
            intelligence.
            Here's a link to what he actually said:
            [237]http://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.pres
            ident.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html
            He never provided any hard-and-fast numbers in his speech; he
            merely stated that he thought that men outnumbered women by
            five to one at the highest levels of the field. He misquoted
            [238]XIe and Schauman in support of his allegations, and
            misused the statistics to support it. Basically, what he did
            was the equivalent to saying that people in the 1930s were
            shorter on average than people in the 1990s and therefore
            people in the 1930s couldn't be as tall as people in the
            1990s. The error in that should be obvious.
            He also derided the fairly well-accepted hypothesis that one
            reason that women are under-represented is because they are
            typically given lesser and lower posts to start with based on
            the assumption that they'll just quit in a few years to go
            home and have babies so why waste a tenured position on them?
            (NB: Not my position on this, but a [239]well-documented bias
            in the field.) What he fails to understand is that academic
            rank is much like compound interest; if you are given a little
            more to start with, you end up with much more at the end of
            your career.
            And he also tries to make a case for a purely laissez-faire
            solution, expecting that universities will try to pick up
            female scientists on the bargain rack (as it were), given that
            there is not a strong market demand for them ("If it was
            really the case that everybody was discriminating, there would
            be very substantial opportunities for a limited number of
            people who were not prepared to discriminate to assemble
            remarkable departments of high quality people at relatively
            limited cost simply by the act of their not discriminating,
            because of what it would mean for the pool that was
            available.") As anyone who remembers the 1950s (or their
            history) can attest, that solution is non-tenable.
            All in all, his speech was ethically, scientifically, and
            morally repugnant.

            I'm sorry, Alisonymous, there was one other point that I meant
            to address:
            Disavowing reality is never in the best interest of anyone.
            Let's accept for the moment that the spread of men's IQ really
            *IS* 20% greater than that of women. Let's accept that for the
            sake of argument because, to my knowledge, it has been roughly
            measured as such in some studies, and not subsequently been
            disproven by other studies.
            The truth is that IQ is a very shaky predictor of future
            success. Many surveys have shown that [241]the correlation of
            IQ to success is moderate at best, with many other factors
            (environment, opportunities, self-worth) playing large parts
            as well. Indeed, some have posited that the main predictor of
            success is not IQ per se but [242]the ability to use that IQ
            via "working memory" (think of it as being the difference
            between the disk drive {IQ} and the processor {working memory}
            on a computer; a huge disk drive does you little good if your
            processor is too small or slow).
            Of course, as is always the case with human research, the
            results are controversial. But the bottom line is not, and
            echoes what Dr. Hopkins said above - it isn't nature or
            nurture; it is both.
          + Alisonymous says:
            [243]March 26, 2012 at 10:13 am
            I re-read his speech and I don't find it "morally repugnant".
            Moral repugnance is a subjective experience, and as such is a
            manifestation of:
            (1) the ego (as ego as defined strictly in terms of `the self'
            without undue weighting of the self-esteem component of the
            self, which is what tends to happen when the term is used in
            common American speech). If there's one place where ego
            absolutely does not belong, it's in science.
            (2) social tradition, which is mostly arbitrary and often
            antithetical to science.
            Even so, ego and subjective responses to tradition can both be
            useful in stimulating science even as both must be vacated for
            the resulting science to be valid: simply put, if something
            really p*sses you off on a personal level, it might serve as
            an inspiration for investigating that issue in a scientific
            context.
            Not only do I NOT find Summers' discourse to be morally
            repugnant, I was actually struck by the extent to which he
            assumed it would generate additional inquiry -- which is the
            entire point of academic discourse! "I will have served my
            purpose if I have provoked thought on this question and
            provoked the marshalling of evidence to contradict what I have
            said," he included in his closing remarks.
            The question remains: has anyone actually used his galvanic
            discourse to marshal any evidence to contradict what he said?
            Or did they all just stomp around huffing their repugnance and
            leave it at that?
            Ayres gave it a preliminary shot and declared the following,
            among other things: "I've recalculated Summers's estimates,
            using his same methodology, and his bottom-line
            characterization of the results, if anything, was
            understated." Ayres also referenced other studies (other than
            Xle) that found that different IQ standard deviations do, in
            fact, exist (and if you parse Ayres, you'll find that he's no
            lightweight). He did not reference A LOT of other studies and,
            at this point, only Ayres knows the reason for that, but I
            suspect that A LOT of other studies have NOT yet been done
            because if they had been, this question would be better
            illuminated by this time.
            JohnD, you went into an analysis of Summers' speech when in
            fact my point was to ask you if you had any input on the
            standalone existence of statistics for or against, because you
            have proven that statistical analysis is one of your fortes. I
            was interested in JUST the statistics. Forget about the
            contributing factors WHY a standard deviation difference may
            exist - everyone realizes that the forcings on the size of the
            sigma may be varied and may include much more than just
            chromosomal influences. For the purposes of immediate
            analysis, it does not matter WHY those differences exist, and
            for this analysis it doesn't matter what society ultimately
            does in RESPONSE to them - it only matters WHETHER differences
            exist.
            And from the limited direct plus circumstantial evidence I see
            before me right now, it appears that such differences very
            well might exist. I don't know what's more profoundly telling
            - the fact that those differences exist based on what we know
            right now, or the fact that only a few of us (me and Ian
            Ayres, at least) appear to be willing to talk about THE
            NUMBERS (as opposed to our personal FEELINGS about those
            numbers) straight up. On this very blog, a whole big
            headlining stink was made a few months ago over the fact that
            John B. Anderson was "muzzled" by TCEQ when he tried to make
            climate change statements (in fact, the truth of that event
            was infinitely more nuanced than that, but let me not get into
            that tangent). So where is the analogous reaction to what
            happened to Summers? Sure, the guy was a bit obnoxious and his
            political skills were clearly not up-to-task, given his
            position. But if being obnoxious were a crime, society would
            have seen to it that MY jaws were permanently wired shut
            almost half a century ago. It is often only WHEN people are
            intentionally obnoxious that others get galvanized into
            resolving questions such as this, resolving them one way or
            the other so that the moving-forward into new realms of
            awareness can then begin.
            Objectively speaking, both Larry Summers and John B. Anderson
            were effectively shut down. But the official version seems to
            read more toward the conclusion that John B. Anderson was
            muzzled while Larry Summers was simply dismissed. I find that
            deeply troubling.
            In sum, the lady interviewed in this blog post walked out of a
            presentation in which this question of IQ distributions was
            raised. Did she actually contribute anything to the specific
            scientific dialog besides her own righteous indignation? Did
            her subjective reaction inspire her to commence controlled
            studies to confirm or deny the existence of what got her so
            p*ssed off in the first place?? Or did she at least make an
            effort to investigate the presence or absence of third-party
            controlled studies in the literature and report back on the
            results of same? Not that I can discern.
            We conspire to validate conversation-stoppers in this society
            when those conversation-stoppers serve our ego interests, even
            as we call ourselves `scientists'. We give them achievement
            awards. And we hold them up as performance models without
            fact-checking what they say (e.g., I don't know where she got
            this gross generalization that women scientists with babies
            did not get tenure twenty years ago... I began my
            post-secondary education THIRTY years ago under the direct
            supervision of two female scientists who both handily got
            tenure - absolute intellectual powerhouses they were - and
            both had babies. One had two babies and the other had three
            babies!!). How are women in science served by ANY of this?!
            How is ANYONE served by any of this?!
            There's far more that could be said and that NEEDS to be said
            on this topic, but because of the unfortunate weekend timing
            of the blog publication, it's in the process of being OBE, so
            I'll stop here.

            refuted, they had been refuted numerous times before he spoke.
            His speech showed that he was at least a decade behind the
            times in terms of both research and actual progress. That's
            why I found it scientifically repugnant.
            Ayres gave it a preliminary shot and declared the following,
            among other things
            I haven't read Ayers, but the [246]critical reviews of his
            work are not promising. The most telling part is that he has
            published his stuff as a popular book (with no peer review)
            instead of as papers (with peer review). I am also somewhat
            worried by his apparent insistence that you don't need any
            theory, just piles and piles of data. That is an obsolete form
            of inquiry that presumes (1) that you know what questions to
            ask and (2) that the answers are actually in the data. (For
            the record, I have created similar programs for oil companies
            to help highlight prospects, but they incorporate a strong
            dose of geophysical knowledge.)
            I suspect that A LOT of other studies have NOT yet been done
            because if they had been, this question would be better
            illuminated by this time.
            You'd lose that bet. IQ and its variations among populations
            is a perennial favorite research topic. Heck, it is even
            fundamental to several NSF research areas. The problem is that
            IQ is poorly defined, hard to measure, and not as
            deterministic as many would claim.
            JohnD, you went into an analysis of Summers' speech when in
            fact my point was to ask you if you had any input on the
            standalone existence of statistics for or against, because you
            have proven that statistical analysis is one of your fortes.
            Sorry, my misunderstanding. His use of statistics was wrong
            and he provided no support for his statistics. He took one
            place on the curve (two sigma) and extrapolated it out without
            knowing what the true relationship was (he admitted this in
            the talk). That's like saying that because most people drive
            faster than 50 on the highway, there must be a lot of people
            who drive faster than 100 (excluding me, of course...).
            Equally wrong was how he used the statistics. As I noted
            above, he said that because he thought that there were fewer
            women than men at the top of the field, there had to be fewer
            women than men at the top of the field. That is neither proper
            statistics nor proper science.
            Let me expand on my counter-example a bit to show you why. It
            is well known that [247]the average height of American males
            has risen by an inch over the past century. Thus, if you were
            to make histograms of the heights for "the Greatest
            Generation" and for "Millenials", you would see a distinct
            shift in the peak. In addition, you would find that there were
            proportionally more Millenials who were over 6' than there
            were Greatest Generationals.
            Is this difference because the members of the Greatest
            Generation couldn't grow that tall? No. By and large, it was
            because nutrition and medicine have improved over the past
            century, allowing the Millenials to come closer to reaching
            their maximum potential, height-wise. This is also seen in the
            data; the difference between Millenials and Boomers is almost
            zero, which is to be expected given that both generations were
            raised in an era of plentiful nutrition and high quality
            medical care.
            Now let's think about Summer's statements. He claims that
            simply because there are fewer women with a high IQ, women
            must necessarily be less intelligent than men and therefore
            less suited to science. But we know that IQ is not a strong
            determiner of success in science, so his argument fails on
            that point. We also know that [248]IQ tests show strong gender
            biases, which means that the metric is erroneous. Finally, we
            know that [249]IQ is strongly influenced by social and family
            factors. Thus, given that there are social factors which tend
            to drive female IQ downward (e.g., the old Dorothy Parker
            quote about women and glasses), his argument fails again as
            women are not inherently less intelligent than men (just as
            GGs are not inherently shorter than Ms).
            Forget about the contributing factors WHY a standard deviation
            difference may exist - everyone realizes that the forcings on
            the size of the sigma may be varied and may include much more
            than just chromosomal influences.
            You have to understand why the deviations exist or you cannot
            comment meaningfully. That's why I brought in the analogy of
            height; it is intended to show that knowing the cause of an
            effect can help you determine if the effect is intrinsic or
            not.
            I don't know what's more profoundly telling - the fact that
            those differences exist based on what we know right now, or
            the fact that only a few of us (me and Ian Ayres, at least)
            appear to be willing to talk about THE NUMBERS (as opposed to
            our personal FEELINGS about those numbers) straight up.
            Here you are simply wrong. There are plenty of folks talking
            about the numbers. But they are also trying to understand what
            drives the numbers. Until you know what causes a phenomenon,
            you cannot begin to attempt a corrective action - or even know
            if one is needed or possible.
            So where is the analogous reaction to what happened to
            Summers?
            The difference being that Anderson was speaking from a
            position of well-established science, and Summers was speaking
            from a position of long-discredited excuses. And please
            remember that Summers wasn't dismissed over this (though it
            may have been a contributing factor); he resigned when Harvard
            lost over $1 billion on the financial market after following
            his advice.
            Did she actually contribute anything to the specific
            scientific dialog besides her own righteous indignation?
            Yes; she even tried to work with him on the topic. Re-read the
            interview: "I suggested we write an article or give a talk and
            explain why the comments he made were factually wrong, why
            there's no genetic evidence for any group of people to be
            inferior to others in abilities relevant in science and
            engineering. He said he would think about it, but I'm still
            waiting to hear back. That was six years ago so I don't think
            he's going to call soon."

            Also, don't ignore the unreliability of IQ tests when moving
            away from the mean. Above about 140 or so and below about 60,
            the tests do not return valid numerical results. Comparison
            between individuals with scores of '160' and '180' is not
            possible. It's like a car that has a speedometer up to 85 mph.
            Trying to compare 100 mph vs 110 mph doesn't result in good
            data.
            For that matter, at the very high IQ ratings, the individual
            should know how to game the system. The specific IQ test used
            will also result in variable readings. Finally, high IQ is no
            guarantee of anything - the famous case in point is Kurt
            Godel, who died of starvation when his wife was hospitalized
            for six months.
            Below an IQ of about 60, there can be trouble determining if
            the subject understands the questions, muhc less the `right'
            answer.

            You just reminded me of a practical joke that a group of my

            We all decided to do our best to score in the low to mid-70s
            on our IQ tests in the class (I managed a 72 - the first time
            I've ever been happy to see that on a test!). The professor
            was very confused by the results until we all started to
            laugh. She then turned the event to her advantage by switching
            the topic to "[252]faking good".

            I was reminded yesterday of why I read quality blogs: because
            the learning is deeper when the context is personal. And the
            context becomes personal when one participates wholeheartedly
            in the process. This opportunity for participation is distinct
            from our typical mode of daily learning: passive absorption of
            what the Information Age spews forth in vast volumes, largely
            through its principal carrier the internet. All that
            making-science-headlines stuff that we read is very
            interesting and even illuminating, but it can never hold a
            candle to direct, goal-driven personal investigation of the
            type we're doing right here in this thread.
            Part of that participatory investigative process involves
            re-accessing "settled knowledge" (I use that term loosely for
            lack of a better one). And what I found yesterday is that the
            "settled knowledge" regarding IQ is not at all what I thought
            it was when we began this thread.
            But before I get directly into that, I'd like to ask one more
            question of JohnD, and this is a bona fide question, not a
            defensive reaction on my part: at what point did we as a
            profession start blurring the boundary between observation and
            interpretation, and why did we start doing that? Let me
            explain the basis for this question and my assertion that it's
            judgmentally-neutral on my part. I was brought up in an
            insanely-rigorous scientific disciplinary environment. My
            former PI has the distinction of being known as "the father
            of" a particular sub-discipline. Most grad students wouldn't
            even consider joining his team because he was too intimidating
            (JohnD, you'd know his name if I said it). And one of the
            things I was taught through all those years is that the
            cardinal sin of science is failure to draw the bright line
            between observation and interpretation. Mentally, you have to
            share those magical come-to-Jesus moments with the data before
            you even consider forming interpretations about those data.
            And then even after you form an interpretation, you better
            remain no more than one hairtrigger moment away from revising
            that interpretation upon the receipt of additional data,
            because new data WILL come, and they WILL matter. Wanna incur
            the Wrath of PI? Slip into the trap of becoming vested in your
            interpretations. I shudder to think.
            This is why, when I read statements such as this: "You have to
            understand why the deviations exist or you cannot comment
            meaningfully" my alarm bells start going off. Part of such
            understanding is to acknowledge the quantitative limitations
            inherent in any measurement - yes. But part of that
            understanding often turns out to be purely interpretive. And
            we can never allow interpretations to foul the observations
            upon which they are based. When I see folks expounding upon
            why apparent IQ differences exist, a lot of what I detect
            seems like it is strongly interpretational rather than
            objectively explanatory.
            That being said, I do realize two related limitations that
            potentially apply to me: number one, the most rigorous part of
            my education ended two decades ago when I transitioned from
            grad school followed by employment in a de facto post-doc
            assignment into the private sector. The very methodology of
            scientific thinking itself may have evolved since my departure
            (or at least the bleeding edge of that thinking). Number two,
            because I switched my career trajectory, I wasn't able to keep
            up with any such developments that may have taken place in the
            intervening years, for lack of exposure. Therefore, I may be
            genuinely ignorant of such developments. You (JohnD) seem very
            sure of your assertions, and you ain't dumb. Therefore, this
            may be reflective of some developments in meta-cognitive
            procedure of which I'm not presently aware. If such do exist,
            I'd invite you to expound upon them.
            Now, with that out of the way, let me explore my "settled
            knowledge" statement.
            With respect to IQ distributions, I have necessarily had to
            limit myself to reviewing a few meta-analyses (I do have a job
            and a family that demand my attention), but what I found
            surprised me. I found that the measured IQ differences between
            males and females in certain STEM-related functional
            capacities are well-documented and readily-acknowledged.
            You could jump right in and assert that it shows up like that
            because the tests are flawed, and you could note that IQ
            measurements are not a great success predictor, but if you do
            that, I think you're going to run the risk of overlooking the
            fruits of those come-to-Jesus data-embracing moments, the
            fruits that exist irrespective of any subsequent
            interpretations and explanations that you or others may apply.
            And those fruits are critically important. Taken on their face
            AS data, without compulsive attempts to explain them away, I
            believe that they hold the key to much of this puzzle of
            promoting the progress of women in science.
            Neisser et al., in their seminal 1996 compendium (reference at
            end of post) noted that there are "large differences favoring
            males" on visual-spatial tasks - the "mean of the male
            distribution is nearly one standard deviation above that for
            females" (One sigma?! That's *massive*!). They also noted that
            males demonstrate a "substantial advantage" on math SAT scores
            "with many more males scoring in the highest ranges" and that
            "males also score consistently higher on tests of proportional
            and mechanical reasoning".
            My come-to-J moment yesterday upon reading these things was,
            "Holy crap. These effects are MUCH more pronounced than I had
            previously been led to believe." I was identified at a very
            early age as having academic potential. Throughout my entire
            educational experience, I was subjected to the mantra "girls
            are just as smart as boys" from every side - from family
            members, from teachers, and then in the later years, from
            professors. Occasionally this notion would crop up that boys
            were better at some mechanical and mathematical tasks, but
            such ideas were always hastily quelled by subsequent
            qualifications: that the evidence for male superiority was
            mostly anecdotal, that those differences didn't count for
            anything significant, and that the tests were biased, because
            really, when all is said and done, "girls are just as smart as
            boys".
            But the fact of the matter is, the NUMBERS do not bear that
            out within the realm of some of the key skills that are
            important to success in many STEM specialties. Nobody is
            trying to argue that IQ is the ONLY be-all, end-all predictor
            of success. Nobody is arguing that math and mechanical
            reasoning are the ONLY abilities that one must have to be
            successful in STEM fields. But at the same time, unless a
            candidate has a really good command of those things,
            particularly if that candidate intends to participate in
            higher levels of competition, whether for a top institutional
            award (such as in my case), a programmatic award (e.g.,
            Science Fair, which I'll talk about below), for grant money,
            or for tenure, the candidate MUST have a threshold-level of
            mastery of those things. That's a non-negotiable prerequisite
            for success.
            I always assumed that my personal experience was characterized
            by a healthy dose of subjectivism - that it perhaps was partly
            a case of boys being "smarter" than girls in the cognitive
            areas that posed the greatest challenges to me, but in large
            part, it must have actually been more a case of THOSE
            particular boys being "smarter" than THIS particular girl. But
            after what I read yesterday, I realized that I may have
            actually achieved a greater degree of objectivity than I
            initially gave myself credit for. I didn't realize that the
            sex differences in those specific abilities had been measured
            to be as great as they actually are, because a wide variety of
            people had consistently issued statements designed to obscure
            the fact of it.
            And I did NOT benefit from the obscuration that was
            shortsightedly intended to protect me, as a young female
            scientist, from the facts (presumably that obscuration was
            intended to protect me from becoming discouraged by the
            obvious ramifications of those facts). IN fact, I almost
            exited the scientific field prematurely purely because of that
            obscuration. For as long as I bought into the paradigm "girls
            are just as smart as boys", my life was miserable. I could
            achieve reasonably well in science, but I always felt like
            something was wrong, something was discordant, something was
            out of whack. And I was anxious and frustrated. That lack of
            confidence in women science students referenced in the
            interview above? I KNOW what that is. It's the uneasy feeling
            that one gets as a direct result of having smoke blown up
            one's a**. It's the uncomfortable twigging sensation that
            reflects the discrepancy between what the subconscious SENSES
            to be true, and what the conscious mind is being TOLD is true.
            I faced a do-or-die situation upon first entering university
            because I had to pay for it by going into massive personal
            debt. I concluded that if I couldn't make this science pathway
            work the way I sensed it SHOULD work for me, then I just had
            to get the heck out and find something different to invest my
            loans in. The worst part of that anxiety and lack of
            confidence was the simultaneous KNOWING that I was being held
            back somehow. Not by the institution, not by any individuals -
            THEY were all conspiring to push me FORWARD, whether I was
            enjoying the ride or not! I was being held back by PARADIGM,
            and the offending paradigm was "girls are just as smart as
            boys". This paradigm just wasn't reflective of reality; that
            became starkly apparent during my do-or-die examination of my
            situation. I realized that my only chance of being truly
            successful according to my potential for achievement in
            science was to scrap that, and adopt a new paradigm: "boys are
            smarter than girls in some ways, and girls are smarter than
            boys in some ways".
            Once I did that, it was like Enterprise shifting from impulse
            power to warp drive. The sky was the limit. The anxiety and
            the lack of confidence instantly disappeared - I was so much
            happier as a person as well as being a better-performing
            student! I was able to devote myself without imposed prejudice
            to finding genuinely-valid workarounds (rather than mere
            disguises) for those of my cognitive areas that were not as
            robust as they were in several of my male counterparts. And I
            was finally able to leverage those strengths that were not
            just personal strengths but which are really, at the heart of
            them, gender strengths.
            I am now seeing the very same experience replicated in my
            daughter (at that assertion, a shrewd scientist would
            interject the observation that consistency does not equal
            proof! :-) ). By any semi-objective evaluation, the kid is
            smart (when she was 10 years old, her OLSAT scores were above
            97th percentile, with nonverbal abilities being strongest).
            But I can look at her and look at her male peers and know
            instantly that it's a lost cause: if she tries to compete with
            them on THEIR terms (i.e., according to society's prevailing
            "smartness" paradigm), she will lose. It ain't happening.
            Restricted to such a headspace, she could do delightfully well
            in science-based academics, but she would never rise to
            fulfill her own potential unless she rejected much of the
            politically-correct rhetoric that she hears, and instead
            learns to think like a girl.
            And I've been trying to teach this to Alisonymous Junior for
            several years now: the skill of thinking like a girl, how to
            leverage those facets of intelligence where GIRLS are the ones
            with the measurable advantages, and bring those to bear on
            practical scientific challenges. Even after having attained
            new awarenesses about WHAT IT MEANS to think like a girl, I
            admit that I'm not immune to the influences of society's
            persistent paradigms to the contrary. If you live in manure,
            you're going to smell like manure despite your best efforts.
            So I have this meditative procedure in which I try to pep-talk
            myself away from that trap: "Vacate the paradigms. Don't slip
            back into that mode. Don't let everybody in the establishment,
            including other women, tell you how you're supposed to think.
            Think like a girl instead."
            I maintain that the proof of such teaching is in the pudding
            (although again, from any shrewd scientist, there would be
            raucous cries of "Confounds!"). Thus far, Alisonymous Junior
            is a four-time Clear Creek ISD Science Fair medalist, in very
            large part because of conscious intentional girl-thinking.
            CCISD is a large district (38,000 students) and its science
            programs are dominated by NASA families, which are among
            America's most academically-brilliant people. To achieve ANY
            competitive traction in that environment is noteworthy. Three
            of her four medals have been first place gold medals - the top
            prizes in those District-wide categories. And the fourth one
            was a project that went on to take a trophy at the Houston
            regional Science Fair. (And that success is NOT a result of me
            - I'm merely a coach, a minor role in the equation.
            Alisonymous Junior is just as headstrong as I was (am), is NOT
            inclined to allow anyone to lead her by the nose, least of all
            her tragically un-cool mother - horrors!, and certainly has
            the potential to be every bit as obnoxiously outspoken as I
            am. :-) )
            In sum, I will advise this much:
            Do you have a friend, niece, daughter, co-worker, or other
            young female in your life who you'd like to encourage with
            respect to an educational and career pathway in a STEM field?
            If the answer is yes, then do her a massive favor: sidestep
            the obscurations, patronizations, paradigms, politicizations,
            and "equalizations" that now cripple those educational and
            career pathways, and instead, help her learn how to think like
            a girl. That kind of thinking will serve her best, because
            that is what she was born to do.

            But before I get directly into that, I'd like to ask one more
            question of JohnD, and this is a bona fide question, not a
            defensive reaction on my part: at what point did we as a
            profession start blurring the boundary between observation and
            interpretation, and why did we start doing that?
            Aristotle, 350 BCE... 8-)
            Seriously, I think that the problem is that what you are
            calling "interpretation" others would call "understanding". If
            you want to understand an effect, it isn't enough to simply
            provide the descriptive statistics. You need to understand how
            those statistics arose, which then leads you into a fuller
            description of the effect (preferably as a mathematical
            function). Note that I do not suggest that you should let the
            description (be it statistical, mathematical, or schema)
            determine the results; what I do claim is that understanding
            the effect will tell you where to look for new information
            that isn't in your current data set. And that's what turns a
            good scientist into a great one - looking where no-one else
            has.
            When I see folks expounding upon why apparent IQ differences
            exist, a lot of what I detect seems like it is strongly
            interpretational rather than objectively explanatory.
            There is unfortunately a lot of that going on, mainly because
            it is such a poorly-posed problem that we don't know enough to
            ask the right questions and gather the right data sets yet.
            You (JohnD) seem very sure of your assertions, and you ain't
            dumb.
            That doesn't mean that I can't make an ass of myself, just
            like everyone else. Eric will attest to this, I am sure.
            You could jump right in and assert that it shows up like that
            because the tests are flawed, and you could note that IQ
            measurements are not a great success predictor, but if you do
            that, I think you're going to run the risk of overlooking the
            fruits of those come-to-Jesus data-embracing moments, the
            fruits that exist irrespective of any subsequent
            interpretations and explanations that you or others may apply.
            Philosophically, I tend to be a utilitarian. If there is a
            measurable difference in one parameter but it has no effect on
            the outcome, is it truly an important difference? That's why I
            pointed out that IQ is not a good predictor of success. Since
            IQ has little relationship to the outcome, why worry about it?
            Neisser et al., in their seminal 1996 compendium noted that
            there are "large differences favoring males" on visual-spatial
            tasks - the "mean of the male distribution is nearly one
            standard deviation above that for females" (One sigma?! That's
            *massive*!). They also noted that males demonstrate a
            "substantial advantage" on math SAT scores "with many more
            males scoring in the highest ranges" and that "males also
            score consistently higher on tests of proportional and
            mechanical reasoning".
            That is interesting. Has their work been replicated? (Remember
            [255]regression to the mean!) There have been [256]other
            studies that show a [257]much less dramatic relationship. And
            has there been a study showing that people who score higher on
            the math SAT do better as scientists? Have social factors such
            as [258]biases in pre-knowledge, [259]parental bias, rater
            bias, and [260]self bias been taken into account? Unless you
            can show that the two are related after all known biases are
            taken into account, then you run the risk of letting your
            personal bias drive the interpretation.
            But the fact of the matter is, the NUMBERS do not bear that
            out within the realm of some of the key skills that are
            important to success in many STEM specialties. Nobody is
            trying to argue that IQ is the ONLY be-all, end-all predictor
            of success. Nobody is arguing that math and mechanical
            reasoning are the ONLY abilities that one must have to be
            successful in STEM fields. But at the same time, unless a
            candidate has a really good command of those things,
            particularly if that candidate intends to participate in
            higher levels of competition, whether for a top institutional
            award (such as in my case), a programmatic award (e.g.,
            Science Fair, which I'll talk about below), for grant money,
            or for tenure, the candidate MUST have a threshold-level of
            mastery of those things. That's a non-negotiable prerequisite
            for success.
            You are arguing your conclusion. Unless you can show that the
            difference is inherent as opposed to being created by external
            factors, you have not shown that women cannot compete at the
            same level; you have merely shown that they have not done so
            as yet.
            Going back to my height example, if I claimed that the data
            showed that people in the 1980s were taller than those in the
            1930s, I'd be right. But if I claimed that it showed that
            people in the 1930s couldn't be as tall as those in the 1980s,
            I'd be flat wrong. That's because we understand that improved
            nutrition and improved medical care have allowed us to reach
            our potential, height-wise. Had a population from the 1930s
            been transplanted into 1980, they would have grown up just as
            tall as their neighbors. And that's what I meant by needing to
            understand where the difference come from in order to comment
            meaningfully.
            Now let's apply that to women in science. You are claiming
            that IQ tests tend to show that men do better than women in
            some key areas. But you haven't shown that the difference
            would persist even in the presence of equal social rewards and
            opportunities (indeed, in most of the work I've seen, when
            those factors are accounted for the difference vanishes). You
            have not taken those confounding factors into account. Until
            they have been, the data is interesting but not compelling.
            For as long as I bought into the paradigm "girls are just as
            smart as boys", my life was miserable.
            Can you show that women are inherently less intelligent than
            men? Your data thus far does not bear out that conclusion.
            Do you have a friend, niece, daughter, co-worker, or other
            young female in your life who you'd like to encourage with
            respect to an educational and career pathway in a STEM field?
            Yes, I do. I've taken her to several places where she can
            interact with other female scientists, and helped her blow
            stuff up. (Explosions are cool, no matter if you are a boy or
            a girl.) And I have encouraged her to be herself and not me
            nor anyone else.

            could always just go with the standard:

            The inclination toward utilitarianism is partly a gender
            influence upon the process of cognition.
            :-)
            Even before I read your latest comments, it had occurred to me
            that I might have more success in making my points if I simply
            engaged the debate from a more mechanistic perspective.
            "Why worry about it?" Follow the money. Because IQ measures
            are correlated with test scores, and test scores translate
            into GPA outcomes, which determine the entire gamut of
            academic access from admissions to scholarships (scholarships
            were huge for me because I was funded by loans).
            And let's not bulls*** ourselves: we are NOT talking about
            Fun, Fair, Positive Soccer here. We're talking about cutthroat
            academic environments. That male who outscored me on his
            quantitative SAT is going to be the exact same male who is
            sitting beside me in geophysics class. And if I don't identify
            my own unique way to play conceptual tortoise to his
            mechanical hare, I'm *FINISHED*, because he's going to mop the
            hallowed institutional floor with me, performance-wise, just
            as he did on the SAT. I don't give a rat's bottom WHY his
            quantitative scores are higher, HOW they got to be that way,
            whether they SHOULD be that way or are distorted by inaccurate
            measurement, or what it all means for my relative long-term
            life success. In that scenario, I do not have the luxury of
            entertaining such questions. All I know is that I face a
            discrete practical issue that requires an immediate solution:
            how to get a better grade than him through the application of
            authentic effort.
            And of course, the scenarios I've described, both mine and my
            daughter's, are end-member competitive extremities. But a
            measure of the same headspace applies to everyone who enrolls
            in post-secondary education. We're in competition for a
            well-defined collection of short-term rewards, which are not
            all equivalent. When you're engrossed in that space, it
            doesn't matter to you what your long-term career ramifications
            are. It matters where you fall on the curve for that course
            that required a few thousand dollars for you to participate
            in.
            I had further realizations about the whole girl-think issue
            after what I wrote yesterday. I've been operating from these
            principles for years, but no situation has called upon me to
            articulate them before now. I can add the following:
            (1) The attempt to excise gender from evaluation of
            STEM-related aptitudes is, on its most fundamental level, an
            attempt to excise gender, period, which is actually an attempt
            to excise identity, which makes absolutely no existential
            sense. If we accept the paradigm "girls are just as smart as
            boys", really what we're saying is that Alisonymous is a
            person first, a scientist second, and a girl third. Well, I
            have a huge problem with that, because that's not the way I
            perceive myself. I see myself as a person first, a girl
            second, and a scientist third. Why on earth would I discard or
            even minimize the gender component of my identity?! It's
            fundamental to who I am, and is one of my greatest sources of
            strength, intellectually and otherwise.
            So there's that, a nasty little byproduct of the prevailing
            "equal cannot mean equal-but-different" decree.
            But here's something more profound: it was only this morning
            that I realized WHY society is so resistant to the alternate
            paradigm "boys are smarter in some ways, and girls are smarter
            in some ways". It's because where STEM is concerned, the
            relative intellectual advantages of girls are not seen as
            being consequential. There's almost a sense that those
            strengths constitute nothing more than a genetic consolation
            prize of sorts. Paraphrasing the attitudes I've always sensed:
            "Verbal?! Well, heh heh, verbal superiority is all very well
            and good, how nice for you, but verbal doesn't make the world
            go 'round. And memory? Mmmm, that's a fun thing, too, but it
            won't build bridges or rockets or cure cancer."
            Wrong answers. `Verbal' happens to reflect the mechanism that
            underlies the definition and organization of the very products
            of cognition. And memory is the feature that makes those
            cognitive products available for organization and
            manipulation. And the Holy Grail derivative of both: the
            process of association, which often manifests in everyday life
            as "noticing things". Wives notice all these little things of
            the type that drive their husbands absolutely batty because
            the husbands don't think that those things warrant attention;
            they often classify them as "mental clutter". Even more
            tedious to men: "womens' intuition". I have a hunch that
            women, if properly allowed to BE women, would have tremendous
            incremental capacity to "notice things" and to further develop
            their capacities to intuit associations in STEM-related
            fields. But instead, they are largely forced into these little
            "you-are-the-same-as-men" paradigm boxes that are so
            uncomfortable and which, if accepted wholeheartedly, just
            might doom them to dissatisfaction and reduced performance in
            STEM careers (if they even stick with those careers).
            I have successfully leveraged that incremental capacity for
            associative insight with my daughter. Every time she kicks off
            a new science project, I start with (paraphrasing), "OK, our
            first task is to figure out WHAT IT IS in the way of an
            important perspective that is right under our noses, that
            every other person in this city of six million people has
            utterly overlooked. THAT is where we need to start with our
            focus, because THAT is one of the things we do best as girls."
            Translation: form associations that nobody else has been able
            to form yet, perhaps because they simply did not notice a
            basis for association, or perhaps because they either ouvertly
            or subconsciously concluded that the associations were too
            trivial to bother with, an error people tend to make when they
            are unable transcend mechanical perspectives to see just how
            importantly those things actually integrate into the big
            picture of the world's workings. Does that sound familiar? It
            should. It's one of the processes by which science advances.

       Great interview, Eric! I know the science community is gradually
       becoming aware that getting women involved in STEM (especially
       engineering) is an important challenge to overcome. As Nancy
       Hopkins observed, there are many barriers that most people don't

       willing to accept genetic predisposition in so many other aspects
       of biology and personality; why can't we accept gender-based
       differences as well?

            I argue that there's NOTHING wrong with what Summers said,
            within the CONTEXT in which he clearly intended to say it
            (which is not the same as the context in which the mainstream
            news media and others have presented it). See the thread
            between JohnD and myself.

       An excellent interview. She raises quite a few good points without
       trying to push any specific "solution" (other than time). Having
       worked with several female scientists, I have to say that in my
       experience they work harder and have a deeper understanding of the
       subject than most male scientists do.

       The worst thing about an article like this is the vague meaning of
       the term "science"
       Science could mean any of hundreds of career paths from nursing to
       NASA.
       This article is just someone talking off the top of their head and
       offering no hard and detailed facts.

       [270]March 25, 2012 at 2:23 pm
       "So it really was civil rights and affirmative action in the late
       1960s and early 1970s that opened the doors of universities in the
       United States so women could get in. Then the women's movement,
       Sputnik, and many things happened that pushed more women into
       science."
       Sputnik was later than the late 1960's?

            [271]March 25, 2012 at 6:39 pm
            True enough Mr. McDermott, I glossed over that horribly
            mangled timeline. Maybe she was tired and forgot what came
            first and when.

            Wrong Dan. Sputnik went up in 1957. I remember walking down a
            high school hallway after school one day right after the
            launch was made public. There happened to be one of the
            school's brightest science students with me in that hallway. I
            recalling him saying that this event was worrysome and would
            have far reaching consequences. He got that right.
          + JohnD says:
            [273]March 26, 2012 at 8:53 am
            craig, I think Dan is right. 1957 is not "the late 60's"; it
            isn't even the early 60s. As Dr. J points out, she probably
            was speaking ex tempore and just got the sequence of events a
            little garbled.
   12. [274]noki says:
       [275]March 25, 2012 at 4:55 pm
       Thanks for this interview. There are still many quietly closed
       doors and unspoken, yet readily imposed, limits.
   13. craig says:
       [276]March 25, 2012 at 9:32 pm
       If the Severely Conservatives gain control of all 3 branches of
       government they will not only want to roll back this advance for
       women but take away their right to vote as well. Progress is an
       anathema for them. Their belief is if it wasn't done before that's
       good enough for them...they will never do it. Change is something
       they can't believe in.

            Buddy, don't you get tired of playing that old, rusty saw?
            No on thinks it true, not even you. Why bother, except to
            troll?

            Change, per se, is ubiquitous in human affairs. I don't
            "believe" in change any more than I "believe" in the Gulf of
            Mexico!

       A new married wombat avoids a good lack of knowledge. This textbook
       rages under the mummy. FarmVille cheats ignores the trade inside of
       an september. FarmVille cheats will lose whichever mentor driving
       the actual shield. Ones resemblance delivers a received academics.
