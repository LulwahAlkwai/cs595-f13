   Summary:

   The detention of a journalist's partner and seizure of his electronics,
   combined with the British government's threats towards the Guardian for
   its reporting, make the case that we need something like WikiLeaks more
   than ever.

   If it wasn't already obvious that the U.S. government is targeting
   journalists as part of its ongoing war on leaks, it should be fairly
   clear now that Guardian writer Glenn Greenwald's partner has been
   [38]detained for nine hours in a British airport and had all of his
   electronics seized by authorities looking for classified documents like
   the ones Greenwald got from former CIA contractor Edward Snowden. More
   than anything, this kind of behavior highlights the value of having a
   stateless, independent media entity such as WikiLeaks.

   And if that wasn't enough, Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger has written
   about [39]an almost unprecedented effort by British authorities to
   force the newspaper to stop reporting on the government's surveillance
   of its citizens -- including the seizure and destruction of hard drives
   at the newspaper's offices and warnings about future action if the
   reporting continues. Rusbridger said the paper will continue its work,
   but will do so from the U.S. As [40]he described it:

     "And so one of the more bizarre moments in the Guardian's long
     history occurred - with two GCHQ security experts overseeing the
     destruction of hard drives in the Guardian's basement just to make
     sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could
     possibly be of any interest."

A pattern of journalistic harassment

   [41]Reporter

   Moving to the U.S. may not be much of an alternative, however, given
   the American government's recent behavior. U.S. authorities have said
   that Britain took the action they did against Greenwald's partner,
   Brazilian resident David Miranda, without any direction from the Obama
   administration -- under Britain's Schedule 7 anti-terrorism law --
   although the U.S. government [42]did acknowledge that British
   authorities gave them a "head's up" about the detention and search. But
   should we believe this, knowing that senior security officials have
   routinely lied about their activities?

   Given what has happened with Snowden, it's entirely believable that the
   Obama administration asked Britain to take such action, or at least
   suggested that it would be grateful if it occurred. What's especially
   depressing is how quick some defenders of the U.S. security apparatus
   [43]were to argue that it was Greenwald's own fault his partner was
   treated in such a way -- as though targeting the families of
   journalists for unreasonable search and seizure should be considered
   routine:

     A reminder: if you don't want your spouse questioned about your
     reporting, don't use him as a document mule
     [44]joshuafoust.com/the-miranda-de...--
       (@joshuafoust) [45]August 19, 2013

   As the Free Press and others have pointed out, the detention is just
   part of [46]a much larger pattern of harassment that has been directed
   at journalists by the U.S. government over the last year -- a pattern
   that includes veiled [47]threats of prosecution against Greenwald and
   other journalists who have been involved in leaks, as well as the
   ongoing quasi-legal measures it has been taking against WikiLeaks
   founder Julian Assange.

WikiLeaks is already a media entity

   While the idea of WikiLeaks as a media entity is not universally
   accepted, I and others have argued that it [48]deserves to be thought
   of in that way: journalism professor Jay Rosen has called it the "first
   stateless news organization," and Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler
   has made a persuasive case -- both in his writings and in testimony at
   the Bradley Manning trial -- that WikiLeaks [49]is a crucial part of
   what he calls "the networked Fourth Estate."

     The Guardian hard drive shredding scandal demonstrates why it is
     necessary to publish early publish often and publish globally.--
     WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) [50]August 20, 2013

   Even Bill Keller, the former New York Times executive editor who has
   had a somewhat contentious relationship with both Assange and
   WikiLeaks, has told me that he believes the WikiLeaks founder
   [51]should be given the same protections as any journalist, and that
   the attacks on the organization are a serious threat to freedom of the
   press.

     "I would regard an attempt to criminalize WikiLeaks' publication of
     these documents as an attack on all of us, and I believe the
     mainstream media should come to his defense. You don't have to
     embrace Julian Assange as a kindred spirit to believe that what he
     did in publishing those cables falls under the protection of the
     First Amendment."

   Although WikiLeaks is arguably a media entity in its own right, it also
   benefits from forming partnerships with existing media players -- as it
   has in the past with The Guardian, the New York Times and others --
   just as Edward Snowden saw it as [52]valuable to reach out to Greenwald
   instead of just publishing the NSA documents he had on some random
   website. Traditional media outlets and journalists not only have a
   brand value and an existing audience, but they can help put things in
   context and make their meaning more obvious.

We need Anonymous for journalism

   [53]Anonymous

   As the U.S. government and others not only put more pressure on the
   original whistleblowers in such cases -- the Bradley Mannings and the
   Edward Snowdens -- but also [54]continue to ratchet up the pressure on
   the journalists who assist them, it becomes even more important to have
   some kind of entity like WikiLeaks that can act as a central outlet for
   such leaks, a place that is theoretically out of reach of U.S. control
   (if such a thing is even possible).

   Even if WikiLeaks isn't the best candidate for this kind of entity,
   either because of Assange's personal behavior or his management style
   -- or both -- there arguably needs to be something similar. Perhaps a
   group [55]like the hacker collective Anonymous -- a diffused and
   leaderless movement that shares a common goal -- but for journalistic
   documents might work. Or a combination of Anonymous and the
   file-sharing outlet Pirate Bay, where leakers can send their
   information and know that it will not fall into the wrong hands. Media
   outlets have tried to create such entities [56]but mostly failed.

   Having that kind of stateless, leaderless entity might make it harder
   for governments to make any headway by attacking individual journalists
   like Greenwald or even individual leakers. In some ways, it's
   unfortunate that such a thing needs to exist at all, but even if we
   look only at what has happened over the past year, that case has
   arguably been made. Now all that is required is the motivation and the
   means to create it.

       While not an "Anonymous for journalism" as you describe, today we
       launched a campaign calling on the US and UK to halt the attacks on
       and intimidation of national security journalists.
       Our goal is to build a rapid response network of activists to
       support and defend journalists who are on the front lines of
       critical accountability reporting and who are facing the kinds of
       threats we see in the US, UK and around the globe.
       Here is a blog post on the new campaign:

       What I find interesting - and something I haven't seen explained -
       is that Miranda was recognized for whom his partner is, and held.
       So the Brits have a watch list for family members of journalists?
       If you write an exposé on the government, does your grandmother or
       your 5-year old nephew have to fear arrest or detention?

            It's a perverse inversion of a practice typical of the Soviet
            Union and its eastern European satellites. Citizens of those
            countries who were permitted to travel abroad knew that if
            they "misbehaved" (i.e., defected), it would be taken out on
            family members who were kept as hostages back in the
            Fatherland. As of today, residents of, for example, Brazil
            know that if they "misbehave" (i.e., report on the burgeoning
            Anglo-American surveillance state), it will be taken out on
            family members who travel abroad. Yakov Smirnoff used to tell
            bad jokes about this kind of thing, but now the joke's on us.

                 Hah! I had just been entertaining a notion of Yakov
                 Smirnoff saying about the USA rather than Soviet Russia:

            It seems to me that everyone linked to the journalist is now
            at risk of being searched and accused as well. It doesn't take
            much more to make this a true fascist state.

       while wikileaks sit on information that could cause real change
       they are as bad as those who they claim to be fighting, thus they
       are part of the problem that people must stand up and fight and
       demand that like the governments who keep secrets from society that
       wikileaks also release the secrets they keep. do not support
       wikileaks until they stop hiding the truth from the people just
       like the governments and corporations that rape our society are
       doing so are wikileaks by keeping such from soceity.

            You are correct about the Obama administration's war on leaks.
            But while I know you were being humorous, references to Stalin
            only serve to distract. Reminds me of Tea Party activists
            referring to Obama as Hitler. I don't think you want to go
            there?
