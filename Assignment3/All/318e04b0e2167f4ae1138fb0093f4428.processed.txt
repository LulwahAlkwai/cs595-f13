New findings reveal animal obesity epidemic
       Loading...
       24 November 2010

It is well known that human obesity is on the increase.  Various factors are
often blamed for this, such as lack of exercise, the popularity of junk food
or poor lifestyle choices.  However, startling [10]new research published in
[11]Proceedings of the Royal Society B suggests that attributing obesity
solely to these specifically human factors may be wide of the mark.
       Researchers based in the U.S. used information collected on the
       weight of more than 24,000 fully-grown individual animals from
       numerous scientific studies across the world.  Their study included
       animals that live with humans in a variety of settings - including
       pet cats and dogs, captive chimpanzees, feral rats and laboratory
       mice.  Despite the range of species studied and the circumstances
       in which they live, every single species studied experienced an
       increase in their average weight over time.
       While this might be attributed to pampered pets or feral rats
       living off discarded junk food, the fact that even laboratory
       animals - who tend to live on strictly controlled diets - are
       getting fatter suggests that some hitherto-unconsidered common
       factor may be leading to increased obesity in all of the animals
       studied, including humans.
       As Yann Klimentidis, one of the study's authors, states: "When
       looking for ways to combat obesity in humans, we need to be more
       aware of all the possible alternative causes of obesity.  If we can
       find causes for the weight gain seen in our animal subjects, we may
       be better able to apply that to coping with obesity in humans."
