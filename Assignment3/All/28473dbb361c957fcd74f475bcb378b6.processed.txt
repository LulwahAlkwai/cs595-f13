Nate Silver Skeptical of Big Data Trends, Keys in on Culture

   [73]Nate Silver, Big Data, Tableau Customer Conference There were two
   big takeaways I had from Nate Silver's time on #theCUBE during this
   week's Tableau Customer Conference: 1) the editor
   of [74]ESPN`s FiveThirtyEight is more of a skeptic, taking a
   wait-and-see approach to Big Data, and 2) culture is more important
   when analyzing data than most realize. I was fascinated to hear Silver
   talk about culture being key for good data analysis, and was equally
   intrigued to learn that he isn't as bullish on [75]Big Data trends as
   most in his field tend to be.

   In Silver's keynote, he spoke on how the volume of data does not trump
   the modeling of data. It is not your typical "more the merrier"
   situation -- good data analysis requires both. The interesting part to
   that equation is that there is a third factor: volume + modeling +
   culture = good data analysis. "You need volume of data, you need high
   quality data, you need a culture that actually has the right incentives
   aligned, where you really do want to find a way to build a better
   product to make more money," said Silver. And that is where my interest
   was thoroughly piqued.

   Silver alludes to the concept that large organizations have people
   within the company that are thinking much more short-term than the C
   level executives. Furthermore, different departments in the company
   might be thinking about their P&L only, as that is what measures their
   level of success.

     "A lot of success in business, and certainly when it comes to the
     use of analytics, is just stripping away the things that get in the
     way from understanding and distract you. Its not some wave a magic
     wand and have some formula where you uncover all the secrets of the
     world. Its more like, if you can strip away the noise than you're
     going to have a much clearer understanding of what's really there."

Maintaining healthy skepticism

   Being known as a Big Data guy (whatever that means), you might be
   shocked to learn that Silver takes issue with some of the core notions
   of Big Data too. Specifically, the importance of causation vs.
   correlation. Another recent guest of #theCUBE with a strong opinion on
   causality was Kenneth Neil Cukier from the Economist. In his book Big
   Data - A Revolution That Will Transform How We Will Work & Think, he
   states that causality really doesn't matter anymore. In summary, if you
   know that your customers are going to buy more products by analyzing a
   data set or correlation, then the "why" doesn't matter -- you should
   try to exploit that.

   Watch the interview with Silver in its entirety below.  More on
   Silver's segment after the clip:

 Causality matters

   Silver disagrees firmly with the notion that causality doesn't matter.
   He recommends hypothesis testing.  Coming in with some questions and
   looking for that causality are very important to data analysis and
   predicting. This is where his bearishness on Big Data and the current
   trends being predicted shows its teeth.

     "If it's true that merely finding a lot of correlations and very
     high-volume data sets will improve productivity, then how come we've
     had such slow economic growth over the last ten years? Where is the
     tangible increase in patent growth, or different measures of
     progress?"

   Silver is suspicious of people saying that one technology is a
   game-changer relative to our entire economic history. [77]Big Data is
   no free ticket to success. Looking at Big Data and the Internet of
   Things together, I now have calmer approach to my technology
   prophecies. The understanding and humanizing of data is going to change
   our world for the better...but I'm not sure we're even close to
   realizing what that means yet.
