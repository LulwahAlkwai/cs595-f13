   MAKE magazine is bringing its popular Hardware Innovation Workshop to
   New York for a one-day event at the New York Hall of Science. Don't
   miss this unprecedented opportunity to network with fellow maker pros
   as you learn tips and hints, best practices and avenues to successfully
   navigate the transition to maker pro.

   A leader of the maker movement, MAKE has been integral in helping DIY
   hobbyists avail themselves of the tools and technologies--such as 3D
   printers, CNC mills, and microcontrollers--to design and engineer
   innovative products and devices. Increasingly, these projects provide
   real solutions that enhance consumers' lifestyles. As a result, many of
   these maker pros find themselves running startup companies with little
   experience or knowledge of the business ecosystem. Facing the
   challenges of every business, they seek out experts and others who have
   been there, to advise them on manufacturing, distribution, pricing,
   funding, customer acquisition and marketing,

   With the launch of its Hardware Innovation Workshop, MAKE has provided
   a forum for conversation to help makers connect with makers, and makers
   connect with pros in an intimate, collaborative environment.

   This one-day event at NYSCI will take the best of the content, ideas,
   views and visions from the Bay Area event, and consolidate it into the
   ultimate "toolbox for maker pros."

   Topics and sessions will include:
     * Digital manufacturing: Getting to Scale
     * Prototyping and Fabrication
     * Partnering to Get it Made
     * Wisdom of the Crowd: Crowdsourcing
     * Getting Started: Maker Pro Case Studies
     * Manufacturing & The New World Order
     * Maker-to-Market: Incubators & Accelerators

   Pitch your Prototype

   Plus, in the final session, entrepreneurs (who have submitted their
   concepts and have been selected as finalists) present their prototypes
   to the audience of their peers and experts, to convince them their
   ideas have merit and commercial viability. At the evening event, they
   will have the opportunity to display their projects and explain their
   business strategy to the assembled crowd. The finalists have been
   determined! They are: CopyCat, Firefly Newborn Phototherapy, Grow
   Cubes, Keen Vent, and Quench Equitable Smart Water Dispenser.  Complete
   contest rules: [48]Pitches With Prototypes Contest Rules-1

   Co-hosts Dale Dougherty, Travis Good and Haytham Elhawary join leaders
   at the forefront of the maker movement--early pioneers who paved the
   road for others to benefit from their experience, both successes and
   pitfalls.
