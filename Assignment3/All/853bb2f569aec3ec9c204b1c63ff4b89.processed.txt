How to Clean Your Laptop

    1. Macbook-pro-plug

1. Power Down and Unplug
       First you'll need to turn your laptop off completely, and unplug
       the charging cord as well as any other USB cords you may have.
       You'll also want to remove your laptop's battery to reduce the risk
       of shock or damage.

    2. Computer-keyboard

2. Keyboard
       Use a can of compressed air to remove dust and debris from the
       keyboard. Don't hold the can upside down; simply tilt and spray.
       Then, use a soft brush attachment on a vacuum hose to clean out any
       remaining bits of debris or dust.

    3. 2979439003_42d9d30aff_o

3. Outer Casing and Keyboard Keys
       If your computer still looks a little grimy, you can use cotton
       swabs and rubbing alcohol on and in between the keys of the
       keyboard. Just make sure the swabs are damp and not wet.
       Use cleansing wipes to wipe down the outer casing.

    4. 4882227235_1e03ab77ea_o

4. Screen
       You can use a homemade solution of equal parts white vinegar and
       distilled water for your LCD screen. Do not spray the solution
       directly onto the screen, but instead spray on a soft rag and then
       gently wipe the screen.

5. Fan
       Turn your laptop over and look for an air vent on the outer edge of
       the laptop, covered by an access panel. If you unscrew this panel,
       you should see the fan. If not, you will either need to search
       elsewhere (perhaps there's another panel) or your fan may not be
       readily accessible. You'll have to take your laptop to a specialist
       who can access the fan for you.
       Use compressed air once again to blow out the dust. You may want to
       do this outside, since it can be a little messy. Keep your bursts
       short and gentle; anything stronger could damage the fan or other
       internal components of your laptop.

    6. 2990809348_95a950e7a5_o

6. Ports
       Wipe out the inside of each port with a dry cotton swab (without
       rubbing alcohol this time) and then spray each with your can of
       compressed air. Remember, be gentle.

    7. 4942205662_32877496f5_o

7. Put It Back Together
       All clean? Screw the panel back in and replace your battery, and
       you're good to go. Bet that laptop runs a lot cooler and quieter
       now, doesn't it?
       Remember to clean your laptop every couple of months to keep it
       working smoothly.

   We're not trying to sound like your mom here, but seriously, when was
   the last time you cleaned your laptop? If you can't remember -- or
   never have -- then read this article and get to work, because you're
   long overdue.

   Even just sitting on your desk, your laptop can get dirty. Dust
   accumulates and clogs the internal components of your laptop,
   especially in the fan. This forces the fan to run more often, which can
   lead to overheating. Allowing a laptop to overheat is one of the best
   ways to kill it, short of a sledgehammer. Since we love our tech, we
   want to ensure that yours lives a long and healthy life.

   We're going to give you step-by-step guide on how to clean that beloved
   laptop of yours, so you can give it the TLC it desperately needs.

   Instructions will, of course, vary depending on laptop brand. Dig out
   your user's manual for more detailed instructions on how to reach
   certain parts of your laptop. If you really don't feel comfortable
   getting to know the inner workings of your device, take it to a
   specialist.
