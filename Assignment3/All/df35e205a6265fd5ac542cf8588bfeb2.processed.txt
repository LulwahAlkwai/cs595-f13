   Summary:

   The next generation of Windows 8.1 tablets with Intel's new Atom chip
   may end Windows RT and Surface RT. Here's a rundown of some upcoming
   devices that start at $299 for a full Windows 8.1 experience with 10+
   hours of run time.
   Transformer Book T100 Back

   New devices with the latest chips and updated Windows 8.1 software are
   coming this holiday season and they just might be the final nail in the
   coffin of Windows RT. The timing is terrible for Microsoft, which is
   [37]holding an event later this month to reportedly introduce Surface
   2, a follow-up to the Surface RT tablet that [38]cost the company $900
   million in an inventory write-off.

   Noted Windows watcher Paul Thurrott has [39]details on the lineup of
   upcoming Windows tablets and laptops. All of them are expected to
   compete well with Windows RT devices in terms of battery life and
   performance and some start at under $300. A key difference? All of the
   Windows 8.1 devices can run any nearly Windows software title. Windows
   RT devices such as Surface RT and Surface 2 are limited to apps
   rewritten for the touch-friendly Metro user interface.

   Here are some of the product details Thurrott shared on Thursday:

   [40]Dell Venue

   Dell's Venue, an 8-inch Windows 8.1 tablet powered by next-gen Intel
   Atom with 1280 x 800 touchscreen and stylus. A 10 hour battery life and
   expected cost of $299.

   [41]Transformer T100 Book

   The Asus Tranformer Book T100 -- [42]which we noted earlier this
   morning -- a 10.1-inch Windows 8.1 tablet with docking keyboard, Intel
   Atom chip, 1366 x 768 display, USB 3.0 port and 11 hour battery life.
   The 32 GB model will cost $349 while a 64 GB version will add $50 to
   the price.

   [43]Dell Midland

   An unnamed Dell product with the codename of "midland". Thurrott says
   this is a 10.8-inch Windows 8.1 tablet with 1920 x 1080 resolution;
   rare for an Intel Atom powered-device. The $399 includes a pen and
   there will be integrated LTE options as well as a desktop dock and
   travel keyboard offered. Battery life is expected to be 9 hours with
   the travel keyboard adding another 10 hours of runtime.

   Thurrott also notes some upcoming Lenovo and Acer devices in the mix,
   but you get the idea. How can a Surface 2 or other Windows RT device
   compete with these?

   Simply put, they can't unless Microsoft were to sell its hardware at
   below cost to reduce prices to $249 or less. As it is, [44]last year's
   Surface RT launched at $499 without a keyboard and I can't see
   Microsoft getting the price of Surface 2 down to $349 at launch, let
   alone get it even lower. And don't expect Nokia to be a huge help here
   if Thurrott's information on [45]the company's Windows RT tablet is
   correct: He says Nokia will price its tablet at $499.

   I had high hopes when Windows for ARM was announced but those hopes
   were [46]initially dashed when PC makers aggressively moved into the
   low-end Windows 8 market using Intel's Atom chip. Now that Atom is
   getting a performance and battery life boost, combined with legacy
   Windows app support, there's just no reason for Windows RT to exist. At
   least not at the current device prices.

       I'd have to disagree. RT is Microsofts first big step to making
       Windows available on all SoCs, both ARM and x86, thus further
       converging computing. They want to be enable developers to write
       programs that will run across platforms, from the phone to the
       desktop, without worrying about compatibility. I see it competing
       with Chrome OS heavily this holiday season, and yes, at a more
       affordable Chrome OS price of sub-300 dollars.

       Why would I want to run desktop Apps on an 8 inch Tablet? Why the
       need of full Windows 8 with an Intel processor that's not going to
       get me the battery life of ARM? That's why I prefer Windwos RT on
       smaller devices than Windows 8. Kevin, you don't get it.

            John, I used Windows on 7-inch tablets via the 3 UMPCs I
            bought a half-dozen years ago. So I get your point, but these
            devices have much higher resolution on them than my old UMPCs
            where full desktop apps stunk. DPI scaling helps now too.
            I also see you overlooked a key point: the Intel Atom devices
            get the same (or better) battery life as their ARM
            counterparts.

            Maybe you have no need to run desktop apps on your tablet.
            However, some features aren't included in Windows R such as:
            Windows Media Player
            Windows Media Center
            The ability to connect to your Windows RT PC from another PC
            using Remote Desktop
            With Windows RT, you can install apps directly from the
            Windows Store. You can only install printers, mice, keyboards,
            and other devices that have the Designed for Windows RT logo
            I can't see the advantage of Win RT if the device costs the
            same. You can always use a Win 8 device like a WIn RT device
            but the converse is not true.

                 If the devices are running Windows 8 instead of Windows 8
                 Pro, you will not be able to connect to he device using
                 Remote Desktop. With the prices I'm seeing for the
                 devices, they are running Windows 8 not Windows Pro. Dell
                 Venue - $299. Lenovo Miix 8 $249.
                 Here is a link comparing the versions of Windows (Windows
                 RT, Windows 8 and Windows Pro).

                 I agree. I've had my W510 for a few months now, and
                 although I mainly use it as I would an RT tablet (IE, and
                 metro apps), I do appreciate being able to run my desktop
                 software as well (iTunes, VLC, Chrome, Open Office), and
                 installing drivers and software for my wireless MFP. All
                 that flexibility, without having to sacrifice battery
                 life is why RT would not make sense to me as a user.
                 I personally can't wait for the smaller 8 inch Bay Trail
                 based tablets - especially if they are priced as
                 competitively as noted in Kevin's article.

            Actually John...he does.
            Why are smart phones now topping out non-smart phones when the
            latter typically gets better battery life. It is the apps! RT
            simply doesn't have them while the full version of Windows
            does!

       Let me play the devil's advocate here, Kevin, since again you
       mention being able to run legacy software as an "advantage":
       Do legacy apps benefit from a touch UI, and of so, do they run well
       on slate hardware?
       The answer to both those questions is a big no, and I can give
       concrete examples. It's impossible to resize spreadsheet cells
       using your finger to swipe on the display. Yes, I can run audio
       software, but without proper hardware drivers, I am handicapped.
       Likewise, there's little reason to run full screen 3D titles when
       the software keyboard refuses to work.
       The truth is being able to run x86 software on tablets is a novelty
       feature, and a novelty simply because the platform is not
       pretending to be either a notebook or a desktop, it is a slate.

            Fair point although most of these slates come with a keyboard
            and trackpad.
            Here's the question though. If legacy support is a novelty,
            why are PC makers putting their efforts behind full Windows
            tablets instead of RT?

                 As long as we are having a discussion about desktop apps
                 on tablets, Windows has failed as a mobile operating
                 system.

                      Not really, because why only use it as a handheld
                      tablet? Why not connect a monitor and kb/mouse if
                      you want to type or browse on a larger screen?
