Limitations of a Software-Only Approach to Data Center Networking

   Padmasree Warrior
   [63]Padmasree Warrior | August 29, 2013 at 8:04 am PST
   ([64]9 Comments)

   I want to address some questions about VMware's NSX virtual networking
   announcement that have been asked of us by the media and social Web
   commentators in the past few days. Specifically, they have asked  why
   Cisco did not announce support for NSX and whether the announcement
   changes the long-standing strategic relationship between our two
   companies.

   First, let me be clear: VMware is an important partner to Cisco, and we
   expect to continue our close collaboration around private [65]cloud and
   desktop virtualization.  As we outlined yesterday in a [66]joint news
   release about Cisco and VMware's mutual customers, thousands of
   organizations rely on our combined innovation in their businesses each
   and every day and I look forward to continued success in this area.

   While we share a common vision for private [67]cloud and desktop
   virtualization, there are significant differences in our visions over
   the future of networking.

   Network virtualization is important. We both agree on that. In fact,
   over the past several years, we have delivered game-changing
   innovations in this area particularly with the Nexus 1000v and more
   recently with NFV solutions, both of which are key elements of the
   [68]Cisco ONE portfolio. Today, more than 6,000 Nexus 1000v customers
   benefit from the flexibility delivered by our virtual networking
   technology.

   However, a software-only approach to network virtualization places
   significant constraints on customers.  It doesn't scale, and it fails
   to provide full real-time visibility of both physical and virtual
   infrastructure.  In addition this approach does not provide key
   capabilities such as multi-hypervisor support, integrated security,
   systems point-of-view or end-to-end telemetry for application placement
   and troubleshooting.  This loosely-coupled approach forces the user to
   tie multiple 3^rd party components together adding cost and complexity
   in day-to-day operations as well as throughout the network lifecycle.
   Users are forced to address multiple management points and maintain
   version control for each of the independent components.  Software
   network virtualization treats physical and virtual infrastructure as
   separate entities, and denies customers a common policy framework and
   common operational model for management, orchestration and monitoring.

   Cisco has a different strategy and that is embodied in the Application
   Centric Infrastructure.  Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) is an
   innovative secure architecture that delivers centralized
   application-driven policy automation, management and visibility of
   physical and virtual networks.  It's built upon a fabric foundation
   that delivers best-in-class infrastructure by combining hardware,
   software and ASIC innovations into an integrated system.

   The architecture provides a common management framework for network,
   application, security and virtualization teams -- making IT more agile
   while reducing application deployment time.  It's built for
   multi-tenancy ensuring proper isolation and detailed telemetry of SLAs
   across different consumers of the infrastructure while also providing a
   consistent security policy across both physical and virtual
   applications.  ACI allows IT teams to offer a public cloud experience
   and economics to their customers while maintaining the associated SLAs
   and performance requirements for the most demanding business
   applications.  It's an open programmable architecture with a
   comprehensive set of APIs that enables the broadest ecosystem of
   datacenter management and L4-7 services.  Finally, ACI enables
   comprehensive investment protection by leveraging existing IT teams'
   skillset and infrastructure to lower overall TCO.

   I recently wrote a blog post about how [69]Network Virtualization is a
   Different to Server Virtualization as we think about the next chapter
   of networking.  It's key to remember that underutilized compute
   resources created the opportunity for server virtualization.
   Underutilization is not a problem in the network. In fact, server
   virtualization is pushing the limits of today's network utilization and
   driving demand for higher port counts, application and policy-driven
   automation, and unified management of physical, virtual and cloud
   infrastructures in a single system.  Businesses today are looking for
   more from their investments as they turn on new services and
   applications more quickly, in a way that is easier to manage and that
   can scale with applications needs.

   We believe that delivering those benefits requires the flexibility of
   software coupled tightly with the performance and scalability of
   hardware and ASICs. That's what we're delivering with our
   [70]Application-Centric Infrastructure vision and throughout the entire
   Unified Data Center portfolio.

   Stay tuned for some exciting news from us in this area in the next few
   months.

   Dear Ms. Warrior

   Thanks a lot! Great wrap up and makes loads of sense. Being a network
   engineer, what I fundamentally never understood is how on earth would a
   software-only approach work in the first place?! Your typically lucid
   commentary addresses the same. Application centric Infrastructure
   indeed makes sense from a point of view of scalability and as an answer
   to "what is required as infrastructure to support my apps and
   scalability?"

   As virtualization keeps evolving in different flavours, questions about
   Application Centric management of Cloud services are also being asked,
   especially as related to managing complex applications and workloads in
   the clouds which require automation of timely infrastructure
   reconfiguration. Do you envisage Cisco's vision of ACI to also include
   addressing of similar scenarios please?

   Thank you!

   Best Regards

   "what is required as infrastructure to support my apps and
   scalability?"-It is a great ACI question. Hope Ms. Warrior an help.

   Another great question would be: How RJ's 10G-HDPP-(High Density Patch
   Panel)can help the ACI?

   For Ms Warrior, it may involve with "The Controllbility of the Coupled
   System". For HDPP, it is an integration of the ACI.
   Why Cisco not try?

   I read this at 2:00 AM and wanted to re-read it before I posted a
   comment. I'm not completely sold on VMware NSX for network
   virtualization as it is yet to be even released. However, I'd like to
   hear some clarity around your statement that software based network
   virtualization doesn't support multiple hypervisors and doesn't scale.

   As I understand it PayPal (48th most visited site on the Internet) uses
   Nicira v3.0 which tells me that it scales and they have over a combined
   60,000 cores of ESXi and KVM running on their, I'm assuming virtualized
   network. I see this as a discrepancy between Cisco and the Software
   Defined industry (VMware/Nicira). As one of those bloggers that have
   been questioning the strength of VMware/Cisco relationship, I'd like to
   see specifics around these claims.

   During the VMworld keynote, CITI, eBay and GE attested to their
   deployments of Nicira and its capabilities - scale being one of several
   discussed. This appears to conflict with your statement "It doesn't
   scale" among others. Can you offer some context and clarify what you
   meant here and why it's scaled so well with these very large customer
   deployments?

       "During the VMworld keynote, CITI, eBay and GE attested to their
       deployments of Nicira and its capabilities - scale being one of
       several discussed" - No they did not. I attended the keynote. They
       talked about VMware in general, not Nicira. They use ESX heavily,
       but not yet Nicira (I asked).
       In any case, the future is public cloud, not on-prem components
       like Nicira. Witness AWS's remarkable growth. VMware has taken the
       right step by now investing in vCHS. That is the right bet for the
       future, not Nicira.

       John, I as at Scott Carlson's OpenStack session on on Paypal's
       experience integrating ESXi, KVM on OpenStack over their Nicira
       based network. He specifically said they were running Nicira v. 3.

       Anyway Rackspace is using Nicira :) So yeah I guess it scales ...

   I attended the session as well and all three companies spoke about
   VMware nothing specific about the VMware NSX. In addition, the message
   about NSX was not clear define. It seems promising but the question is
   "Can this be possible today?"

   This brings up several issues for me surrounding virtualized network
   components that I haven't yet seen addressed. The first being how do
   software-implemented network functions stackup up against
   ASIC-implemented network functions in terms of performance? Is a VEM,
   for example, faster than a linecard? I'm sure in terms of east-west
   traffic it's as fast if not faster, but what about traffic exiting and
   leaving the area served by the VEMS - north/south traffic?

   Anyone who has worked with cisco equipment has seen that the biggest
   advancements in terms of performance often happen when functions are
   moved from software to custome hardware. So if those are moved back
   into software, isn't that a step back in time?

   So yes idle compute cycles are an opportunity to virtualize, but the
   just doesn't extend logically to the network. Unused bandwidth isn't an
   opportunity to virtualize network components.

   However, when all you have is a hammer, as the saying goes, everything
   looks like a nail. Or a cloud in this case. So it seems like what to
   virtualize and where to leverage hardware is a topic not yet hashed
   out.
