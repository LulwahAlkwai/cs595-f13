Culture Trumps Strategy, Every Time

   Trust, fights, and child care. When I'm advising start-up teams
   nowadays, I ask a lot of questions around those three areas. Which
   makes it sounds more like a marriage counselor's office, rather than a
   boardroom, right?

   Quite often, the teams I'm talking with think culture is some woo-woo
   stuff that doesn't make any difference in the end, or even if they
   think it does matter, they have an excruciatingly hard time describing
   what theirs is.

   Which begs the question: does culture matter?

   Culture's all that invisible stuff that glues organizations together,
   as [48]David Caldwell, my management professor at Santa Clara
   University, taught me many years ago. It includes things like norms of
   purpose, values, approach -- the stuff that's hard to codify, hard to
   evaluate, and certainly hard to measure and therefore manage. Many[49]
   other experts, such as [50]Senge and [51]Kotter have certainly added to
   that understanding with complex and nuanced constructs, but Caldwell's
   invisible glue comment holds a truth.

   This "invisibility" causes many managers to treat culture as a soft
   topic, but it's the stuff that determines how we get things done. For
   example:

   Do We Trust Each Other? A team I was recently working with reminded me
   of 6-year-olds playing soccer, where every team member simply surrounds
   the issue[52] much like a team of kids surrounds the ball. They then
   travel en masse, afraid to move away from the proverbial "ball." In
   this culture, no one owns a position on the field. This "we're all in
   it together" cultural norm is certainly egalitarian, but it doesn't
   support specialization, scale, or accountability. I worry that as this
   team grows, and when they're not all in the same room, they will fail.
   When they are huddling, what they are signaling is that they don't know
   how to trust one another to do their unique part. They -- like many
   teams -- simply don't know how to "let go" to and with others, thus
   risking their ability to scale results.
   Disagreements Mean What? We all know that we want the best ideas to
   triumph for the best innovations to take place, but sometimes we act as
   if that only applies when the idea is our idea. Two members of a team
   were recently disagreeing vehemently on something. Both had facts that
   backed up their point of view. Both were fighting for the benefit of
   the company. Each believed they were "in the right" and wanted the CEO
   to simply pick the winner, making the losing party wrong and mostly
   likely, gone. [53]How we handle disagreements and dissent are also part
   of culture. When teams don't know how to handle disagreement, molehill
   issues can become do-or-die mountains, or, conversely,
   passive-aggressiveness insinuates itself as a mechanism to avoid overt
   disagreements at all costs.

   Who Cares About the Baby? A team that is part of a 50,000+ organization
   recently described an issue where one team does their best right up to
   a handoff milestone, then relinquishes any part of the project's
   ultimate success. They described their discomfort with this using a
   baby analogy. "Will you take care of my [baby] the same way I would,
   knowing our shared goal is to [get this kid to a good college]?" When
   the "baby" or in this case, business performance isn't co-owned by
   everyone, [54]things can easily fall through the cracks. And truth be
   told, that's where most business problems happen in our high velocity
   world; between the cracks of divisions or silos or the "white space" no
   one owns.

   How we get things done drives performance. These issues of trust,
   conflict resolution, and co-ownership are foundational for how a team
   gets work done. Culture is the set of habits that allows a group of
   people to cooperate by assumption rather than by negotiation. Based on
   that definition, culture is not what we say, but what we do without
   asking. A healthy culture allows us to produce something with each
   other, not in spite of each other. That is how a group of people
   generates something much bigger than the sum of the individuals
   involved. If we only get 2+5+10 = 17, we haven't gotten any benefit of
   leverage. What we are looking for is 2*5*10 = 100, delivering an
   explosive return on effort. Culture is the domain that enables or
   obstructs a velocity of function. By addressing where an organization
   is limiting its velocity, you can accelerate the engine that fuels
   innovation and growth, and, ultimately, financial numbers.

   Stephen Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, agrees that
   culture drives numbers: "Culture drives innovation and whatever else
   you are trying to accomplish within a company -- innovation, execution,
   whatever it's going to be. And that then drives results,"[55] he said
   in a New York Times interview. "When I talk to Wall Street, people
   really want to know your results, what are your strategies, what are
   the issues, what it is that you're doing to drive your business. Never
   do you get people asking about the culture, about leadership, about the
   people in the organization. Yet it's the reverse, because it's the
   people, the leadership, and the ideas that are ultimately driving the
   numbers and the results."

   Because we can see the outward manifestations of work performance like
   products shipped, revenues booked, and earnings-per-share, we can
   discuss them in analysts calls and at management meetings. We can
   barely see and surely can't measure the cultural aspect of what makes
   great products, revenues or earnings per share. But that doesn't mean
   it can't be decoded.

   After working on strategy for 20 years, I can say this: culture will
   trump strategy, every time. The best strategic idea means nothing in
   isolation. If the strategy conflicts with how a group of people already
   believe, behave or make decisions it will fail. Conversely, a
   culturally robust team can turn a so-so strategy into a winner. The
   "how" matters in how we get performance. Yes, it does.
