Government Social Media Policy Part 2: For the Employees

   In addition to the [13]external government social media policy that we
   highlighted earlier this week, it is equally important for public
   sector organizations to establish an internal employee-use policy for
   social media.

   The policy should include 3 elements:
    1. Guidelines for personal versus professional use,
    2. A mechanism for an agency to approve and register social media
       sites, and
    3. The ability for oversite and enforcement.

Personal vs. Professional Use

   Any employee-use policy must differentiate between personal and
   professional social media usage, and explain how the rules apply to
   each.

   GSA's [14]Social Media Navigator does a great job of outlining what
   "official use" means:

     When you join Facebook, Twitter and other social sites, you do so
     with different responsibilities. When representing the agency,
     you're speaking in an "official" voice and have been authorized to
     speak for the agency. If you have your own Facebook and Twitter
     sites, you're speaking in a "personal" voice" with your own views
     and opinions.

     The difference between official use and personal use of social media
     is this:

     Personal use: You can do anything that's not illegal.

     Official Use: You can do what you're authorized to do."

Approval and Registration of Social Media Sites

   A fundamental component of the employee-use policy is the section
   describing approval and registration of social media sites.

   Remember: this does not mean that a public affairs office should
   approve every post. But the person in charge of social media should
   approve the actual social media profile. In other words, an agency's
   facebook page should be approved, but not every single post written by
   the agency.

   Why would an agency need to do this, you ask? It's actually a way for
   public affairs to accomplish several goals at once: to ensure brand
   consistency, to provide training, and to ensure that each social
   networking profile serves a distinct and meaningful purpose.

   But wait! There's a bonus. The approval process provides a natural
   entry point for populating and maintaining a [15]registry of the
   organization's social media profiles.

Oversight and Enforcement

   Finally, the employee-use policy should establish rules regarding
   oversight and enforcement. A social media profile created for
   professional purposes ultimately belongs to the organization, and not
   the individual employee.

   Responsible parties in the organization, ranging from public affairs to
   legal, must have the right to monitor and enforce actions on a profile
   when necessary.
