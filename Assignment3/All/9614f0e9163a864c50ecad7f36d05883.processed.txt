[10]August 2013 Web Server Survey

   In the August 2013 survey we received responses from 716,822,317 sites,
   an increase of 18 million. Based on the trends over the last six
   months, Netcraft expects to see 1 billion responsive sites within the
   next 18 months.

   Apache lost a significant amount of market share this month, tumbling
   by 5.23 percentage points. Its market share now stands at 46.96%, the
   lowest since March 2009. This large change was caused by the loss of 28
   million Apache sites, a large gain of 26 million sites powered by
   Microsoft IIS, plus other reasonably significant gains by nginx and
   Google. Google's growth was primarily due to 3.1 million new sites
   using Google's [11]App Engine (appspot.com) infrastructure and 2.7
   million new Blogger sites (blogspot.com).

   The bulk of the changes in Apache and Microsoft web server market share
   this month can be attributed to a single hosting company: Go Daddy was
   previously hosting 25 million sites using Apache Traffic Server on
   Linux, but these are now served by Microsoft IIS 7.5. The machines
   still exhibit the TCP/IP characteristics of Linux, and are likely
   reverse proxies, each of which is serving an average of about 150
   thousand sites. Apache Traffic Server first appeared at Go Daddy during
   Netcraft's [12]May survey. At the time, 75% of all sites hosted by Go
   Daddy were using ATS, which made Go Daddy responsible for hosting 99%
   of all ATS sites in the world.

   Remarkably, this is the first time since December 2009 that Apache has
   not been used by more than half of the world's websites. During that
   period, Apache's market share peaked at 66% in [13]July 2011, although
   its greatest ever market share was observed in [14]November 2005, when
   it hit 71%.

   Despite speculation that the recent [15]PRISM revelations would result
   in a mass exodus from American data centers and web hosting companies,
   Netcraft has not yet seen any evidence of this. Within the most popular
   10 thousand sites, Netcraft witnessed only 40 sites moving away from
   US-based hosting companies. Contrary to some people's expectations, 47
   sites moved to the US, which actually resulted in a net migration to
   the US.

   This trend is also reflected by the entire web server survey, where a
   net sum of 270 thousand sites moved to the US from other countries (in
   total, 3.9 million sites moved to the US, while 3.6 million moved from
   the US). Germany was the most popular departure country, with nearly
   1.2 million sites moving from German hosting companies. This was
   followed by Canada, where 803 thousand sites hopped across the border
   to the US.
