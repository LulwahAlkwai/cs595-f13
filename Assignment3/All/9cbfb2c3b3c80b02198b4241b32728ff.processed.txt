[12]Microsoft + Nokia: Now We're All Like Apple

   Ten years ago, everybody in the tech industry -- and I mean everybody
   -- was convinced that the best way to dominate a technology market was
   to create an operating system and license it to a bunch of other
   companies. "The key to success is creating a standard," said the
   experts. "If you write software for only your own hardware, you'll
   never achieve the economies of scale of a licensed OS, and you'll never
   be able to dominate the market without a wide range of licensees
   selling your hardware."
   The case for licensing seemed obvious because of the success of
   Windows. Apple had kept MacOS to itself, while Microsoft had licensed
   Windows. Microsoft won. Therefore licensing was the best way to go.
   But then Apple transformed the phone market with the iPhone, and
   created the tablet mass market from scratch with the iPad. Suddenly the
   proprietary approach started to look a lot better.
   Ten years later, the idea of an independent operating system licensed
   to all comers is a fading ideal. The two leading operating system
   licensors in mobile have now bought major hardware companies: Google
   with Motorola and Microsoft with Nokia. Both companies continue to
   license their software, of course, but clearly they don't feel that's
   enough. They need to also create hardware.
   When you look at it in terms of tech history, this is a stunning
   change. I'm having trouble thinking of another industry that changed
   its basic assumptions so thoroughly in such a short period of time. I'm
   still trying to sort out what this all means for the rest of us, but
   here are some preliminary ideas:
   Are they fighting the wrong war?  Since the experts were supposedly all
   wrong about licensed OS ten years ago, we should ask whether they might
   all be wrong again today. The standard assumption behind buying a
   hardware company is that by combining hardware and software you can
   produce the sort of fantastic user experiences (and fantastic margins)
   that Apple does. There are a couple of potential problems with that
   reasoning:
   1. There already is an Apple. You can make a good argument that
   Cupertino has already used up most of the customers who are willing to
   pay extra for a value-added smartphone or tablet, and that the
   remaining customers are mostly buying on price. That creates the
   possibility that Microsoft (and the Motorola part of Google) will end
   up with the worst of both worlds: an Apple-like expense structure but
   with commodity margins. Google can afford that since it has the web
   advertising business to subsidize it. Microsoft, with restless
   shareholders and all of its cash cows under threat, has much less room
   to maneuver.
   2. Does combining hardware and software really work? Other than Apple,
   how many integrated hardware-software companies have succeeded wildly
   in mobile? Let's see, there's Palm, BlackBerry, Danger... Apple starts
   to look like the exception rather than the rule. I start to think the
   real lesson is that no strategy will work if you execute it poorly.
   Perhaps Microsoft would have been better off fixing the flaws in its
   licensing model rather than totally changing strategy. But it's too
   later for that, so we should ask why Apple succeeded where so many
   other companies failed.
   Maybe it's because Apple has a culture in which product managers,
   rather than engineers, take the lead in defining products. If that's
   the case, Microsoft will need major cultural changes, and Google, well,
   forget about it.
   Or maybe you just need to have a supernaturally brilliant CEO leading
   the whole thing. Which brings me to my next point...
   Microsoft's next CEO will need to be Superman. Here's the mess Steve
   Ballmer will leave for his successor:
   -Windows 8 has failed to produce a turnaround in Microsoft's gradual
   decline.
   -The Surface tablets have more or less died in the market.
   -The company's just been through a massive top-level organizational
   change. Those things typically take a year to trickle down through the
   organization, as the lower levels of management get resorted and
   reassigned. That process will be disrupted while everyone waits to see
   if the new structure will stick with the new CEO (unlikely; new CEOs
   almost always want to change things).
   -And now Microsoft needs to mesh the Nokia and Microsoft businesses.
   There's a cultural challenge: Nokia's is a collectivist Finnish
   hardware company while Microsoft is a dog-eat-dog hypercompetitive
   software business. There are also operational challenges. As I learned
   when I worked at Palm, it's incredibly difficult to manage an operating
   system to please both your in-house hardware team and your licensees.
   They always want conflicting things. Microsoft claims it can both
   license Windows Phone and run Nokia. I hope that's just bluster,
   because I don't think it will work in practice.
   It's an almost ridiculously complex situation. Who could make all of it
   work? Who has an ego big enough to even try? To me, it feels like a job
   for a mad cartoon genius rather than a human being. Megamind would be
   perfect, or maybe Gru from Despicable Me.
   [13][Megamind+and+Gru.png]
   Either one could do the job
   I'm only joking a little bit. The CEO hire at Microsoft is going to be
   pivotal, and it's difficult to imagine anyone who has the
   qualifications to make it all work.
   Microsoft needs to find a new measure of success. In its presentation
   on the deal, Microsoft bragged about how it's "outselling BlackBerry in
   34 markets" ([14]link). This is not the first time I've seen Microsoft
   use BlackBerry as its measure of success, and it needs to stop. It's
   like bragging that you outran a dead guy in a marathon.
   The conspiracy theorists will love this. Even before the purchase of
   Nokia's phone assets, some Symbian die-hards had muttered that Nokia
   CEO Stephen Elop was a Trojan horse: a Microsoft exec sent to Finland
   with the hidden agenda of destroying the company's value, so it could
   be snapped up by Microsoft. That's certainly the outcome we got, so I'm
   sure the conspiracy buffs are boiling today. But for the record, I
   don't think Elop was a Trojan horse -- Nokia's management was doing a
   very good job of destroying its value long before he arrived.
   What happens next? There are some interesting shoes that might drop
   next. Now that we have three big hardware + software players, will the
   other mobile hardware makers feel pressure to copy them? In particular,
   will Samsung decide that it needs a different operating system? Samsung
   already has Bada OS, which it reportedly plans to merge with the Tizen
   project it's driving with Intel. Maybe it'll feel that's enough. Will
   the Chinese vendors feel pressure to act? If they do, there aren't many
   other operating systems they could buy. Maybe BlackBerry? Would the
   Canadian government allow that?
   That's my quick take, but it's a complicated situation and there's a
   lot more to think about. What do you think it means? I'd love to see
   your comments.
   [Thanks to Adalbert for the correction on Bada.]

          I think for microsoft to succeed it has to be broken up into
          entities that can be better managed, I mean with the addition of
          Nokia there have like more than 100,000 employees!!! I mean that
          like the population of a town! I am not sure how they should be
          broken up like xbox or office or enterprise but I think it would
          be hard or next impossible to get all of them working together
          towards a common goal! Interestingly Microsoft has also
          purchased the ASHA paltform for mobile phones which to me seems
          like they are trying to capture low end market which is still up
          for grabs but is shrinking.
          This looks like a, grab your popcorn, the next few years are
          going to be fun!

          There already is an Apple, minus Steve Jobs, in a smartphone
          niche with falling margins.
          Google merely produces reference Android hardware. The dominance
          of Android reaffirms, that dominance in technology markets means
          creating an operating system and licensing it to a bunch of
          other companies. Microsoft, achieving that in PC's, doesn't
          necessarily mean it can do it again in other markets.

          Fantastic Article.
          What we're seeing in the market right now is a hurdle race where
          the turns are random. One unpredicted turn, and the whole lot of
          them, albeit one or two, are struggling to recover, only to be
          thrown off again at the next bend.
          However, I think what we're seeing here is less of a stab at "is
          this the right method?" and more of an evolution and I'll tell
          you why.
          Until Apple changed the world with the iphone, the tech market
          largely revolved around the business world, and in that world,
          producing a software standard across multiple hardwares was the
          best way to g, because it was cheaper.
          However, Apple proved that the consumer clearly values
          reliability an speed over price point.
          A unified hardware/software model is simpler to market and much
          less dangerous from a quality control perspective. It will allow
          Microsoft to be in control of its marketing and hardware,
          providing a higher level of quality. What Microsoft saw in apple
          was that it's success came from quality and that, I believe,
          shows in its move to change its business model and even in the
          choice of companies to acquire.
          In the end, I think the numbers speak for themselves. We saw
          Apple's model work, but it wasn't a model run on unification -
          it was a model run on quality control. I think if Microsoft can
          keep that in mind through these transitions, they have a shot at
          coming out on the other end of this.

          Nice article, thanks!
          Some comments from me:
          Apples are falling, because there is no more Steve-the-gardener.
          Google bought Motorola for the sake of IP to protect Android.
          And Google is capable of producing reference phones and tablets
          without Motorola anyways.
          MS approach with licensed OS worked well, for a decade, while
          everyone liked to play sysadmins at home. Nowadays, when
          everyone likes seamless experience Apple's approach proved to be
          better.
          Yes, comparing to Palms and Blackberries, Apple is an exception,
          but as we can see with Galaxy sequel, one can make plenty of
          cash with volumes.
          As a result I still see future for Lumias.
          As for SurfaceRT - it is quite good, but one has to understand
          it is 1st generation device, we have to wait and see how the
          market will accept 2nd gen Surface.

          When Windows dominated Microsoft drove events; today they are
          reacting to them. The success of iPhone and iPad allowed Apple
          to drive events in mobile for a time; increasingly they have
          become reactive - and actually quite slow at it! Google's
          reactions seem vague and occasionally contradictory; does anyone
          know what those dudes really want? Do they?
          In a jungle run by Rabbits and Scavengers the food chain becomes
          chaotic. Top predators give life in the jungle some shape. Just
          about the only dude who walks the walk these days is Stephen
          Elop. It makes you wonder - what if HE was running Microsoft?
          I give that option under 40%; but wish it would happen. We need
          some actual lions, not just Rabbits and Scavengers. Lions give
          the jungle some class.

          Nice analysis. I think the reason Microsoft keeps trying to play
          the mobile OS angle is the fact that the 2 dominant players have
          managed to create successful walled gardens. The money is in
          content sales, if you can monetize all of it like Apple does and
          Google tries to also do with some level of success (people
          hacking the OS create some leakage).
          Making Android devices will definitely be a margin squeezed
          industry, but if you can earn enough recurring revenue from
          every customer running your OS, the hardware margins are much
          less important. Thus the purchase of Nokia's smartphone business
          makes sense. This however comes loaded with the featurephone
          business, which has huge volumes, razor thin margins and shared
          production facilities, logistics & sales channel with the
          smartphone unit. It'll be interesting to see what MSFT decides
          do with that. I think this is what they need the Nokia brand for
          10 years for.

          Microsoft's angle is clear. They must protect their Windows
          Phone business, and they might want to turn it into an
          integrated Apple-like business.
          Nokia's angle is less clear. The fact that they are selling
          their feature phone business too probably means that they see no
          way to make money in the phone business. Not in feature phones,
          and not in smartphones. As Nokia used to be quite good at making
          money in the phone business, I think that is the angle needed to
          solve the riddle.

          if Samsung is smart they are working hard on Bada right now. My
          bet is Google will "close off" Android the very moment that it
          makes sense to do so. But as long as it's open they still
          control market share.
          Regarding your enumerated problems:
          1. Apple is "value-added", but combining hardware and software
          doesn't inherently mean paying extra-- in fact it should be the
          opposite. Integration means greater efficiency, and no licensing
          fees would suggest a less expensive product, not more.
          2. Combining hardware and software has a greater chance of
          working than not. Microsoft could still screw it up and make a
          not so great product, but if they go proprietary they eliminate
          all the other licensees that would do an even worse job than
          they, and fracture the market like Android's, both in hardware
          configuration and UI inconsistency.

          1. Samsung killed Bada already, and Tizen is delayed. For now,
          Android + TouchWiz is Samsung's platform play. It doesn't have
          full control, but until Google/Moto sell meaningful global sales
          volumes - which is years off, just to rebuild sales channels -
          it may not matter.
          2. I'm not convinced that Microsoft is buying Nokia because it
          wants to be like Apple - it does want to be like Apple, and that
          explains a lot of other things (Surface, the reorg, etc.) but
          not this, because Microsoft's deal with Nokia was working fine
          for Microsoft. The problem was that the deal was not working
          well for Nokia at all. Yes, volumes are increasing, but not
          fast/big enough, and profits were just not there. Motorola faced
          a similar moment, and Sanjay Jha conned Google into buying them
          for its IP. Elop was really methodical: he had locked Nokia into
          a deal with Microsoft for five years, so there was no chance to
          switch to Android now. Phones weren't working. So he spent his
          remaining cash buying back NSN. That, plus NAVTEQ, provided the
          means to exit the phone business entirely. Nokia represents
          nearly all the Windows Phone volume, so exiting the phone
          business would be disastrous for Microsoft. Buying Nokia is
          better than that scenario (proof point: the deal includes 1.5b
          Euro financing NOT dependent on the deal closing. If Nokia is
          going to continue pursuing Windows Phone, it needs cash for
          operations). Plus Microsoft can now completely control the
          marketing message, plus it gets a good deal on IP, plus Nokia is
          Finnish, so the whole thing can be done with cash that was stuck
          offshore anyway. But I don't think Microsoft really wanted to
          buy Nokia - if it had, it would have done so back when Nokia
          first switched to Windows Phone.

          Looks like Windows Phone is going to leverage Asha to go up
          against Android, and the iPhone 5C to capture the bottom 2/3 of
          the pyramid in Africa, Asia and South America.
          Regardless though, my guess is that the bottom 2/3 of the market
          will be captured by a mix of Chinese shanzhai makers, not the
          leading brands.

          I've come to the conclusion that the top three spots in
          smartphones are taken by Android, iOS and android, where little

          lbeing used as a framework by China Mobile, among others.

          Today; everyone is thinking about whether to do software only or
          bundle the entire experience in technology is the best direction
          for Microsoft;
          The problem with this is that you have already assumed that in
          order for Microsoft to survive it needs to be in the tablet and
          mobile business.
          I think that is the wrong question. The right question is what
          is Microsoft good at in a world demonated by tablets and mobiles
          and what is its value add.
          Microsoft has a history of continuing failures until it
          succeeds; and I think this is not one of them ( Windows vs Mac ,
          Xbox vs PS) they normally just wait until their competition gets
          tired and they add a small value by making it a little better.
          However in this case neither Apple has any reason to get tired (
          best product vision) , nor google ( most used platform to drive
          advertising);
          Therefore Microsoft is fighting the wrong war and will
          ultimately come out not knowing if they won battles or not.
          Instead it should become a company focusing on making the best
          pieces software regardless of platform and web and this way it
          can win the enterprise war forever while ensuring they are
          relevant in future( Office, Skype, Adobe?) using a locked in
          subscription model and tie up all the loose ends (work force,
          crm, erp).
          Bill Gates once said the best way to succeed is to spend a lot
          on capex and let revenues come in future without spending
          incremental costs directly correlated to revenues.
          Microsoft needs to move from OS wars and into best software war
          again to make themselves relevant.

          When the PC market was small, having multiple HW vendors use the
          same OS allowed a larger pool of end users to finance
          development of that OS, thus allowing more resources to be spent
          to innovate faster. An integrated vendor like Apple had less
          resources, but they could maintain better quality control.
          When the PC market grew the advantage of scale has diminished as
          the OS teams have reached saturation in their sizes. At the same
          time HW prices dropped, and consumers started being able to
          afford to pay attention to quality more than they did before. In
          addition as focused moved from PC to mobile, the aversion to
          poor quality became more pronounced.
          So it was the right strategy to have separate OS back then, and
          it is the right strategy to have integrated design now. There is
          no contradiction.

          If Palm had not licensed their operating system, and had instead
          iterated on one integrated device year after year, they could
          have been the ones who created the iPhone. They could have
          created the iPod if they had any idea what they were doing. They
          had all the pieces. But they were distracted by trying to be the
          Microsoft of mobile.

          I wish you would have gone a little deeper regarding Danger,
          other than just mentioning them. Whatever happened to Danger,
          anyway? Oh yeah, that's right, Microsoft bought them, and then
          spent a couple years proving that they didn't know what they
          were doing in the phone space. At all.
          From Ballmer's smug mocking of the iPhone at its introduction,
          to their efforts with the Kin and the Zune, I think they've
          proven that the success that they enjoyed with DOS/Windows and
          Office were their apex, and it's all down hill from there.

          I'm not so enthusiastic about " Now that we have three big
          hardware + software players..." and rather prefer, "Other than
          Apple, how many integrated hardware-software companies have
          succeeded wildly in mobile?"
          Google's Moto operation has potential, but if Moto were a
          free-standing firm, they'd have been written off the same way
          that Nokia has been, as being hopelessly off the cutting edge.
          There's no indication yet that Google got ANYTHING with the
          acquisition other than the cash and the set-top line that they
          spun back out. (The patent portfolio has been a spectacular
          black eye, not even a bust.)
          It seems more likely that the real reason is that competitive
          advantage, or the lack thereof, is striking in the industry.
          Apple has its ecosystem, first-mover advantage, logistics,
          smarts to negotiate hard with carriers and is exploiting iOS for
          every scrap of advantage/differentiation it can get.
          Google, by driving down the value of OSs, has shifted the game
          to scale and might, which have favored Samsung but won't do Moto
          any good. And Microsoft now has/is a failed firm; as Dediu
          points out at Asymco.Com, phone firms just DON'T come back from
          the dead. (I don't recall his justification for his 100%
          correctness of the empirical observation, but he could mumble
          "network effects" if he had to.)
          I'd say more that we are at the first intermission of The
          Incredible Commoditization of Smartphones, an amazingly short 6
          years into the game. Apple knocked out WinMo and RIM as high-end
          competitors, and Samsung killed Nokia. But in the wings are
          dozens of BrandX (or small-a-Android) phones that won't pay
          Microsoft royalties (because they're effectively beyond the
          reach of IP law in China, India and Brazil and because there are
          no margins to cover $10/phone). I'd say Samsung is the least
          well-defended against the hordes, and when we get back to the
          show, we'll be watching their strenuous efforts to differentiate
          themselves from cheaper, local efforts that might enjoy some
          nationalistic sponsorships and will be willing to think they're
          smart because of rapid ramp-up thanks to selling at cost.
          During this act, Apple may--since it's an exceptionally
          savvily-run company--keep its multiple advantages, and stay
          profitable, while Moto and Lumia brands will eventually lose
          their allure as a way to sell something else profitable.

          So many wintards and fandroids STILL dreaming that Apple will
          'go out of business' just so they won't be so embarrassed to be
          using a OBVIOUS copy, and criticizing, rather ignorantly, the
          original.
          PC failed because a PC is a PC is a PC. You only have ONE real
          choice when buying a computer. PC or Mac. That's it. Phone is
          similar, iPhone or Android (like a bad, but speced up copy, for
          geeks who think they are super smart but are not).

          "The case for licensing seemed obvious because of the success of
          Windows. Apple had kept MacOS to itself, while Microsoft had
          licensed Windows. Microsoft won. Therefore licensing was the
          best way to go."
          I'm not following. Who actually thought this, and why? Certainly
          no Mac user: Apple did license Mac OS for a while, and it almost
          killed the company. And the other PC operating systems of the
          1980's (like CP/M) were also licensed and sold independently,
          and they did not become dominant. Clearly, this was not the only
          significant factor.
          In the 1990's, there were a couple other cases where companies
          tried to sell an entire PC hardware/software stack and failed,
          and then switched to software licensing (notably BeOS and NeXT),
          but they failed even after switching to licensing.
          Anyone looking at Microsoft in ~2003 as a reason why licensing
          an OS was the best way forward had to squint really hard to
          ignore every other consumer operating system in history. :-)

          Michael, as usual ... very insightful.
          I'd like to point out something, and somewhat disagree with you
          on one point: that licensing has worked or did work for some
          firms and Apple was the [successful] exception in integration.
          I believe Microsoft was the lone success in the licensing
          business, NOT because the licensing model is a good model
          (business wise or usability wise), but rather because of the
          specific Microsoft practices and shady deals and mere
          opportunities of that specific time period (never to happen
          again).
          Specifically, Microsoft wrangled the licensing model out of
          IBM's hands, using very specific business moves (mostly shady,
          illegal, and down right dirty) during the DOS era .... FUD was
          the highlight of it, as was vapourware. In fact, Microsoft's
          sole "innovation" and contribution to technology has been
          vapourware !!!! That domination, gave them ample opportunity to
          crush OS/2, Novell and other small players during the Windows
          era (this time stealing from and stabbing Apple).
          All of this was possible because Bill Gates was in the driver's
          seat, and he was an extremely shrewd and evil businessman (don't
          be fooled by his latest philanthropic cover-up). In fact Ballmer
          was the "mini-me" of Bill Gates for many years. And if you look
          at Google in the past 5 years, they have been playing
          Microsoft's strategy book from the 1990's down to the t (though
          they claim that they're not evil).
          I'd like to propose that licensing hasn't worked out for anyone
          OTHER than Microsoft !!! It didn't work for Unix (everyone
          rolled their own and the proprietary forks were the only
          successful ones). In fact, in the Unix world the most successful
          (business wise) were Solaris (Sun), HP/UX, IRIX (SGI), and IBM
          AIX. Everyone else lost ....
          So if we go back far enough, the only OS that was licensed and
          made a profit OTHER than Windows was Adobe PostScript !!! And
          that was because it was a monopoly ... in recent years, they've
          obsoleted that technology by PDF.
          All successful platforms of the 80's and 90's were vertically
          integrated .... other than Windows. Apple just happened to be
          the ONLY case of integration that was consumer-facing. Once
          again, "BILL GATES" .... NOT Microsoft ....was the lone
          exception here ....
          And that success will never be repeated again, because all the
          players have learned their lesson ... it's been put through the
          courts and the DOJ, so there is awareness, hence why Google
          couldn't even afford to charge for Android, even if it wanted
          to.
          I also believe that Google's licensing model, in and of itself
          is NOT successful ... that remains to be seen. They're
          indirectly generating revenue from it, and they're still in the
          RED for it .... they still make more money from iOS than their
          own platform.
          On another tangent, Microsoft DOES have a success story with
          integration, and that's XBox. I'll bet the impetus for this
          merger was that, they would repeat that success, but I don't
          think it'll work out the same way. Xbox as home-brewed (like
          Apple products) .... Nokia is a purchase, and much harder to
          integrate.

          good communication platform should be (1) efficient (2) highly
          integrated (due to complexity of both software and hardware,
          processor, TxRx, battery power etc), (3) cost per function
          justified and (4) security. non-integrated format will lack at
          least one of the above mentioned scope.

          Microsoft needs to find a new measure of success. In its
          presentation on the deal, Microsoft bragged about how it's
          "outselling BlackBerry in 34 markets" (link). This is not the
          first time I've seen Microsoft use BlackBerry as its measure of
          success, and it needs to stop. It's like bragging that you
          outran a dead guy in a marathon.
          Huh? The consumer space isn't everything. BlackBerry is very
          much alive and kicking in enterprise, which has always been MS'
          bread and butter.

          somewhat off topic - but it constantly amazes me that companies
          like Microsoft keep putting out PR 'positive spin' messages that
          are so obviously flawed.
          I just got an email extolling the virtues of developing for
          Windows Phone:
          'It has strong consumer momentum, too, growing at a rate 6 times
          faster than the overall Smartphone market according to our
          internal analysis of available data.'
          woo-hoo; Microsoft went from 3% to 4%; I'd definitely be better
          developing for them rather than Android who just went from 60%
          to 65% (numbers invented).
          Not to mention the always suspicious 'according to our internal
          analysis'
          Do they think we're stupid, or do they manage to genuinely
          swallow their own 'good news'. I'd genuinely love to know.

          There already is an Apple...
          That's right, just like there was a a Windows, a MS-DOS, a VHS
          and so on.
          Apple's formula is unique to Apple; unfortunately it's
          increasingly looking like it was unique to Steve Jobs. If
          Microsoft is to survive then it can't be by following someone
          else's recipe for success because there's always a shelf life on
          success - just ask any athlete or Formula One team.
          What the future world needs is a 'digital key' and Microsoft is
          probably one of the few companies big enough and credible enough
          to create it.
          A digital key would be an evolution of the smartphone, a kind of
          phone/car key/house key/digital wallet/id card all rolled into
          one with your settings and personal preferences for different
          environments in your life all included.
          Cars are nearly up to speed with this while smart homes are
          lagging behind in wide-spread adoption, not helped by the Global
          Financial Crisis. NFC is bringing the digital wallet closer and
          I'm sure Japan would love to be a test case for this concept.
          Such a device relies on the 'aspirational device, trickling down
          from the rich to the everyman" which worked so well as a
          business model for the iPhone and could be the solution to the
          problem of "when everything has a computer in it, everything can
          be hacked".

          The other "OS" in the race is the Web. Microsoft was able to
          Embrace, Extend and Extinguish when their competition was
          Netscape; this time they can't.
          Win 8 does attempt to be friendly to web apps. If MS can embrace
          the Web while adding value, they will have a business.

          I think you have misunderstood the Apple of today.
          Perhaps what you write about Apple was true 10-15 years ago.
          (Although, with all the mythology built around this company, who
          can really say?)
          These days, Apple is overwhelmingly a marketing business which
          sells particular types of luxury items to fashion conscious
          consumers. Whether it's an item which integrates software or,
          for that matter, overpriced watches or handbags, it's all the
          same.
          I expect there are still a few old relics in Apple who care
          about software and about achieving a holistic synthesis with
          hardware. There may be some who care about creating industry
          standards. There may be others who wish to create a leading
          platform which excites developers.
          However, they are merely regarded as 'useful idiots' by the
          marketing and finance people who really run Apple.
          I suspect that your problem is that, as a Apple alumni, you are
          fixated by past struggles, like the geriatric general who keeps
          re-fighting old battles in his head. The former Artist-in-Chief
          himself abandoned all that nonsense many years ago (as far back
          as the launch of the first iMac).
          I think you need to try harder to adjust to the reality of the
          situation; just let go of the past.
          Speaking of reality, did you notice how quickly the buzz from
          the recent launch has died down? That's a marketing disaster.
          And that is a very bid deal, since marketing is all this company
          really cares about. If Applie continue in this way, they will be
          doomed to bankruptcy.

          I think there are other aspects to be explored. Namely the role
          of free/open source software and commodity hardware. Whilst 20
          years ago you could have made the claim that licensing your
          successful OS (i.e. an OS for which abundant 3rd party software
          was available) was the path to riches, that clearly turned out
          not to be the case for proprietary server OS/hardware vendors.
          Linux and cheap, well performing commodity x86 hardware came
          along and put the proprietary Unix vendors and their CPU
          architectures (MIPS, Alpha, SPARC, even Power) into perpetual
          decline. Sure there were some niches that survived but in
          general the once large markets are now gone or low margin, and
          the vendor are now service companies. Even if ARM starts growing
          in the server space, it will be commodity ARM-based devices.
          I think it is hard to see anything but the same happening for
          smartphones. It has more or less happened already. Hardware is
          maturing and rapidly becoming commoditised such that relatively
          small outfits can produce competitive mid-high end smartphones.
          Continued integration of SOCs will only make this easier.
          As margins on both the components device become smaller and
          smaller there will be less and less scope for anyone to (1) pay
          to license an OS or (2) expend resources developing a new OS and
          software stack, plus attract sufficient 3rd party developers to
          gain momentum if there is a "good enough" open source or free
          alternative available complete with significant 3rd party
          software support.
          Making andorid free and partially open source, and particularly
          the speed that got develops making apps was the move that
          ensured its success. Once, banks and airlines only made apps for
          iOS, now they all have Android apps too.
          Today non-Android, but linux-based OSs like Jolla can implement
          the Dalvik VM and run Android apps. Thus, Android OS could die,
          but the Dalvik VM based apps could keep living, just on top of a
          different Linux implementation.
          From a consumer perspective, if all you want is the apps that
          can run in the Dalvik VM, as long as the hardware is good
          enough, who cares who the device manufacturer is, or what
          implementation of Linux etc sits underneath?
          With Android commanding such a large market share, I find it
          hard to envision iOS remaining the exclusive home to apps that
          people want. Thus, Apple can continue to do what Apple does, and
          everyone else will take the "cheap and good enough" route of
          commodity hardware, linux kernel and Dalvik VM. Device
          manufacturers could make their own flavour of Linux+Dalvik but I
          can't see them succeeding at creating an entirely new ecosystem
          for developers to support.
          Access to hardware drivers will remain a problem for widespread
          adoption of non-vendor supported non-Android Linux+Dalvik VM OSs
          like Jolla.
