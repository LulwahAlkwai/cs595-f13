PDF versus HTML - a shared future!

   As you may know, over the past few years the [21]Article of the Future
   team at Elsevier has introduced an array of article content innovations
   to enhance the online reading experience. More details on the most
   recent of these can be found in the article [22]How to handle digital
   content in this edition of Editors' Update.

   With so many of these innovations already live and functioning
   on [23]ScienceDirect, we thought the time was ripe to poll researchers
   about their thoughts on the future of the scientific article format -
   in particular the online version (HTML) and the traditional PDF. We
   posed a series of questions to a 500-strong online group of
   researchers, whose members represent a variety of disciplines
   worldwide*. Their answers provided some interesting food for thought.

How we conducted the survey

   The survey was divided into two phases. We began by asking participants
   for their thoughts on both the HTML and the PDF. We asked them to
   outline the pros and cons of accessing and reading articles in both
   formats and which had their preference. We also asked them to indicate
   which format they expected to be using in the future.  Once they had
   completed their answers, participants entered stage two. This involved
   viewing a [24]video outlining Elsevier's Article of the Future project,
   which focuses on enriching content in a discipline-specific manner.
   They were then presented with a second set of questions.

   During the first stage, key insights gained included:
     * Researchers favor the PDF format primarily for in-depth reading -
       they find the HTML format more convenient and suitable for
       discovering content and determining its relevance.
     * Researchers feel there will be a place for both HTML and PDF
       formats in the future: PDF for offline access and the storage of
       content for later reference, HTML for online access and immediate
       learning and discovery.
     * If we want to promote the uptake of HTML, we need to address
       concerns around author input, printing, storing and sharing
       content, and make the HTML layout customizable.

   In the words of one participant: "If the article contains interactive
   elements, then (the) HTML version would make more sense; otherwise
   (the) good old PDF will be preferable."

   Other participant comments included:

     "There exist so many articles. And it's hard to open or download
     whenever I find interesting things. So it's more reasonable to read
     (the) HTML version first."

     "I prefer to work with the printed version of the article because I
     don't like reading from (the) screen."

     "I use articles in the HTML format because they may contain links to
     additional information and tools (missing in PDFs)."

     "PDF version is formatted just like the article in print, I can
     easily navigate to the places I want."

     "HTML files are ok on the screen but messy to handle downloaded. But
     I do sort normally on abstract or relevant info I get in the HTML
     environment, before I click on the PDF icon for download."

     "I prefer to share the article URLs rather than sending big PDF
     files around."

     "(The PDF) looks and feels more like a paper article.  If I want to
     print it, I think it will look better printed from PDF.  If I want
     to save or email it, it is easier with PDF."

   IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg, Senior Vice President Journal & Content
   Technology, leads Elsevier's Content Innovation team. He was not
   surprised by the findings of the first stage of the research. He
   explained: "These replies match the ones received in earlier Article of
   the Future studies, which led us to develop the three-pane article view
   now available on ScienceDirect. The PDF-style center pane is ideal for
   reading the paper while the other two panes offer a series of
   discipline-specific presentation and content enrichments that add real
   value to the article. The preference for a PDF format when printing is
   something that the Article of the Future project is taking into
   consideration: we are currently looking into how we can make the center
   pane easy to print, while maintaining its optimized reading format."

   and Cultural Heritage on ScienceDirect, displayed using the three-pane
   view.

Phase two

   In the second stage of the survey, participants were shown the Article
   of the Future video (below), which discusses recent improvements to
   article presentation, content and context and the introduction of the
   article three-pane view on ScienceDirect.

   hd=1&iv_load_policy=3&wmode=transparent&modestbranding=1&autoplay=0

   When asked if the video had changed their perception of the usability
   of the HTML format, 60% agreed it had, while 25% said it hadn't and 15%
   were unsure. A sample of participants' comments is recorded below.
   60% said: `Yes, it has changed my perception' 25% said: `No, it has not
   changed my perception'
   "I conventionally don´t like html articles because of the way they are
   presented in the screen, nevertheless, the Article of the Future is
   taking the traditional way to a new frontier, beyond hypertext to
   metacontent management by user or reader." "This is more or less what I
   can see on some programming software, but applied to articles, good
   idea but questions remain: How will it age? How expensive to maintain?
   How to keep it alive and operational?"
   "Elsevier has used the power of the internet to make sure the article
   is a truly dynamic, interactive and well annotated and connected
   scientific document." "Logical path forward. The current problem is
   that not all users are equipped with appropriate technology, nor do
   they master it."
   "I like the interaction with the content, and the ease of exploring
   other links and references without having to go back to search for them
   later." "...as long as I cannot download it, it's hard to archive and I
   prefer reading it offline."
   "I think there's a great deal of advantages to providing the option to
   publish in such a format. I would be interested to see how authors can
   access the tools to represent their data in these new formats." "It
   offers greater interactivity - but there again a much more powerful PDF
   viewer (with interactive tools built in) would preserve PDF's
   ascendancy."
   "... much more powerful than pdfs that I currently use." "I didn't see
   how the features were relevant to articles, only handbooks and
   textbooks."

   More than 65% thought there would be a shift towards HTML use in the
   future.

   We also asked participants to let us know whether they expected the way
   they access and use articles today to change in the future. Their
   responses varied:
   Yes                   30.8%
   Maybe                 50.0%
   Probably not          10.3%
   No                    3.2%
   Don't know / not sure 5.8%

   Aalbersberg commented: "The digital revolution has radically changed
   the way in which scientists carry out their research, and process and
   store their results. It is clear that as long as technology develops,
   the way scientists access and use articles will develop as well - the
   important question is: How and by how much? 20 years ago the only
   article format was paper, some 10-15 years ago the format became PDF,
   and now a new way of usage has been created by the introduction of
   tablets. Does that mean that we threw away paper and will now throw
   away desktop computers? No - we apply the format and way of use that is
   applicable at the moment of use. And the same will hold for PDF and
   online HTML: I think that there is a future for both. PDF will remain
   the preferred format for archiving and offline use, while online HTML
   will increasingly become the standard for online use, as it is so much
   richer and in tune with the ongoing developments in the regular
   research process."

       It is my understanding that a pdf is secure, that is it cannot
       contain a virus or Trojan horse. It is my understanding that this
       is not true for HTML. If this is correct, then I would suggest that
       this is a very important consideration that should be in the
       discussion.

            [35]July 2, 2013 at 7:55 am
            Dear Professor Palmer,
            Thank you for your comment and it is good that you bring up
            the issue of viruses and security. A very important topic
            indeed, and one I am happy to comment on.
            Technically, a PDF could contain a virus or a Trojan horse,
            but Elsevier has taken various measures to prevent their
            occurrences, like using industry-standard PDF creation tools
            as well as employing validation and detection tools. We have
            also ruled out that our PDFs contain scripting, by adhering to
            the `PDF-A standard'. This high level of protection, however,
            only applies to our in-house generated PDFs, like the
            full-text article PDFs. If we post a PDF from an author
            (embedded as a supplementary file), then a virus or Trojan
            horse could potentially be included. Even though we have
            detection software in place to also scan for malicious
            elements in these files, a yet-unknown virus could slip
            through.
            You are right that HTML could include JavaScript code that
            calls in viruses. However, in ScienceDirect we do control our
            own HTML, and we take good care that this situation doesn't
            happen. Though, when an author-provided HTML is submitted as a
            supplementary file, or when a reference link is followed to a
            web page outside of ScienceDirect, we cannot make any
            guarantee about any scripting that might possibly be
            encountered. And the same holds for a link that might look
            like it is going to download a PDF, but actually redirects
            through one or more intermediate steps that involve HTML
            pages.
            Summarizing, though in general one could say that PDF files
            can also be harmful, (though probably in much lesser quantity
            than arbitrary HTML web pages), in the case of Elsevier's, and
            probably most other STM publishers', full-text articles, the
            risk of either a harmful PDF or HTML format is probably
            negligible.
            Kind regards, IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg

       I like pdf files because of the ease of access. But when I first
       started school I liked html files because they looked easier too
       read. The further I got in school the more annoyed I got by html
       because the writing looked more prepublished and unfinished,
       whether it was or not. Pulling a pdf off the world wide web is
       danger because you can download any amount of dangerous material
       but on a secure website like school or other specific databases it
       is a work of wonders. Though the access to such locations is
       minimal for most of the general public. Yet I cannot find any html
       anywhere on the world wide web, at least I can't.

       I agree with the general view that both HTML and PDF are useful
       formats. My preference, however, is PDF and I would argue that many
       of the advantages of HTML are also features of PDF.
       Enriched and interactive content: PDFs support the embedding or
       linking to multimedia, which includes video and audio. In addition,
       most modern PDF provide web links to cited references (where
       available) and, provided the URLs are stable, can be easily linked
       with data repositories.
       Easy to search: Most modern PDF readers have extensive and powerful
       search tools that can be easily use to efficiently search single
       documents, or folders with multiple PDFs. Searching multiple papers
       via HTML is not as straightforward.
       Includes supplementary material: Several journals (e.g., PNAS)
       support PDFs that are the standalone paper, or are the paper with
       associated supplementary material.
       File size will always be an issue for PDFs, particularly when they
       are heavily loaded with multimedia content. In this respect, HTML
       comes into its element by allowing users to selectively view
       content. The disadvantage of this is the need to always be online.
