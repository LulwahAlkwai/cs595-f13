   GUEST MENTOR [59]Joe Green, president and founder
   of [60]FWD.us: America has a lot to be proud of. And high on the list
   is the fact that so many people throughout the world see the U.S. as a
   beacon of opportunity, a place where they can make the best use of
   their energy and talent. It is a good challenge to have, if only we can
   deal with it sensibly.

   The great cities of history--places like Athens, Rome, London, Hong
   Kong, New York and my hometown, Los Angeles--have been magnets for
   talent. In a global economy, it is now nations that are the talent
   magnets. In all of the world, America is the pre-eminent magnet
   economy. This is no accident. The strength and resilience of our
   institutions, our freedom and our rule of law are, of course, an
   important part of this. But I would contend that the key factor that
   sets us apart from other potential magnets is our rich history as a
   nation of immigrants.

   In its early days, America could have relied on the fact that it was
   rich in natural resources. Instead, ahead of most other nations, we
   realized that our most precious resource is our people, and so we
   invested in universal public education. Fed by a stream of risk-taking
   immigrants, America became the diverse and cosmopolitan nation it is.

   History has more than justified America's recognition of its people as
   its most important resource. We are now in the midst of a sea-change to
   a globalized knowledge economy. New companies, fueled by ideas rather
   than resources, can locate anywhere in the world. Where they will
   locate will depend on the availability of talented people. This is
   where it pays to be a magnet economy.

   Talent begets talent, and ideas beget ideas. The arrival of a talented
   person launches a cascade of events--new products, new opportunities,
   and eventually new companies. This is the multiplying effect of talent.
   Jobs in the knowledge economy are not zero-sum. Talented people do not
   "take" jobs, they create them.

   This is especially true in the tech industry. Having founded two
   startups, I have seen that what matters most for the success of tech
   companies is talented people. Availability of talent is what enables or
   limits their growth. New tech startups can locate anywhere in the
   world; most would prefer to locate in the U.S. When they come here, it
   is a win for our economy. They create American jobs.

   As startups grow into major companies, they want all of their engineers
   in one office. Telecommuting doesn't work for the intense
   collaborations needed at a tech company. Each engineer that is hired
   creates other jobs, at the companies they are helping to grow, and
   additionally in their capacity as consumers. Only when tech companies
   cannot find enough qualified people at home do they open engineering
   offices overseas.

   Which brings us to immigration. Beyond its moral dimensions, it is an
   economic issue. Whenever a talented person is turned away for lack of a
   visa, whenever someone with big dreams cannot get a scholarship because
   of his or her immigration status, whenever an entrepreneur sets up
   shop somewhere other than in the U.S for lack of a green card, whenever
   a company creates a "holding pen" in another country for its employees
   to work while they await visas, we are reducing our strength as a
   magnet economy. Worse, we are turning our back on our heritage as a
   nation of immigrants.
