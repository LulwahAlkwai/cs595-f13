How to Listen When Someone Is Venting

   Disclaimer: It's probably not a good idea to read this before you eat.

   I still remember how it felt when, as a medical student, I drained my
   first abscess in a patient. We called the procedure "I & D" which
   stands for "Incision and Drainage" (I told you not to read this just
   before you eat).

   When you do an I & D, you locate what is the most protruding and
   bulging part of the abscess, wipe it off with alcohol, than pierce it
   with a scalpel. At that point the pus comes out first, followed by any
   blood. After this procedure, you may put the person on an antibiotic.
   Over time, the wound heals from the inside out. If you don't drain the
   abscess first, and just start with the antibiotics, the undrained pus
   may prevent the wound from healing.

   Today as a practicing business psychiatrist and CEO advisor, I've
   noticed that when you're faced with an upset customer, client,
   employee, shareholder, child, parent, spouse, friend, it can actually
   feel like they're bulging with emotion and about to explode. Your
   instinctual and intuitive reaction may be to try to calm them down,
   urge them to cool off, suggest it's not worth getting so upset about.
   And sometimes that may work. But in cases where they're really upset,
   you may need to drain their emotional abscess just as you would have to
   do with a physical abscess. In those situations, asking them to calm
   down before they've vented will be about as useful as skipping straight
   to antibiotics before cleaning their wound.

   And yet a lot of people don't know how to listen to someone venting.
   Usually, people take one of two attitudes. Option 1 is to jump in and
   give advice -- but this is not the same as listening, and the person
   doing the venting may respond with "Just listen to me! Don't tell me
   what to do." Option 2 (usually attempted after Option 1) is to swing to
   the other extreme, and sit there silently. But this doesn't actively
   help the person doing the venting to drain their negative emotions.
   Consequently, it is about as rewarding as venting to your dog.

   The way to listen when someone is venting is to ask them the following
   three questions:

   1. What are you most frustrated about? This is a good question because
   when you ask them about their feelings, it often sounds condescending.
   And if you start out focusing on their anger, it sounds as if you are
   coldly telling them to get a hold on themselves, which may work, but
   more often will just cause the pressure inside them to build up even
   more. However, asking them about their frustration is less judgmental
   and can have the same effect as sticking a scalpel into their abcess.
   Let them vent their feelings and when they finish, pick any of their
   words that had a lot of emotion attached. These can be words such as
   "Never," "Screwed up," or any other words spoken with high inflection.
   Then reply with, "Say more about "never" (or "screwed up," etc.) That
   will help them drain even more.

   2. What are you most angry about? This is where their emotional pus
   drains. Again let them finish and have them go deeper by asking them,
   "Say more about _________ ." Don't take issue with them or get into a
   debate, just know that they really need to get this off their chest --
   and if you listen without interrupting them, while also inviting them
   to say even more, they will. If you struggle to listen when someone is
   venting because intense negative feelings make you feel upset yourself,
   try this: Look them straight in the left eye (which is connected to
   their right emotional brain) and imagine you are looking into the eye
   of a hurricane, allowing whatever they're yelling to go over your
   shoulders instead of hitting you straight in your eyes.

   3. What are you really worried about? This is like the blood that comes
   out of wound following the pus. It is as the core of their emotional
   wound. If you have listened and not taken issue with their frustration
   and anger, they will speak to you about what they're really worried
   about. Again push them to go deeper by asking them: "Say more about
   ___________." After they finish getting to the bottom of it, respond
   with, "Now I understand why you are so frustrated, angry and worried.
   Since we can't turn back time, let's put our heads together to check
   out your options from here. Okay?"

   As I have written [48]before, when people are upset, it matters less
   what you tell them than what you enable them to tell you. After they
   get their feelings off their chest, that's when they can then have a
   constructive conversation with you. And not before.
