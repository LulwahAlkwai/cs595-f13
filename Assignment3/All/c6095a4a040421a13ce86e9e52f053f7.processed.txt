The Influential CIO

   [21]5 Replies

   This article is based on my [22]Persuasive Communication and Influence
   workshop.

   The CIO role spans and must influence all parts of an organization
   without directly controlling them. Today's trends -- global, mobile,
   data-driven virtual business -- increase the stakes and make CIO
   influence not only important for the CIO's personal success but for the
   success of the company as well. This requires skills and competencies
   that may not come naturally to many IT leaders.

   There are two main trends that are driving a shift in power in IT.

   Storm over the South China sea

   First is the ongoing integration of information technology into all
   aspects of business, from the way work gets done to the very products
   companies sell. This is causing massive changes in both business and
   operating models, affecting people, process and organizational
   structures, according to [24]a recent study by Harvard Business Review
   Analytic Services (note: this is a PDF file). As a consequence, a lot
   more people have a lot more to say about what happens when it comes to
   IT.

   The second trend is the "consumerization" of IT. Technology is
   everywhere. Both employees and customers - especially younger ones -
   transact and interact through mobile devices, easy-to-use applets and
   social networks. In the process, they have come to expect a certain
   type of experience - and they increasingly want the choice to be their
   own.

   While these trends in one sense have a kind of democratizing effect,
   that does not mean decisions about and management of IT are any easier;
   quite the contrary. To the average consumer, technology seems simple -
   and that's a good thing. But as any CIO knows, achieving simplicity in
   the technology world is not simple at all.

IT leaders must learn to lead through collaboration and influence.

   With technology more central to business operations and outcomes, IT
   has a greater responsibility for company performance and results. At
   the same time, there are more stakeholders involved, so IT has less
   direct control over the decisions that will determine those results. IT
   leaders must learn to lead through collaboration and influence.

   Influential leaders share three common traits.

   Credibility: They have built credibility with business colleagues and
   employees by first and foremost delivering the fundamentals. Successful
   CIOs refer to this as "table stakes" - the price to get into the game.
   If you haven't been able to deliver services reliably and securely, no
   one's going to listen to or be inclined to go along with your ideas.
   Credibility is increased when CIOs engage with colleagues' most
   important business challenges and successfully devise solutions to help
   them meet their goals.

   Trust: Influential leaders have earned the trust of their colleagues by
   doing what they said they would do - everything from meeting project
   deadlines to delivering the right capabilities and results - again and
   again. Trust is deepened by sticking to commitments even when times are
   tough.

   Relationship: Influential leaders develop strong relationships over
   time. These relationships are certainly enabled by credibility and
   trust, but it takes more than that. They also require the less tangible
   elements of identification and liking. Various studies support the idea
   that people like and prefer to work with people who are like them in
   some important way. If you can't find common ground with your
   colleagues - if IT is viewed as somehow different and separate from the
   rest of the business - your work will be that much harder. Fostering
   positive feelings of liking in this context happens by showing people
   that you're interested in their goals, problems and lives - and that
   you can relate to them on a human level - because - no surprise -
   people tend to feel kindly toward people who like them! One of the most
   fundamental laws of human behavior is that of reciprocity: If you like
   me, I'm more inclined to like you. And if you do something for me, I'm
   more likely to do something for you in return.

   The pace of change today is hurricane force - and IT is right at the
   center of the storm. The goal no longer can be for IT to keep up with
   business or end users or customers - things are happening too fast for
   that - but to make the journey together. Sometimes one group may be out
   ahead, sometimes another, but in a strong relationship based on
   credibility and trust, the CIO will always have a leadership role to
   play. It just may not look like what you expected.

       Where does the ability to influence culture fit? If there is a
       general culture of mistrust, silo-building is it the role of the
       CIO to influence a shift in the culture. Or is it time to `get
       out'?

            Changing culture is possible but really hard. The CIO
            certainly can't do it on his/her own. The CEO has to drive
            that, and it has be be a long-term, company-wide effort. If
            culture change is required and the CEO's not on board, I'd say
            it's time to get out. See my slideshare preso on that:

       Hi Abby. It's been awhile. I agree with your emphasis on influence.
       It has been one of the modules in our IT Leadership Program at
       Santa Clara University. I continue to struggle with what to include
       under the subject of influence. Having spent one career in sales
       and marketing, I know there are aspects of these that make someone
       more influential. More recently, however, I have included pure
       influence styles and some of the work by Robert Cialdini on
       influence. I continue to see how broad a subject influence really
       is. We should compare notes. Nice job on the blog.

            Hi Pete - I really like Cialdini's work on influence. Also
            Terry Bacon. I'd love to catch up and will follow with an
            e-mail. Great to hear from you!
