Twitter's IPO Filing: What It Means

   Calm down, Internet: [48]Twitter is not going public just yet, nor any
   time in the next month or so at the very least. The company has
   [49]filed a "confidential" S-1 IPO with the SEC, meaning it signaled
   its intent to go public at some point and is getting its paperwork
   ducks in a row.

   Why is the filing confidential? So-called "emerging growth" companies
   are allowed to so that now, according to the Jumpstart Our Business
   Startups (JOBS) act signed into law last year.

   See also: [50]How Much Is Twitter Worth?

   JOBS allows you to file so-called "black box" registration documents
   with the SEC if you have less than $1 billion in annual revenue. (We
   never believed Twitter to have more than that number coming in.)

   You have to reveal the filing 21 days before starting any kind of "road
   show" to large investors. Until then, you don't even have to tell
   anyone that you filed. In theory, this allows companies to pull their
   IPO documentation if the response is tepid, and no one will be any the
   wiser.

   So why reveal it at all? Twitter must have reckoned that word would
   leak at some point. Better to get ahead of the story -- and there's no
   better way for Twitter to trumpet the power of its service than to
   reveal the news in a tweet.

   Did Twitter actually file the confidential document today? Not
   necessarily. It looks like the tweet in question was carefully worded
   to not give any kind of time frame. This could have been done weeks
   back -- perhaps back when a company spokesperson used nothing but an
   ellipses, which have now become Twitter-famous, to [51]respond to a
   reporter's question about IPO rumors.

   When will the IPO happen? That's anyone's guess. Facebook announced its
   IPO filing in February 2012 and went public in May 2012. If Twitter
   were on that kind of schedule, you should expect a launch in December.

   But the holidays wouldn't be the best time to launch a company. (Yes,
   Zynga and Groupon launched around then, but that kind of proves the
   point.) Squeezing in the investment road show between three weeks from
   now and Thanksgiving would be tight. Furthermore, Facebook isn't
   exactly a model for how to [52]do an IPO right. We wouldn't be
   surprised if Twitter takes a little more time to do it right and
   launches in early 2014.

   UPDATE: [53]Fortune is reporting a "source close to the company" said
   to expect the S-1 filing to go public in the next few weeks, which does
   in fact put us on track for a December launch.

   How much will it be valued at? Again, that's very speculative. In
   January, one analyst [54]said the company was worth $11 billion. More
   recently, sources inside the company [55]told GigaOm that hedge funds
   had tried to buy the company outright -- for around $14 billion, or
   around $27 a share. Don't be surprised if Twitter prices its shares
   below that.

   What should we look for in the S-1 filing? Whenever it is unveiled, the
   big question is revenue, and how far under a billion dollars it is
   (analysts are guessing it's in the $500 million range). Just as
   important: where that revenue is coming from.

   Twitter CEO [56]Dick Costolo has said that the company makes more money
   via mobile apps than it does from advertising on the web, which gives
   it a leg up on Facebook's IPO. Facebook had effectively zero mobile ad
   revenue when it went public.

   Twitter is probably never going to be as big a deal as Facebook, now
   valued at $108 billion after a year of ups and (mostly) downs -- that's
   just above where it was when it went public.

   But depending on how smart the company has been about its advertising
   strategy, and how much more engaged its users are seen to be, its IPO
   could see far fewer bumps in the road.

   What questions do you have about the Twitter IPO? Let us know in the
   comments.
