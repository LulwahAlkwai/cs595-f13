[10]I'd just die without old radio

   The title, "I'd just die without old radio", was uttered to me
   yesterday. It was not tongue-in-cheek, but rather a true sentiment.  I
   know this becuse the person telling me was my brother.
   Here's the short version of a very long story: recently, my long, lost
   brother knocked on my door.  He needed help; worse, he was in a life or
   death situation (or at least, very close to it.)
   Needless to say, I took him in.  Better yet, my relationship with my
   brother, which had been badly damaged over the years, has been
   repaired.
   I've always known my brother enjoyed old radio.  I have no television
   at my house.  What can one do for entertainment, especially right
   before bed?  Well, listen to OTR, of course.
   I hooked him up a small iPod and 500 random shows.  He loved it.  Loved
   it so much that he now goes to bed early to listen to it.  It so
   reminds me of when I was a young teen; I couldn't wait to get under the
   covers and listen to OTR.  He basically told me this yesterday (he's
   almost 61 years old.)  He told me that he'd die if something happened
   to the iPod or I took it away from him and he wouldn't be able to
   listen to OTR!  He's hopelessly addicted and this is a GOOD addiction.

   [1709]Jimbo
          Way-too busy-guy whose main hobbies are old-time radio and
          EXTREME blogging. I'm always busy, always occupied. I love Jesus
          Christ and enjoy music, baseball, old films, politics, history,
          WWII, telling whoppers ala McGee, winter, documentaries,
          researching anything, old advertisements, 'coincidences'-
          synchronicity, olives, hamburgers and computers (since 1982!)
          Self-taught musician, I've been writing music since age 9 and
          can play over 30 instruments.
