    <h2>Semantic Web Challenge 2013 - Call for Participation</h2>

    <p>
      Submissions are now invited for the 11th Semantic Web Challenge, the premier event for demonstrating practical progress towards achieving the vision of the Semantic Web.
      The 11th Semantic Web Challenge will take place at the <a href="http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/">12th International Semantic Web Conference</a> in Sydney, Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Semantic Web Challenge will consist of two tracks: the <b>Open Track</b> and the <b>Big Data Track</b>.
      The key difference between the two tracks is that the Big Data Track requires the participants to make use of large-scale data sets.
      The Open Track has no such restrictions.
      The Challenge is open to everyone from industry and academia. The authors of the best applications will be awarded prizes and featured prominently at special sessions during the conference.
    </p>

    <h2> Important Dates </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Friday, September 20, 2013, 23:59 CET:</b> Submissions due </li>
      <li>October 23-25, 2013: Semantic Web Challenge takes place at ISWC 2013</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please note that you need a visa to enter Australia.  You can find more information about <a href="http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/content/visa-information">the visa process</a> on the ISWC website.
      <b>You may have to apply for a visa before the SWC deadline!</b>
      We unfortunately cannot assist with late visa applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenge Criteria</h2> 
 
    <p>
      The Challenge is defined in terms of minimum requirements and additional desirable features that submissions should exhibit.
      The criteria for the Semantic Web Challenge 2013 are described on the <a href="criteria.html">Criteria</a> page.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Participate</h2>

<!--
    <p>
      Visit <a href="http://challenge.semanticweb.org/">http://challenge.semanticweb.org/</a> to register for the Semantic Web Challenge by submitting the required information as well as a link to the application on the <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swc2013">online registration form</a>. 
    </p>
-->

    <p>
      The following information must be provided:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Abstract: no more than 200 words. </li>

      <li> Description: The description should show details of the system, including why the system is innovative, which features or functions the system provides, what design choices were made and what lessons were learned. The description must include an appendix of 1-2 pages summarising explicitly how participants have addressed the evaluation requirements (including mandatory and any relevant desirable criteria). Papers should not exceed eight pages (including the appendix) and must be formatted according to the same guidelines as the papers in the Research Track (see <a href="http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/">http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/</a>). 
      </li>
      <li> Web access: The application should be accessible via the web. If the application is not publicly accessible, passwords should be provided. A (short) set of instructions on how to start and use the application should also be provided on the web page. </li>
    </ol>

<p>
Please submit the description of your system (including the appendix) via <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swc2013">EasyChair</a>.
</p>


    <p>
      Descriptions (including the appendix) will be published in the form of online proceedings on the Semantic Web Challenge website.
    </p>

    <h2>Judging and Prizes</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to submitting a system description and working demo, all participants are required to present their systems at the posters and demos session at the ISWC conference.
      A jury consisting of experts from industry and academia will be appointed to judge the systems at the conference.
      In the first round of judging, the jury will take into consideration the descriptions submitted, the online demos, and the presentation at the conference, in order to determine an initial set of up to eight finalists.
      The entries will be scored by the judges and the eight highest scoring entries will then proceed to the second round of the competition.
      The split between the two tracks will be determined according to the proportion of entries in each track.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eight finalists will proceed to the second round of the competition, where they will have to present their work in an open session the following day.
      They will have a slot of approximately 15 minutes to present their work.
      The judges will be present and will evaluate the systems in more detail, according to the specific <a href="criteria.html">criteria </a> detailed on the website.
      The judges will then meet in private to discuss the entries and to determine the winners. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A monetary prize will be provided to the winners of each track, along with publicity for their work.
      There will normally be three winners of the Open Track and one winner of the Big Data track.
      However, the organisers reserve the right to merge the tracks in the event of insufficient submissions in either category.
      The winners will be announced and prizes awarded during the Closing Ceremony of ISWC. 
      The winners also have the chance to submit their work to a Special Issue of the Journal of Web Semantics.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the event that one of the tracks receive less than a minimal number of submissions, the organizers reserve the right to merge the two tracks of the competition.
    </p>
