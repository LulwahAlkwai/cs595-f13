   Tel-aviv
   [47]Monty%2520munford-1550
   By Monty Munford2013-09-12 10:02:23 UTC

   The Israeli startup scene needs little introduction. Tel Aviv is
   rapidly becoming one of the most innovative tech hubs on the planet,
   vying with London, New York and Berlin as Silicon Valley's second.

   Big acquisitions, such as [48]Waze to [49]Google and [50]Snaptu to
   [51]Facebook, as well a upcoming IPO for Outbrain means Israeli
   startups are aspiring for big exits.

   Israeli startups.

   wherein frequent users can earn points for free rides and other
   contingent benefits.

   Brow.si scans the site's RSS feed and converts it to a push

   differentiating it from [63]Skype.

6. [64]ClearSkyApps

   Based in Tel Aviv and founded in 2010, Clear Sky Apps has developed
   more than 15 iPhone apps based on fitness and health programs. Its apps

   patented computer vision technology, which allows drivers to check

   and recommends pumping, if necessary.

8. [67]Swayy

   clubs. Travelers can eat in strangers' houses during their trips.

   meals in their homes. Initiated in Israeli homes, it now services every
   continent.

10. [69]PrimeSense

   With PrimeSense's 3D sensing technology, digital devices can observe a
   scene in three dimensions. It translates these observations into
   synchronized image streams (depth and color). Then, it translates those
   synchronized images into information, identifying human gestures,
   classifying objects and locating walls and floors. This technology is
   made possible by "depth sensing," using sensors and middleware.

   cards free, but is charging a one-time price of $9.99 to protect up to

   will become intuitive and grow sales.

10 Must-Have Tools for Entrepreneurs

    1. Behance%2520action%2520runner

1. [83]Behance Action Runner
       Good design breeds great productivity, say the creatives at
       Behance, who developed The Action Method. That's what sets this pad
       apart from a regular yellow legal notebook. The visual design
       reminds you to describe ideas in action steps rather than just
       jotting them down, in line with Behance's philosophy of "Making
       Ideas Happen."
    2. 57f91312

2. [84]Evernote
       Each device has a different form factor, and maintaining
       consistency takes the stress out of to-do lists and project
       management. Evernote is a clear winner. You can use it on your
       desktop or through a smartphone app -- but if you're on a shared
       computer, you can also sign in through a web browser.
       The company has allowed the app to integrate with other tools
       through [85]IFTTT, further reducing friction.
    3. 2f57875e

3. [86]Google Docs
       The [87]built-in chat and real-time editing make Google Docs
       awesome for collaboration. Even if you're working on your own, it's
       great to have your documents stored in the cloud and accessible on
       any web-enabled device. Auto-save ensures that the most recently
       updated version of a document is always available.
       Text docs are most popular, but don't forget that you can create a
       form and embed it on any site -- which is wonderful for getting
       feedback from users. The spreadsheet doc is great for a simple
       budget or keeping track of employee's contact information.
    4. B4e943a5

4. [88]Dropbox
       If getting a million emails asking for a high-res version of the
       company logo drives you crazy, Dropbox is the answer. Files can get
       lost in inboxes or just be too large to send via email; Dropbox is
       a perfect solution to keep track of various product design
       iterations and assets.
       Dropbox for Teams allows you to give each member different
       permissions to collaborate effectively. You can even share large
       files with partners or the press even if they don't have Dropbox.
       Check out [89]Dropbox's nifty calculator to see if Dropbox for
       Teams is a fit for you.
    5. 91e91445

5. [90]MailChimp
       Despite the fancy social networks we see released each day, email
       is still one of the best ways to connect with customers. The sooner
       you begin collecting email addresses, the better -- and MailChimp's
       subscription forms are the way to do it.
       MailChimp doesn't begin charging til after you hit 2,000
       subscribers. Even if you're not sending out regular newsletters,
       it's helpful to build your list for when it is time for email
       outreach. Analytics on campaigns will tell you who opened your
       email, what they clicked on and more -- it's great feedback into
       how well you're communicating your product message.
    6. Paper%2520video%2520grab

6. [91]Paper
       Handwriting [92]activates your brain differently than typing. That
       might have something to do with the genius breakthroughs that were
       first scribbled on a napkin.
       Paper is an award-winning iPad app developed by [93]FiftyThree that
       works as an art pad or a journal. It's great for documenting your
       life or just letting loose with some digital-style fingerpainting.
       Check out the [94]company's Tumblr to see what people have created.
    7. E6c2bae3

7. [95]Uber
       Uber is neither app nor traditional service, but blends the two.
       It's a car service with the kind of customer care that wouldn't be
       possible without mobile phones and GPS technology. It attracts
       high-end customers with sleek cars and is branded as a private
       driver rather than a cab service.
       But, the convenience is what draws most people in. No money is
       exchanged with drivers because payments (and tip!) are taken care
       of on Uber's end. Pricing varies with time and distance, and once
       you've dropped a pin to request a car, phone notifications let you
       know how close your driver is. So even if you're standing in the
       rain, you don't feel totally left out in the cold.
    8. Dc42ac64

8. [96]iPad
       Of all gadgets, the iPad is probably the most ubiquitous. It sort
       of works as a [97]laptop replacement (but not if you do a lot of
       coding or design) and is also great for reading blogs or watching
       videos. Best of all, it's slim, which makes it a great companion
       for travel or conference-going.
       Depending on your use case, there are plenty of accessories, like
       keyboards or a stylus, that make the iPad work better for you. Not
       to mention, most entrepreneurs make a habit of staying on top of
       the latest tech product releases -- and many these days are first
       released as an iPad app, so it helps to be able to experience these
       products first-hand.
    9. 27b5fc0d

9. [98]PSP
       When you're hopping on and off planes and trains to meet with
       venture capital firms, you have to travel light. Luckily, a PSP can
       go everywhere with you. It's great for both business trips and just
       taking a break. Because sometimes you need to escape for a little
       bit to rejuvenate your thought process.
   10. Idea%2520paint

10. [99]IdeaPaint
       IdeaPaint is trendy, and for good reason. It turns any surface into
       a white board. Depending on the size wall you decide to transform,
       you get quite a bit of space to draw or mock up ideas. Not
       surprisingly, this makes the process more collaborative. Plus,
       IdeaPaint is cost-effective, compared to purchasing whiteboards for
       the office or home.
       The company recently launched a [100]transparent version, which
       means you can make a dry erase wall without compromising on colors.
