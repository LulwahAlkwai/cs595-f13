Managing Your Advisor

   Posted: August 14, 2013 | Author: [19]Nick Feamster | Filed under:
   [20]advice, [21]management |[22]2 Comments »

   With the new academic term almost upon us, several of my students
   started to put together a list of practical advice for incoming
   students--including various niceties such as how to gain access to the
   lab, how to get accounts, how to submit reimbursements, and so forth.
   I wanted to contribute to the list of advice, and I figured I could
   offer some value by giving advice to new students about how to gain
   traction on their research as quickly as possible.  This post is the
   first in a series of a few posts on that topic; in this post, I will
   cover the topic of managing your advisor.

   The notion of an advisor is an interesting concept for many new Ph.D.
   students.  Incoming graduate students typically have one of two
   backgrounds: some come straight from undergraduate studies (and, hence,
   may have never had a manager or a boss overseeing their career); others
   have spent some time in the workforce and have decided to return to the
   university and begin a career in research (and, hence, have some notion
   of what it is like to have a manager).  An advisor-student relationship
   is unique, though, and will be a new experience for both types of
   incoming students.  The relationship is similar to a manager
   relationship, but has several differentiating features.  First, your
   advisor is often a collaborator on equal footing.  Although an incoming
   Ph.D. student is not (yet) a peer of his or her advisor, the goal is
   that by the end of the Ph.D. process, the student and advisor will be
   peers.  In this sense, the Ph.D. is a true apprenticeship.  My students
   don't work for me; they work with me.  Second, your advisor is not a
   manager in the strict sense, but is literally an advisor: You are in
   control of shaping your own graduate career, from what you choose to
   work on to who you work with.  Your advisor should be a catalyst and
   facilitator for your success and should not be treating you as an
   employee or "hired labor".  Although some research contracts have
   deliverables, you should be suspicious of any advisor who wants to
   constantly hold you to tight deliverables, as it will constrain your
   autonomy and creativity; that type of advisor will ultimately be more
   like a manager, and you can find plenty of managers in industry who
   will pay you a much higher salary.  If you find that your advisor is
   bossing you around or restricting your autonomy or creativity, change
   advisors as soon as possible.

   In any advisor or managerial context, it is important to recognize the
   importance of "managing up".  While there may be strategic reasons to
   do this in any context, the most important reason to learn how to
   manage your advisor is to make the most of your graduate career.  Many
   things compete for your advisor's attention--papers, grants, proposals,
   teaching, committees, other students, outside opportunities, etc.  At
   the same time, everyone's Ph.D. experience is unique, and it is
   incumbent on you to work with your advisor to help you define your own
   trajectory and also to create a working relationship that works for
   both of you.

   In my seven years as an advisor, I have learned a few things about my
   working style.  Here is some of the advice I have offered my students
   about how to manage me.  Many of these tips may be useful in general
   for other Ph.D. students who want to help build a better relationship
   with their advisor and help get the most out of their graduate careers:
     * Ask your advisor for what you need.  Want to attend a conference,
       get an introduction to a senior colleague in the field, buy a book
       or other equipment, find an internship, get a travel grant, or
       something else?  Be proactive.  The answer will be "yes" more often
       than you think .

     * Scheduling meetings. I have a Google calendar that I share with all
       of my students.  If a meeting or event is not on my calendar, the
       student should assume that the meeting is not happening, even if
       the meeting has been discussed (and agreed on!) in the hallway.
       There is no way to keep track of hallway discussions for scheduling
       and they are quickly forgotten.  Though it's not strictly
       necessary, I advise my students to consider sending a
       reminder/minutes/confirmation before the meeting; this relates to
       the point below on making meetings count.  Scheduling meetings
       sometimes can generate an explosion of email--this is a recipe for
       disaster and ensuring that you never get to meet your advisor (see
       below on email); if scheduling is proceeding slowly, limit the
       email thread to 1-2 emails before suggesting a meeting invitation
       by Google calendar.  If all else fails, send a meeting invitation
       during an open slot; in the worst case, your advisor will react by
       moving it to a time that works (it is on the calendar and thus can
       no longer be deferred indefinitely).
     * Try to meet your advisor once a week, even if you think you have
       nothing to talk about.  Make an effort to schedule a meeting once a
       week, even if the meeting is short; in my experience, I have found
       that sometimes even a ten-minute meeting with a student can make a
       huge difference for working around a mental block or changing an
       approach to a problem.  Do not assume that a meeting cannot happen
       simply because your advisor is not in town.  Short meetings by
       Google hangout are often very handy.  In fact, throughout the
       summer of 2013, I was rarely at Georgia Tech; many of my students
       actually found it easier to meet me when I was traveling because I
       wasn't being constantly bombarded by things related to the daily
       drumbeat at the university (e.g., committee meetings, interruptions
       from admins, teaching, etc.).  Consider having a meeting even if
       you think there's nothing to report.  You may find you are stuck in
       a rathole, and you may not even realize it.  You should be
       particularly worried if you have spent 2-3 weeks "debugging" or on
       some "implementation" without getting any feedback.  Chances are,
       you are ratholing on something that probably isn't getting you any
       closer to a publication.  Seek help immediately!
     * Attend every single group meeting.  Do not miss group meetings.
       These are one of the most important structural elements of your
       graduate career that actually relates to your research.  Group
       meetings are important for several reasons: (1) You learn about
       what others in the group are doing, which may be a useful resource
       (or, you may find out you can be a resource to someone else).  This
       all helps with collaborating across the group. (2) You find out
       what your advisor has been up to and why he or she has not been
       replying to your emails immediately. (3) You can quickly identify
       if you need to have a longer meeting with your advisor, with other
       students in the group, etc.  This can be a huge timesaver.  (4)
       Group meetings mark the passage of time.  It is useful to hold
       yourself accountable and make sure that weeks and months don't slip
       away without progress.  I have group meetings with my students
       three times a week; initially, I thought that this might be
       excessive, but it turns out to work pretty well.  Three short group
       meetings can often be a lot better than one extended group meeting.
        I will expand on this more in a later post.

     * If you need more of your advisor's time, ask for it.  Students are
       often confused or concerned that an advisor spends more time with
       some students than with others and may even (wrongly) think that
       the advisor is either less excited about a particular project or
       (worse) doesn't like some students as much as others.  (I remember
       comparing notes with my fellow Ph.D. students in grad school about
       how much time our advisor was spending with each of us.)  Yet, it
       is important to remember that good advisors don't play favorites.
       The time that an advisor spends with a student (or on a project) is
       typically determined by the advisor's perception of how much time
       is needed; the required time can vary dramatically according to
       both the stage of the project and the stage of the student's
       development.  Students who are early in their careers typically
       need (and should be asking for) a lot of guidance and "closed loop"
       feedback.  Students who are close to graduating also tend to need
       more attention of a different sort--help with building their
       professional network, seeking out job prospects, practicing job
       talks, and generally landing on their feet.  Similarly, nascent
       research projects or projects with substantial coordination
       components (e.g., large systems-building efforts) often need a lot
       of advisor attention, since they have lots of moving parts and can
       involve coordination between multiple sub-projects and students. Do
       not be overly concerned about strict time accounting.  If you feel
       you need more time, simply ask for it--or, better yet, just try to
       take more time (walk into your advisor's office, approach him or
       her on IM, send regular email updates...whatever it takes).
       Advisors tend to spend more time with students who demand more of
       their time.

     * Keep your emails short and to the point.  Here is a simple rule of
       thumb: If the email is longer than one paragraph, it probably won't
       get read right away, particularly if there is no summary at the
       beginning of it.  It almost certainly won't get an immediate
       response.  Additionally, consider whether email is the fastest way
       to resolve something, or whether it's quicker to have a 5-10 minute
       meeting, hangout, IM chat, phone call, or whatever.  Use the right
       communication mode for the job.
     * Do not assume that if your email doesn't get a reply, it hasn't
       been read.  I read everything in my inbox, almost always on the
       same day that it arrives.  Unfortunately, I also receive 300-500
       emails per day in my inbox (not mailing lists), many of which are
       actionable.  Suppose that half of those emails required action, and
       that each one required one minute to process and respond to--that's
       already six or seven hours a day just to process email.  That is
       insane and can kill anyone's productivity.  I am convinced that it
       is possible for a professor to do nothing else in life except reply
       to email.  To control this insanity, I often process emails "in
       batch mode"--leaving email to (mostly) pile up for a few days and
       then responding to a bunch at once.  I tell my students that if
       they do not receive a reply right away, "retransmission" after a
       few days is fine. I do not consider this to be rude, nagging, or
       pestering behavior; most likely I have simply just forgotten (I
       have found that it's surprisingly difficult to even keep a to do
       list for all of these things that students ask professors to do, as
       doing so becomes a monster mega-task in and of itself).  Before
       sending a retransmission (or initial email), however, consider
       whether you have chosen the best medium for your message. Sometimes
       an in-person meeting or IM follow up to a an email will get the
       response you want/need.
     * Make the meetings count.  Many meetings are wasted by not asking
       yourself simple "does this make sense?" questions before presenting
       a plot/result.  I ask my students to read Jon Bentley's
       "[23]Programming Pearls", particularly [24]the chapter on back of
       the envelope calculations.  Also, I advise my students to read Vern
       Paxson's "[25]Strategies for Sound Internet Measurement". Your
       advisor has almost certainly seen a ton of plots/experiments/data
       and is pretty good at quickly determining whether a graph that you
       spent two days producing makes any sense at all.  You can have a
       more productive meeting if you do some simple debugging of plots
       before hand.  On this note, bringing specific, concrete things that
       your advisor can react to is helpful.  "I ran some experiments and
       things seem to look OK." is a report I have heard many times from
       students.  Such a report is utterly useless.  Even if it were true
       (often things may not be OK), it is impossible to give feedback on
       or brainstorm based on vague statements.  You are likely to get a
       "sounds good!" in response, which is equally useless for you.
       Bring something concrete to discuss.  You can present anything: A
       performance number, a paragraph of writing, a plot, ... something
       to react to and figure out next steps.  Even a plot that appears
       buggy or inexplicable is sometimes a good topic for a meeting, too,
       presuming you've recognized the discrepancies and can't figure out
       the problem.  Sometimes what appears to be a bug might in fact be
       an interesting artifact, or even the spark for a new paper or
       discovery.
     * Take notes and organize them. The students who make the best use of
       meetings tend to have: (1) an agenda beforehand; (2) minutes
       afterwards; (3) something focused and concrete to discuss/think
       about/talk about; (4) a consolidated place to keep minutes.  Your
       advisor can read these minutes to prepare for the upcoming meeting,
       think about problems offline, review/think about the problem
       outside of meetings, and guide progress.  Sometimes your advisor
       may take notes, sometimes not.  Don't count on it.  Even if your
       advisor is taking notes, your notes will complement and fill in
       gaps.  Different people remember different things.  Taking notes is
       also an important opportunity to practice writing--and students
       need to practice writing at every opportunity (more on that in a
       later post).
     * Do not wait until the last minute to write your paper.  Most
       graduate students are working on one or at most two papers or
       projects at any given time.  It can thus be easy to overlook the
       fact  that your advisor is involved in many more things (albeit at
       a higher level) and, from a purely practical standpoint, might be
       submitting two or three papers to the same conference
       deadline. Thus, waiting until the last minute to write a paper
       draft (or complete a project) is an invitation for scattered,
       distracted, and superficial feedback (and severely diminished
       chances of a strong paper submission).   Can you write a good paper
       or think clearly while doing four things at once?  If not, consider
       your poor advisor, whose aging brain is no longer as agile as
       yours.  Write early, write often.  Writing is not a task that
       happens after the research is done; rather, it is part of the
       research and thinking process, not something that is done when the
       research is done.  Writing is part of the research.  I ask my
       students to have a complete paper draft at least one week before
       the deadline.  Nobody ever follows this advice, and I think that we
       can recognize that it is idealistic.  I've periodically threatened
       to ban paper submissions if there is no draft a week before; I
       don't have the will to do that, although I know at least one of my
       collaborators who enforces this rule.  Still, the point remains:
       early attention == focused attention == good attention.
     * Do not ask for a recommendation letter with less than one week's
       notice.  A letter takes at least an hour to write--longer if there
       is no earlier draft from another instance.  Short notice makes for
       letters that will probably not be as strong as they could be,
       because a good letter takes time to polish.  Consider writing the
       first draft yourself, or at least putting some points into bullet
       form or providing an up-to-date CV, for quick reference.  All of
       this stuff makes the letter stronger and easier to write.

   This list is mostly based on tips and tricks that I have found work for
   me.  I refined this list of advice after a discussion with
   [26]Professor Jennifer Rexford, who is also [27]full of useful advice.
    Jen's [28]advice for new graduate students is particularly useful; I
   am in strong agreement with her thoughts on the benefits of regularly
   coming to the lab and integrating with a research group.  I'm
   interested to hear what other tips and tricks people have for managing
   their advisor(s), or thoughts from other faculty members about tips
   they find that work well.  In the coming weeks and months, I will
   follow up with specific posts on advice for writing, preparing talks,
   and managing time.
