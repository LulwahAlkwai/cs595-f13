   [48]Instagram has become one of the web's most popular platforms for
   photo and video sharing. To help users integrate the social network
   even further into their daily lives, it has released a public
   application programming interface (API).

   For those who have never heard the term before, an API is a seamless
   software-to-software interface, meaning there is no user involvement
   during the passing of information. For example, when you enter credit
   card information to make an online purchase, the website sends your
   credit card information through an API to another application, which
   confirms that the provided information is correct.

   By using [50]Instagram's public API, users -- tech-savvy or otherwise
   -- have a number of options on how to best implement the code. For some
   ideas on how to begin, here are eight basic ways to use the API for
   your own online presence.

1. Search Tags

   The ability to search through and pull images from specific hashtags is
   one of the most basic functions of the Instagram API. Many [51]apps and
   services that use Instagram API, some of which will be discussed
   further down the list, rely heavily on this operation.

   Searching tags and having them update in real time on a website can be
   useful for many things, including marketing campaigns. Musician Moby
   [52]used the API for a fan project about towns after dark, in which
   every picture with the tag #destroyed showed up on an interactive map.

   Here's a [53]quick tutorial on how to pull tags from the API.

2. Incorporate Photos on Websites

   The most obvious use of the API is to post Instagram photos or a
   photostream on a personal or business website. The photos can come from
   a specific Instagram account, or from tags created by other users. With
   this function, users can create a gallery of images or have the
   photostream automatically update as new pictures are added.

   There are many websites that pull users' photostreams so they can be
   viewed in their entireties online, such as [54]Followgram. If you want
   to try programming it yourself, check out [55]this tutorial.

3. View Photos from Specific Locations in Real Time

   Have you ever wondered what kinds of pictures Seattle residents are
   posting? Want to see what London-based users are uploading to
   Instagram? Curious to see photos and video from a Japanese summer
   festival?

   By using Instagram's API to search for geotags, users can see updates
   from around the world in real time. This function comes in handy when
   you want to see trends in different countries, watch big events
   happening across the globe or simply to admire the beauty of a
   different landscape.

   Here's a [57]how-to guide to get you started.

4. View Popular and Trending Photos

   Another useful feature allows users to pull the most popular or
   trending photos from Instagram. This works well for companies that want
   to see if any products are particularly popular among Instagram users.
   It is also a valuable tool for data analysis, to see what types of
   photos do well or which users are especially popular. Of course, people
   can also use this feature to view the most popular posts of the day.

   If you want to showcase Instagram's most popular photos of the day on
   your site, [58]here's an easy method you can use.

5. Print Photos from Events and Tags Instantly

   If you have a fondness for old instant film cameras, Instagram's API
   can help. Through the API, it's possible to print any photo you upload
   to your feed instantly from your smartphone. All a user has to do is
   set the API to print pictures taken with a specific hashtag or from
   their feed.

   For example, if you want to make a printed collage of the beautiful
   sunrises you capture, you would set the API to search for the tag
   #beautifulsunrises in your own stream and then set it to print those
   images once you add them.

   If this sounds too intense programming-wise, you can use services such
   as [59]Instaprint .

6. Make Custom Items

   Thanks to the API, it is now possible to put your favorite shots on
   phone cases, mugs, postcards and more. Since the API allows you to pull
   entire photo feeds, users can take the images to make any number of
   custom-decorated items in their own home, or order them from
   specialized companies.

   If you'd like to purchase an iPhone case like the one shown above, you
   can get one at [61]Casetagram. Other customizable items are available
   from [62]select services.

7. Market Venues, Events and Businesses

   Using the Instagram API to pull photos with hashtags and geotags has
   proven to be a lucrative tool for local businesses and venues. By
   pulling pictures from specific brand or tags, business owners can see
   how their products are being used and whether they're popular. Venue
   owners can also find photos that show customers enjoying events at
   their locales.

   Instagram's API has even been used as a [63]marketing tool to sell
   products. Brisk, a beverage company, asked its customers to tag photos
   with #brisk and selected their favorites to put on limited edition
   cans.

   There are services which also pull photos for information on products
   and events. [64]Now is an app that pulls information from Instagram
   photo as well as other sources to show upcoming events and hot-spots.
   [65]Venueseen works with brands and companies to help with their
   Instagram presence.

8. Create Event Live Feeds

   Most social networks are conducive to live feeding an event -- in fact,
   it's one of the major functions of [66]Twitter. With the Instagram API,
   event organizers can pull photos with event-specific tags and display
   them onscreen in real time. The Black Eyed Peas [67]used it during a
   concert in Manhattan's Central Park to showcase fan photos taken during
   the performance.

   If you are planning an event and want an Instagram live feed, but you
   want to avoid the hassle of coding, you can use [68]Eventstagram or any
   number of other online services.
