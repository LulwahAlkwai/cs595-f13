   The Tesla S Isn't a Car, It's a Rolling Tablet. And that's a great
   thing!
   I think the Tesla is an embarrassment to the car industry because it
   showcases how cars should be built but generally aren't. Basically Musk
   took many of the aspects of a good Apple product and build a car out of
   the concept and ended up with something that can be faster, safer, and
   more fuel efficient than any other car on the road. Basically the Tesla
   S is a rolling iPad and I'm starting to wonder if Elon Musk is going to
   become, or already is, our new Steve Jobs. This is my column on
   ShadowTrends this week:
