Kripke Legend Award</strong></a> for her work in promoting women in science.</p>
<p>Hopkins is probably most well known for having <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire/?page=full"><strong>walked out of</strong></a> a lecture by Harvard University President Larry Summers in 2005, when he asserted that men may be genetically more predisposed to science than women. Hopkins couldn&#8217;t stomach that after spending much of her career trying to equalize opportunities in science for women.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Hopkins was also inspired by, and worked for James Watson during her career. Not surprisingly, she turned out to be a great interview. Here, then, is a transcript of our discussion:</p>
<p><strong>As of today how would you characterize the playing field for women in science? Is it level yet?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s better than it used to be. There’s been a lot of progress but we’re not quite there yet. There’s a lot of understanding of the issues and much more progress in how to address them that’s been done at many universities. But I think it’s probably going to take another 10 or 15 years, with these kinds of efforts, to get there.</p>

(Sam Ogden)</p></div>
<p><strong>What sorts of issues have you had to address over the years?</strong></p>
<p>Before the mid-1960s women really couldn’t get jobs on university faculties, and not many women went into science and engineering. So it really was civil rights and affirmative action in the late 1960s and early 1970s that opened the doors of universities in the United States so women could get in. Then the women’s movement, Sputnik, and many things happened that pushed more women into science. The pipeline began to grow and people thought that’s all it would take. They thought time alone was going to solve this problem.</p>
<p>But what we learned is that time alone did not solve it. Even after you let the women in there were these invisible barriers that kept them from rising to the top. So a generation of women had to get through the system and identify what the problems were, and then partner with institutions to find institutional solutions to those problems. For example, going way back, the first problem they encountered was sexual harassment. Whoever imagined such a problem? It took 10 years to figure it out and make a law prohibiting it in workplaces.</p>
<p>Generally when you identify a problem it takes about 30 years to first identify, devise solutions, test the solutions and then make sure everyone learns about it. Then there was a lack of mentors. And then there was the one we worked on at MIT, the undervaluation of women for equal work. This is now called unconscious bias. We’re about 15 years in on that one. I think the remaining problem is the one that we did know about early on, but never really addressed, and that is family issues. How do you get people to very high level positions, and make it possible for both men and women to have families?</p>
<p><strong>How can the problem of needing time to raise a family be addressed?</strong></p>
<p>When I started most women like myself chose not to have children if they were going to do this job, and that was my choice. I was divorced when I was 30, and I chose science. You knew there was no solution. How could you work these enormous hours and yet still have a family? When we started working on this issue at MIT, in 1995, no woman had ever taken a family leave and gotten tenure in science. Women didn’t even discuss it because the stigma was so great. At that time if a woman had a child she kept it secret because it might damage her professional career. But it turns out women can have children if you just helped them a little bit. You need to make family friendly policies and take the stigma out of it. Fairly simple things made an enormous difference. The big thing was you could talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>I note you worked in the lab of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Watson">James Watson</a> as a fellow, and he certainly has had interesting relationships with women. Did that experience change you in regard to women in science?</strong></p>
<p>You probably don’t realize what an interesting question that is. I actually went into science because I heard Jim give a lecture when I was an undergraduate student. I fell madly in love with molecular biology in one hour. I ended up working in his lab as an undergraduate, and it was he who told me to go to graduate school. I didn’t particularly want to get a Ph.D., I just wanted to do another experiment. The idea, of my generation of women going into science, was really remote from anything I’d ever imagined. But he really pushed me to go to graduate school. That was the time when the doors of universities had just opened. Suddenly, with the affirmative action laws, I was offered a job at MIT and Harvard. He was hugely supportive of me during that era.</p>
<p>However, he was not as supportive later on when I took this issue on visibly. He was not supportive of my efforts to take up the cause of women. I’m not exactly sure why. At the time, when I was young, I think we all bought into the notion that science took 70, 80 or 90 hours a week, and how could you ever be a mother with those hours? Initially I thought that was the only problem, and that if you didn’t have children there would be no problem. But what I learned as I went through my years of being a scientist is there were additional barriers that prevented women from being accepted fully into the profession. I think Jim never really came to agree with that, or believe it, and it bothered him that I had spoken out on that issue.</p>
<p><strong>I recently <a href="http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2012/02/one-of-nasas-top-planet-hunters-talks-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-kepler/">did an interview</a> with the successful astrophysicist Natalie Batalha, who told me that as a young woman scientist she found herself constantly underestimating her abilities. Is this fairly common among women scientists?</strong></p>
<p>We do see it even today in our students, and we don’t understand it. We see women students who have less confidence in our male students. Even when women are doing better, and we hear this from many professors, they come to their teachers with concerns about their grades. But men, let’s say they’re getting a C or failing, talk about how they’re going to master the material. So there’s a difference in confidence level. What’s really important is an emergence of understanding that both men and women undervalue work if it’s done by a woman. So there’s this bias. So yes, women are battling this, and it’s a real phenomenon that’s been documented in studies.</p>
<p><strong>Have you spoken to Larry Summers much since the 2005 lecture he gave?</strong></p>
<p>Only through the press. Actually, after the original event we did have a communication or two. I got a lot of hate mail, and one of them was a fake e-mail that appeared to come from Larry Summers, telling me what he thought of me in no uncertain terms. So I shipped it over to some of my pals at Harvard, thinking it probably was a fake, which it was, and he wrote me back an apologized for what was happening. I suggested we write an article or give a talk and explain why the comments he made were factually wrong, why there’s no genetic evidence for any group of people to be inferior to others in abilities relevant in science and engineering. He said he would think about it, but I’m still waiting to hear back. That was six years ago so I don’t think he’s going to call soon.</p>
<p><strong>More women today are getting college degrees than men. Do you envision a day when there are more scientists who are women than men?</strong></p>
<p>The only field of science and engineering in which there are more women than men, in the undergraduate years, is biology. Conversely, if you look at the science and engineering faculty at MIT today, it’s 18 percent women. You look at the engineering faculty, it’s 16 percent. A huge national problem is the failure of women to go into engineering, which is contributing hugely to the shortage of engineers in this country. So women are unlikely to take over any time soon. I do worry very much about those numbers shifting. I worry about why more women than men are going to college, and I’m concerned about more women than men in biology. But those numbers aren’t yet translating up to the top. You still see a tremendous underrepresentation of women at the top. So you’ve got to worry about the bottom, where it’s shifting, and you’ve got to worry about the top, where it isn’t shifting.</p>
<p><strong>You’re worried about fewer men going into science in college, at least in biology?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it bothers me a lot. Why is it happening? We need to understand this.</p>

This has to be the most biased interview I have seen this year.<br />
I have seen a test grade go from an 84 to a 90 when a<br />
girl rubbed her chest up against a teacher&#8217;s back and<br />
field trips with 2 people in a professor&#8217;s sleeping bag.<br />
I have heard a professor admit that female crotch exposure was<br />
so common in his class that he did not focus past the edge<br />
of his lectern during his whole lecture, and I have seen lab assistant<br />
positions lead directly to an Mrs.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment and all that other stuff are too often just games women<br />
play to seek an advantage.</p>
<p>I have known and respected a few female students and scientists where this was not the norm, but to act like the female student is not as much a player in the game<br />
is unconscionable.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Excellent interview with an interesting and inspiring person.  Remembering my own experiences with female geoscientists in all careers during the mid-70s to mid-90s, so much changed and it seems today over half are women when there were few in the &#8217;60s.  And my wife&#8217;s experiences with CPAs and the Big 8 (now Big 4) accounting firms in the 70s to &#8217;90s is very similar to Dr. Hopkins&#8217; experience.  It is good women like this take on the battle in their fields, so many have and the results show today.  I am proud she helped out one of my alma maters too, MIT really needed help in this regard many years ago, and even though not where it should be in science and engineering, progress is being made and other areas are much better and are close to being there.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>To answer the last question: Because there&#8217;s more money to be made in other fields. With so many people taking out student loans (and needing to pay them back) they&#8217;re going to select fields with bigger paychecks. Adding to that, what about the number of available positions? There are more jobs out there for engineers than biologists.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve definitely named one of the primary factors, but it should apply to women as well as men. In my case, I could work as a planetologist for $60,000/year (if I&#8217;m lucky) or in <a HREF="http://www.careersinoilandgas.com/working-in-oil-gas-/pay-and-benefits-in-oil-and-gas-/pay-salary-information-.aspx" rel="nofollow">the oil and gas industry for more than twice that</a>. The science is the same (for the most part), and I get to work on projects that don&#8217;t take twenty years to get built.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Obviously (or maybe not, given one&#8217;s point of view) women like this should not have to choose between contributing to science and having kids. Not only do these women deserve both, if they so choose, but we as a species need those genes circulating freely in the pool.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I sure hope that statistician extraordinaire JohnD is available to comment on this post and what I&#8217;m going to say below in response to it, because we sure as heck could use his expertise on this.   </p>
<p>JohnD, correct me if I&#8217;m misunderstanding the 2005 events referenced above, but Larry Summers was demonized in the press and sacrificed on the altar of political correctness for simply stating (or at least shrewdly inferring) a scientific observation that has NOT been disproven, that very well may NEVER be disproven, and that is consistent with my personal qualitative observations over many years of intensive academic competition:  the standard deviation of men&#8217;s intelligence might be as much as 20 percent greater than that of women&#8217;s intelligence.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, Larry Summers NEVER claimed that men were &#8220;smarter&#8221; than women or &#8220;more capable&#8221;.  He simply said that the TAILS of the IQ distribution appear to be different (an observation that has been supported by studies not connected to him), and that those differences are potentially enough to explain why there are more men in the top academic echelons of STEM fields than women (one reference:  Ian Ayers, &#8220;Super Crunchers&#8221;, see pp. 225-230 in the 2007 paperback edition).  </p>
<p>It is EXTREMELY important to be as clear as possible on the FACTS of this issue irrespective of personal reactions to those facts, and irrespective of any ameliorating policies that may subsequently be applied in response to those facts in order to maximize any defined socioeconomic outcome.  I&#8217;m not gearing up here to argue that a status quo of preferring men to women in the STEM fields is preferable because there are numerous genuine indirect and intangible benefits that can be derived from promoting gender equality in higher education.  I&#8217;m just talking about the raw statistics and how we deal with them both individually (as women) and collectively.  </p>
<p>If we ignore or disavow the statistics that Summers referenced, we disavow the scientific method in its entirety.  With that kind of mentality, we might as well start doing rain dances the next time we get hit with a drought interval.  </p>
<p>Disavowing reality is never in the best interest of anyone.  Let&#8217;s accept for the moment that the spread of men&#8217;s IQ really *IS* 20% greater than that of women.  Let&#8217;s accept that for the sake of argument because, to my knowledge, it has been roughly measured as such in some studies, and not subsequently been disproven by other studies.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best recourse for women scientists and women STEM students in the face of that statistic?  Is their best course of action to get all huffy and &#8220;walk out&#8221; every time they hear that statistic stated?   To such women I would say &#8211; way to play right into the age-old histrionic female stereotype, gals.  Do you think that you&#8217;re doing women in science a FAVOR by acting that way?  You might get some immediate ego-traction in the &#8220;if it bleeds it leads&#8221; press, and you might get traction in the simple-minded court of public opinion but, in the LONG run, if you disavow the very scientific process the virtues of which you so passionately claim to extol, you&#8217;re going to lose, and you&#8217;ll drag every other woman in science down with you.  </p>
<p>And worst of all, if you behave that way, you&#8217;ll miss the opportunity to understand where your REAL power lies, and where your REAL potential for advancement in STEM is to be found: in the very physiological differences that created those statistical IQ tail distinctions in the first place.  The *average* IQs of men and women may not be different (a fact that Summers also apparently noted), but the male and female brains ARE different by design.  In vernacular terms, men do certain things better than women, and women do certain things better than men.  By embracing rather than denying the 20%-ish statistical tails difference in IQ, we can then move forward to identify and leverage those areas where WOMEN have THEIR respective 20%-ish advantages.  </p>
<p>And those feminine advantages DO exist.  Allow me to illustrate it by telling my particular story, as a female scientist.  </p>
<p>I set a goal for myself within one week of entering university as an undergrad: at graduation, I would take that institution&#8217;s top medal in my field of scientific study.  </p>
<p>The competition was one hell of a lot tougher than I expected it to be.  I was accustomed to being &#8220;smarter&#8221; than most people, but what I didn&#8217;t expect was to have to admit to myself that there were two men in that program who were simply smarter than I was.  I could not for the life of me understand how they were able to do what they did &#8211; the workings of their brains were simply beyond my reach.  I scrutinized those guys DAILY, for four long years! &#8211; the careful (OK, obsessive) study of their methods was part of my overall competitive strategy.  And they were simply smarter, every step of the way.  </p>
<p>&#8211; BUT &#8212; </p>
<p>Acknowledging their superiority in that one isolated area (raw intelligence) also allowed me to recognize those areas where those men were NOT as capable as I was, and there proved to be two of them:</p>
<p>(1) They did NOT have eyes in the backs of their heads, the way I did.  Any construct that they got hold of intellectually, they would thrash me on.  But simultaneously, they missed a lot more than I did.  Women evolved to ensure that no toddler under their care wanders into a creek and drowns or eats poison berries when nobody is watching.  So women watch.  They watch EVERYTHING.  Women are more finely calibrated to let no observation elude their awareness, no matter how subtle.  This is a powerful advantage that can be re-directed and leveraged in the STEM fields.  If you&#8217;re a really smart guy but you only register 93% of the constructs to which you are exposed, you&#8217;re going to be out-done by the woman who maybe does not grasp them quite as deeply as you do, but who grasps all 100% of them including that 7% that you utterly failed to even notice let alone master. </p>
<p>(2) Those men were simply not capable of communicating as thoroughly as I could.  If you are a guy who understands 100% of some scientific thing but are only able to clearly explain 90% of it, you will be un-done by the female who understands 95% of that thing but is correspondingly able to explain 100% of that 95%.</p>
<p>My academic competition was so severe that, if I had let my guard down for EVEN ONE DAY in those entire four years, I would have lost that medal.  The competition was so intense that if I had failed to admit REALITY to myself (that the men were smarter), I would *never* have been able to identify my own competitive advantages.  The rest is personal history: as far as the professors could determine from the available institutional records, I was only the second female student ever to win that particular medal for achievement in science, in a post-secondary institution that has figured prominently in the advancement of science since its inception in the mid-19th century.  </p>
<p>If women are truly motivated to succeed in the STEM fields, they&#8217;ll find the reality in this whole IQ fracas, and then they&#8217;ll build from there.  They won&#8217;t win (in fact, they won&#8217;t even gain real confidence in themselves) via the routes of power-posturing and playing gender cards.  I very much look forward to seeing future studies that further elucidate the differences in male and female IQ distributions.  I only hope that the topic is not so politically incorrect that nobody is able to touch it, because that would be a tremendous loss for all of us.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a link to what he actually said:<br />
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html</a></p>
<p>He never provided any hard-and-fast numbers in his speech; he merely stated that he thought that men outnumbered women by five to one at the highest levels of the field. He misquoted <a HREF="http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/abs/1668" rel="nofollow">XIe and Schauman</a> in support of his allegations, and misused the statistics to support it. Basically, what he did was the equivalent to saying that people in the 1930s were shorter on average than people in the 1990s and therefore people in the 1930s couldn&#8217;t be as tall as people in the 1990s. The error in that should be obvious.</p>
<p>He also derided the fairly well-accepted hypothesis that one reason that women are under-represented is because they are typically given lesser and lower posts to start with based on the assumption that they&#8217;ll just quit in a few years to go home and have babies so why waste a tenured position on them? (NB: Not my position on this, but a <a HREF="http://www.aauw.org/learn/research/whysofew.cfm" rel="nofollow">well-documented bias in the field</a>.) What he fails to understand is that academic rank is much like compound interest; if you are given a little more to start with, you end up with much more at the end of your career.</p>
<p>And he also tries to make a case for a purely laissez-faire solution, expecting that universities will try to pick up female scientists on the bargain rack (as it were), given that there is not a strong market demand for them (&#8220;If it was really the case that everybody was discriminating, there would be very substantial opportunities for a limited number of people who were not prepared to discriminate to assemble remarkable departments of high quality people at relatively limited cost simply by the act of their not discriminating, because of what it would mean for the pool that was available.&#8221;) As anyone who remembers the 1950s (or their history) can attest, that solution is non-tenable.</p>
<p>All in all, his speech was ethically, scientifically, and morally repugnant.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I&#8217;m sorry, Alisonymous, there was one other point that I meant to address:</p>
<p><i>Disavowing reality is never in the best interest of anyone. Let’s accept for the moment that the spread of men’s IQ really *IS* 20% greater than that of women. Let’s accept that for the sake of argument because, to my knowledge, it has been roughly measured as such in some studies, and not subsequently been disproven by other studies.</i></p>
<p>The truth is that IQ is a very shaky predictor of future success. Many surveys have shown that <a HREF="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20628656?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=55949950943" rel="nofollow">the correlation of IQ to success</a> is moderate at best, with many other factors (environment, opportunities, self-worth) playing large parts as well. Indeed, some have posited that the main predictor of success is not IQ <i>per se</i> but <a HREF="http://www.sharpbrains.com/blog/2010/01/10/working-memory-a-better-predictor-of-academic-success-than-iq/" rel="nofollow">the ability to use that IQ via &#8220;working memory&#8221;</a> (think of it as being the difference between the disk drive {IQ} and the processor {working memory} on a computer; a huge disk drive does you little good if your processor is too small or slow). </p>
<p>Of course, as is always the case with human research, the results are controversial. But the bottom line is not, and echoes what Dr. Hopkins said above &#8211; it isn&#8217;t nature or nurture; it is both.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I re-read his speech and I don&#8217;t find it &#8220;morally repugnant&#8221;.  Moral repugnance is a subjective experience, and as such is a manifestation of:<br />
(1) the ego (as ego as defined strictly in terms of &#8216;the self&#8217; without undue weighting of the self-esteem component of the self, which is what tends to happen when the term is used in common American speech).  If there&#8217;s one place where ego absolutely does not belong, it&#8217;s in science.<br />
(2) social tradition, which is mostly arbitrary and often antithetical to science.  </p>
<p>Even so, ego and subjective responses to tradition can both be useful in stimulating science even as both must be vacated for the resulting science to be valid:  simply put, if something really p*sses you off on a personal level, it might serve as an inspiration for investigating that issue in a scientific context.</p>
<p>Not only do I NOT find Summers&#8217; discourse to be morally repugnant, I was actually struck by the extent to which he assumed it would generate additional inquiry &#8212; which is the entire point of academic discourse!  &#8220;I will have served my purpose if I have provoked thought on this question and provoked the marshalling of evidence to contradict what I have said,&#8221; he included in his closing remarks. </p>
<p>The question remains:  has anyone actually used his galvanic discourse to marshal any evidence to contradict what he said?  Or did they all just stomp around huffing their repugnance and leave it at that?  </p>
<p>Ayres gave it a preliminary shot and declared the following, among other things:  &#8220;I&#8217;ve recalculated Summers&#8217;s estimates, using his same methodology, and his bottom-line characterization of the results, if anything, was understated.&#8221;  Ayres also referenced other studies (other than Xle) that found that different IQ standard deviations do, in fact, exist (and if you parse Ayres, you&#8217;ll find that he&#8217;s no lightweight).  He did not reference A LOT of other studies and, at this point, only Ayres knows the reason for that, but I suspect that A LOT of other studies have NOT yet been done because if they had been, this question would be better illuminated by this time.</p>
<p>JohnD, you went into an analysis of Summers&#8217; speech when in fact my point was to ask you if you had any input on the standalone existence of statistics for or against, because you have proven that statistical analysis is one of your fortes.  I was interested in JUST the statistics.  Forget about the contributing factors WHY a standard deviation difference may exist &#8211; everyone realizes that the forcings on the size of the sigma may be varied and may include much more than just chromosomal influences.  For the purposes of immediate analysis, it does not matter WHY those differences exist, and for this analysis it doesn&#8217;t matter what society ultimately does in RESPONSE to them &#8211; it only matters WHETHER differences exist.  </p>
<p>And from the limited direct plus circumstantial evidence I see before me right now, it appears that such differences very well might exist.  I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s more profoundly telling &#8211; the fact that those differences exist based on what we know right now, or the fact that only a few of us (me and Ian Ayres, at least) appear to be willing to talk about THE NUMBERS (as opposed to our personal FEELINGS about those numbers) straight up.  On this very blog, a whole big headlining stink was made a few months ago over the fact that John B. Anderson was &#8220;muzzled&#8221; by TCEQ when he tried to make climate change statements (in fact, the truth of that event was infinitely more nuanced than that, but let me not get into that tangent).  So where is the analogous reaction to what happened to Summers?  Sure, the guy was a bit obnoxious and his political skills were clearly not up-to-task, given his position.  But if being obnoxious were a crime, society would have seen to it that MY jaws were permanently wired shut almost half a century ago.  It is often only WHEN people are intentionally obnoxious that others get galvanized into resolving questions such as this, resolving them one way or the other so that the moving-forward into new realms of awareness can then begin.  </p>
<p>Objectively speaking, both Larry Summers and John B. Anderson were effectively shut down.  But the official version seems to read more toward the conclusion that John B. Anderson was muzzled while Larry Summers was simply dismissed.  I find that deeply troubling.    </p>
<p>In sum, the lady interviewed in this blog post walked out of a presentation in which this question of IQ distributions was raised.  Did she actually contribute anything to the specific scientific dialog besides her own righteous indignation?  Did her subjective reaction inspire her to commence controlled studies to confirm or deny the existence of what got her so p*ssed off in the first place??  Or did she at least make an effort to investigate the presence or absence of third-party controlled studies in the literature and report back on the results of same?  Not that I can discern.  </p>
<p>We conspire to validate conversation-stoppers in this society when those conversation-stoppers serve our ego interests, even as we call ourselves &#8216;scientists&#8217;.  We give them achievement awards. And we hold them up as performance models without fact-checking what they say (e.g., I don&#8217;t know where she got this gross generalization that women scientists with babies did not get tenure twenty years ago&#8230; I began my post-secondary education THIRTY years ago under the direct supervision of two female scientists who both handily got tenure &#8211; absolute intellectual powerhouses they were &#8211; and both had babies.  One had two babies and the other had three babies!!).  How are women in science served by ANY of this?!  How is ANYONE served by any of this?! </p>
<p>There&#8217;s far more that could be said and that NEEDS to be said on this topic, but because of the unfortunate weekend timing of the blog publication, it&#8217;s in the process of being OBE, so I&#8217;ll stop here.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>The question remains: has anyone actually used his galvanic discourse to marshal any evidence to contradict what he said? Or did they all just stomp around huffing their repugnance and leave it at that?</i></p>
<p>See the references that I provided. Not only were his points refuted, they had been refuted numerous times <i>before</i> he spoke. His speech showed that he was at least a decade behind the times in terms of both research and actual progress. That&#8217;s why I found it scientifically repugnant.</p>
<p><i>Ayres gave it a preliminary shot and declared the following, among other things</i></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read Ayers, but the <a HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Leonhardt-t.html?_r=2&amp;ref=review&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">critical reviews of his work are not promising</a>. The most telling part is that he has published his stuff as a popular book (with no peer review) instead of as papers (with peer review). I am also somewhat worried by his apparent insistence that you don&#8217;t need any theory, just piles and piles of data. That is an obsolete form of inquiry that presumes (1) that you know what questions to ask and (2) that the answers are actually in the data. (For the record, I have created similar programs for oil companies to help highlight prospects, but they incorporate a strong dose of geophysical knowledge.)</p>
<p><i>I suspect that A LOT of other studies have NOT yet been done because if they had been, this question would be better illuminated by this time.</i></p>
<p>You&#8217;d lose that bet. IQ and its variations among populations is a perennial favorite research topic. Heck, it is even fundamental to several NSF research areas. The problem is that IQ is poorly defined, hard to measure, and not as deterministic as many would claim.</p>
<p><i>JohnD, you went into an analysis of Summers’ speech when in fact my point was to ask you if you had any input on the standalone existence of statistics for or against, because you have proven that statistical analysis is one of your fortes.</i></p>
<p>Sorry, my misunderstanding. His use of statistics was wrong and he provided no support for his statistics. He took one place on the curve (two sigma) and extrapolated it out without knowing what the true relationship was (he admitted this in the talk). That&#8217;s like saying that because most people drive faster than 50 on the highway, there must be a lot of people who drive faster than 100 (excluding me, of course&#8230;).</p>
<p>Equally wrong was how he used the statistics. As I noted above, he said that because he thought that there were fewer women than men at the top of the field, there <i>had to be</i> fewer women than men at the top of the field. That is neither proper statistics nor proper science.</p>
<p>Let me expand on my counter-example a bit to show you why. It is well known that <a HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.1330290114/abstract" rel="nofollow">the average height of American males has risen by an inch over the past century</a>. Thus, if you were to make histograms of the heights for &#8220;the Greatest Generation&#8221; and for &#8220;Millenials&#8221;, you would see a distinct shift in the peak. In addition, you would find that there were proportionally more Millenials who were over 6&#8242; than there were Greatest Generationals. </p>
<p>Is this difference because the members of the Greatest Generation couldn&#8217;t grow that tall? No. By and large, it was because nutrition and medicine have improved over the past century, allowing the Millenials to come closer to reaching their maximum potential, height-wise. This is also seen in the data; the difference between Millenials and Boomers is almost zero, which is to be expected given that both generations were raised in an era of plentiful nutrition and high quality medical care.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s think about Summer&#8217;s statements. He claims that simply because there are fewer women with a high IQ, women must necessarily be less intelligent than men and therefore less suited to science. But we know that IQ is not a strong determiner of success in science, so his argument fails on that point. We also know that <a HREF="http://ldx.sagepub.com/content/36/1/4.short" rel="nofollow">IQ tests show strong gender biases</a>, which means that the metric is erroneous. Finally, we know that <a HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1993.tb02896.x/abstract" rel="nofollow">IQ is strongly influenced by social and family factors</a>. Thus, given that there are social factors which tend to drive female IQ downward (e.g., the old Dorothy Parker quote about women and glasses), his argument fails again as women are not inherently less intelligent than men (just as GGs are not inherently shorter than Ms). </p>
<p><i>Forget about the contributing factors WHY a standard deviation difference may exist – everyone realizes that the forcings on the size of the sigma may be varied and may include much more than just chromosomal influences.</i></p>
<p>You have to understand why the deviations exist or you cannot comment meaningfully. That&#8217;s why I brought in the analogy of height; it is intended to show that knowing the cause of an effect can help you determine if the effect is intrinsic or not. </p>
<p><i>I don’t know what’s more profoundly telling – the fact that those differences exist based on what we know right now, or the fact that only a few of us (me and Ian Ayres, at least) appear to be willing to talk about THE NUMBERS (as opposed to our personal FEELINGS about those numbers) straight up.</i></p>
<p>Here you are simply wrong. There are plenty of folks talking about the numbers. But they are also trying to understand what drives the numbers. Until you know what causes a phenomenon, you cannot begin to attempt a corrective action &#8211; or even know if one is needed or possible.</p>
<p><i>So where is the analogous reaction to what happened to Summers?</i></p>
<p>The difference being that Anderson was speaking from a position of well-established science, and Summers was speaking from a position of long-discredited excuses. And please remember that Summers wasn&#8217;t dismissed over this (though it may have been a contributing factor); he resigned when Harvard lost over $1 billion on the financial market after following his advice.</p>
<p><i>Did she actually contribute anything to the specific scientific dialog besides her own righteous indignation?</i></p>
<p>Yes; she even tried to work with him on the topic. Re-read the interview: &#8220;I suggested we write an article or give a talk and explain why the comments he made were factually wrong, why there’s no genetic evidence for any group of people to be inferior to others in abilities relevant in science and engineering. He said he would think about it, but I’m still waiting to hear back. That was six years ago so I don’t think he’s going to call soon.&#8221;</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Also, don&#8217;t ignore the unreliability of IQ tests when moving away from the mean.  Above about 140 or so and below about 60, the tests do not return valid numerical results.  Comparison between individuals with scores of &#8217;160&#8242; and &#8217;180&#8242; is not possible.  It&#8217;s like a car that has a speedometer up to 85 mph.  Trying to compare 100 mph vs 110 mph doesn&#8217;t result in good data.</p>
<p>For that matter, at the very high IQ ratings, the individual should know how to game the system.  The specific IQ test used will also result in variable readings.  Finally, high IQ is no guarantee of anything &#8211; the famous case in point is Kurt Godel, who died of starvation when his wife was hospitalized for six months.</p>
<p>Below an IQ of about 60, there can be trouble determining if the subject understands the questions, muhc less the &#8216;right&#8217; answer.</p>

<p>You just reminded me of a practical joke that a group of my unindicted co-conspirators played on our psychology professor. We all decided to do our best to score in the low to mid-70s on our IQ tests in the class (I managed a 72 &#8211; the first time I&#8217;ve ever been happy to see that on a test!). The professor was very confused by the results until we all started to laugh.

		<div class="comment-body"><p>I was reminded yesterday of why I read quality blogs: because the learning is deeper when the context is personal.  And the context becomes personal when one participates wholeheartedly in the process.  This opportunity for participation is distinct from our typical mode of daily learning: passive absorption of what the Information Age spews forth in vast volumes, largely through its principal carrier the internet.  All that making-science-headlines stuff that we read is very interesting and even illuminating, but it can never hold a candle to direct, goal-driven personal investigation of the type we&#8217;re doing right here in this thread.  </p>
<p>Part of that participatory investigative process involves re-accessing &#8220;settled knowledge&#8221; (I use that term loosely for lack of a better one).  And what I found yesterday is that the &#8220;settled knowledge&#8221; regarding IQ is not at all what I thought it was when we began this thread.</p>
<p>But before I get directly into that, I&#8217;d like to ask one more question of JohnD, and this is a bona fide question, not a defensive reaction on my part: at what point did we as a profession start blurring the boundary between observation and interpretation, and why did we start doing that?  Let me explain the basis for this question and my assertion that it&#8217;s judgmentally-neutral on my part.  I was brought up in an insanely-rigorous scientific disciplinary environment.  My former PI has the distinction of being known as &#8220;the father of&#8221; a particular sub-discipline.  Most grad students wouldn&#8217;t even consider joining his team because he was too intimidating (JohnD, you&#8217;d know his name if I said it).  And one of the things I was taught through all those years is that the cardinal sin of science is failure to draw the bright line between observation and interpretation.  Mentally, you have to share those magical come-to-Jesus moments with the data before you even consider forming interpretations about those data.  And then even after you form an interpretation, you better remain no more than one hairtrigger moment away from revising that interpretation upon the receipt of additional data, because new data WILL come, and they WILL matter.  Wanna incur the Wrath of PI?  Slip into the trap of becoming vested in your interpretations.  I shudder to think.  </p>
<p>This is why, when I read statements such as this:  &#8220;You have to understand why the deviations exist or you cannot comment meaningfully&#8221; my alarm bells start going off.  Part of such understanding is to acknowledge the quantitative limitations inherent in any measurement &#8211; yes.  But part of that understanding often turns out to be purely interpretive.  And we can never allow interpretations to foul the observations upon which they are based.  When I see folks expounding upon why apparent IQ differences exist, a lot of what I detect seems like it is strongly interpretational rather than objectively explanatory.  </p>
<p>That being said, I do realize two related limitations that potentially apply to me: number one, the most rigorous part of my education ended two decades ago when I transitioned from grad school followed by employment in a de facto post-doc assignment into the private sector.  The very methodology of scientific thinking itself may have evolved since my departure (or at least the bleeding edge of that thinking).  Number two, because I switched my career trajectory, I wasn&#8217;t able to keep up with any such developments that may have taken place in the intervening years, for lack of exposure.  Therefore, I may be genuinely ignorant of such developments.  You (JohnD) seem very sure of your assertions, and you ain&#8217;t dumb.  Therefore, this may be reflective of some developments in meta-cognitive procedure of which I&#8217;m not presently aware.  If such do exist, I&#8217;d invite you to expound upon them.</p>
<p>Now, with that out of the way, let me explore my &#8220;settled knowledge&#8221; statement.  </p>
<p>With respect to IQ distributions, I have necessarily had to limit myself to reviewing a few meta-analyses (I do have a job and a family that demand my attention), but what I found surprised me.  I found that the measured IQ differences between males and females in certain STEM-related functional capacities are well-documented and readily-acknowledged.  </p>
<p>You could jump right in and assert that it shows up like that because the tests are flawed, and you could note that IQ measurements are not a great success predictor, but if you do that, I think you&#8217;re going to run the risk of overlooking the fruits of those come-to-Jesus data-embracing moments, the fruits that exist irrespective of any subsequent interpretations and explanations that you or others may apply.</p>
<p>And those fruits are critically important.  Taken on their face AS data, without compulsive attempts to explain them away, I believe that they hold the key to much of this puzzle of promoting the progress of women in science.  </p>
<p>Neisser et al., in their seminal 1996 compendium (reference at end of post) noted that there are &#8220;large differences favoring males&#8221; on visual-spatial tasks &#8211; the &#8220;mean of the male distribution is nearly one standard deviation above that for females&#8221; (One sigma?! That&#8217;s *massive*!).  They also noted that males demonstrate a &#8220;substantial advantage&#8221; on math SAT scores &#8220;with many more males scoring in the highest ranges&#8221; and that &#8220;males also score consistently higher on tests of proportional and mechanical reasoning&#8221;. </p>
<p>My come-to-J moment yesterday upon reading these things was, &#8220;Holy crap.  These effects are MUCH more pronounced than I had previously been led to believe.&#8221;  I was identified at a very early age as having academic potential.  Throughout my entire educational experience, I was subjected to the mantra &#8220;girls are just as smart as boys&#8221; from every side &#8211; from family members, from teachers, and then in the later years, from professors.  Occasionally this notion would crop up that boys were better at some mechanical and mathematical tasks, but such ideas were always hastily quelled by subsequent qualifications: that the evidence for male superiority was mostly anecdotal, that those differences didn&#8217;t count for anything significant, and that the tests were biased, because really, when all is said and done, &#8220;girls are just as smart as boys&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter is, the NUMBERS do not bear that out within the realm of some of the key skills that are important to success in many STEM specialties.  Nobody is trying to argue that IQ is the ONLY be-all, end-all predictor of success.  Nobody is arguing that math and mechanical reasoning are the ONLY abilities that one must have to be successful in STEM fields.  But at the same time, unless a candidate has a really good command of those things, particularly if that candidate intends to participate in higher levels of competition, whether for a top institutional award (such as in my case), a programmatic award (e.g., Science Fair, which I&#8217;ll talk about below), for grant money, or for tenure, the candidate MUST have a threshold-level of mastery of those things.  That&#8217;s a non-negotiable prerequisite for success.</p>
<p>I always assumed that my personal experience was characterized by a healthy dose of subjectivism &#8211; that it perhaps was partly a case of boys being &#8220;smarter&#8221; than girls in the cognitive areas that posed the greatest challenges to me, but in large part, it must have actually been more a case of THOSE particular boys being &#8220;smarter&#8221; than THIS particular girl.  But after what I read yesterday, I realized that I may have actually achieved a greater degree of objectivity than I initially gave myself credit for.  I didn&#8217;t realize that the sex differences in those specific abilities had been measured to be as great as they actually are, because a wide variety of people had consistently issued statements designed to obscure the fact of it.</p>
<p>And I did NOT benefit from the obscuration that was shortsightedly intended to protect me, as a young female scientist, from the facts (presumably that obscuration was intended to protect me from becoming discouraged by the obvious ramifications of those facts).  IN fact, I almost exited the scientific field prematurely purely because of that obscuration.  For as long as I bought into the paradigm &#8220;girls are just as smart as boys&#8221;, my life was miserable.  I could achieve reasonably well in science, but I always felt like something was wrong, something was discordant, something was out of whack. And I was anxious and frustrated.  That lack of confidence in women science students referenced in the interview above?  I KNOW what that is.  It&#8217;s the uneasy feeling that one gets as a direct result of having smoke blown up one&#8217;s a**.  It&#8217;s the uncomfortable twigging sensation that reflects the discrepancy between what the subconscious SENSES to be true, and what the conscious mind is being TOLD is true.  </p>
<p>I faced a do-or-die situation upon first entering university because I had to pay for it by going into massive personal debt.  I concluded that if I couldn&#8217;t make this science pathway work the way I sensed it SHOULD work for me, then I just had to get the heck out and find something different to invest my loans in.  The worst part of that anxiety and lack of confidence was the simultaneous KNOWING that I was being held back somehow.  Not by the institution, not by any individuals &#8211; THEY were all conspiring to push me FORWARD, whether I was enjoying the ride or not!  I was being held back by PARADIGM, and the offending paradigm was &#8220;girls are just as smart as boys&#8221;.  This paradigm just wasn&#8217;t reflective of reality; that became starkly apparent during my do-or-die examination of my situation.  I realized that my only chance of being truly successful according to my potential for achievement in science was to scrap that, and adopt a new paradigm: &#8220;boys are smarter than girls in some ways, and girls are smarter than boys in some ways&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Once I did that, it was like Enterprise shifting from impulse power to warp drive.  The sky was the limit.  The anxiety and the lack of confidence instantly disappeared &#8211; I was so much happier as a person as well as being a better-performing student!  I was able to devote myself without imposed prejudice to finding genuinely-valid workarounds (rather than mere disguises) for those of my cognitive areas that were not as robust as they were in several of my male counterparts.  And I was finally able to leverage those strengths that were not just personal strengths but which are really, at the heart of them, gender strengths.</p>
<p>I am now seeing the very same experience replicated in my daughter (at that assertion, a shrewd scientist would interject the observation that consistency does not equal proof! <img src='http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  ).  By any semi-objective evaluation, the kid is smart (when she was 10 years old, her OLSAT scores were above 97th percentile, with nonverbal abilities being strongest).  But I can look at her and look at her male peers and know instantly that it&#8217;s a lost cause: if she tries to compete with them on THEIR terms (i.e., according to society&#8217;s prevailing &#8220;smartness&#8221; paradigm), she will lose.  It ain&#8217;t happening.  Restricted to such a headspace, she could do delightfully well in science-based academics, but she would never rise to fulfill her own potential unless she rejected much of the politically-correct rhetoric that she hears, and instead learns to think like a girl.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve been trying to teach this to Alisonymous Junior for several years now:  the skill of thinking like a girl, how to leverage those facets of intelligence where GIRLS are the ones with the measurable advantages, and bring those to bear on practical scientific challenges.  Even after having attained new awarenesses about WHAT IT MEANS to think like a girl, I admit that I&#8217;m not immune to the influences of society&#8217;s persistent paradigms to the contrary.  If you live in manure, you&#8217;re going to smell like manure despite your best efforts.  So I have this meditative procedure in which I try to pep-talk myself away from that trap:  &#8220;Vacate the paradigms.  Don&#8217;t slip back into that mode.  Don&#8217;t let everybody in the establishment, including other women, tell you how you&#8217;re supposed to think.  Think like a girl instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>I maintain that the proof of such teaching is in the pudding (although again, from any shrewd scientist, there would be raucous cries of &#8220;Confounds!&#8221;).  Thus far, Alisonymous Junior is a four-time Clear Creek ISD Science Fair medalist, in very large part because of conscious intentional girl-thinking.  CCISD is a large district (38,000 students) and its science programs are dominated by NASA families, which are among America&#8217;s most academically-brilliant people.  To achieve ANY competitive traction in that environment is noteworthy.  Three of her four medals have been first place gold medals &#8211; the top prizes in those District-wide categories.  And the fourth one was a project that went on to take a trophy at the Houston regional Science Fair.  (And that success is NOT a result of me &#8211; I&#8217;m merely a coach, a minor role in the equation.  Alisonymous Junior is just as headstrong as I was (am), is NOT inclined to allow anyone to lead her by the nose, least of all her tragically un-cool mother &#8211; horrors!, and certainly has the potential to be every bit as obnoxiously outspoken as I am.  <img src='http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  )</p>
<p>In sum, I will advise this much:</p>
<p>Do you have a friend, niece, daughter, co-worker, or other young female in your life who you&#8217;d like to encourage with respect to an educational and career pathway in a STEM field?  If the answer is yes, then do her a massive favor: sidestep the obscurations, patronizations, paradigms, politicizations, and &#8220;equalizations&#8221; that now cripple those educational and career pathways, and instead, help her learn how to think like a girl.  That kind of thinking will serve her best, because that is what she was born to do.  </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p><i>But before I get directly into that, I&#8217;d like to ask one more question of JohnD, and this is a bona fide question, not a defensive reaction on my part: at what point did we as a profession start blurring the boundary between observation and interpretation, and why did we start doing that?</i></p>
<p>Aristotle, 350 BCE&#8230; <img src='http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif' alt='8-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Seriously, I think that the problem is that what you are calling &#8220;interpretation&#8221; others would call &#8220;understanding&#8221;. If you want to understand an effect, it isn&#8217;t enough to simply provide the descriptive statistics. You need to understand how those statistics arose, which then leads you into a fuller description of the effect (preferably as a mathematical function). Note that I do <b>not</b> suggest that you should let the description (be it statistical, mathematical, or schema) determine the results; what I do claim is that understanding the effect will tell you where to look for new information that isn&#8217;t in your current data set. And that&#8217;s what turns a good scientist into a great one &#8211; looking where no-one else has.</p>
<p><i>When I see folks expounding upon why apparent IQ differences exist, a lot of what I detect seems like it is strongly interpretational rather than objectively explanatory.</i></p>
<p>There is unfortunately a lot of that going on, mainly because it is such a poorly-posed problem that we don&#8217;t know enough to ask the right questions and gather the right data sets yet.</p>
<p><i>You (JohnD) seem very sure of your assertions, and you ain&#8217;t dumb.</i></p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that I can&#8217;t make an ass of myself, just like everyone else. Eric will attest to this, I am sure.</p>
<p><i>You could jump right in and assert that it shows up like that because the tests are flawed, and you could note that IQ measurements are not a great success predictor, but if you do that, I think you&#8217;re going to run the risk of overlooking the fruits of those come-to-Jesus data-embracing moments, the fruits that exist irrespective of any subsequent interpretations and explanations that you or others may apply.</i></p>
<p>Philosophically, I tend to be a utilitarian. If there is a measurable difference in one parameter but it has no effect on the outcome, is it truly an important difference? That&#8217;s why I pointed out that IQ is not a good predictor of success. Since IQ has little relationship to the outcome, why worry about it?</p>
<p><i>Neisser et al., in their seminal 1996 compendium noted that there are &#8220;large differences favoring males&#8221; on visual-spatial tasks – the &#8220;mean of the male distribution is nearly one standard deviation above that for females&#8221; (One sigma?! That&#8217;s *massive*!). They also noted that males demonstrate a &#8220;substantial advantage&#8221; on math SAT scores &#8220;with many more males scoring in the highest ranges&#8221; and that &#8220;males also score consistently higher on tests of proportional and mechanical reasoning&#8221;.</i></p>
<p>That is interesting. Has their work been replicated? (Remember <a HREF="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/regrmean.php" rel="nofollow">regression to the mean</a>!) There have been <a HREF="http://en.scientificcommons.org/45424237" rel="nofollow">other studies</a> that show a <a HREF="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191886994900302" rel="nofollow">much less dramatic relationship</a>. And has there been a study showing that people who score higher on the math SAT do better as scientists? Have social factors such as <a HREF="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1182118?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=55965657463" rel="nofollow">biases in pre-knowledge</a>, <a HREF="http://www.springerlink.com/content/q59m03m3g2773325/" rel="nofollow">parental bias</a>, <a>rater bias</a>, and <a HREF="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/29/1/80/" rel="nofollow">self bias</a> been taken into account? Unless you can show that the two are related after all known biases are taken into account, then you run the risk of letting your personal bias drive the interpretation.</p>
<p><i>But the fact of the matter is, the NUMBERS do not bear that out within the realm of some of the key skills that are important to success in many STEM specialties. Nobody is trying to argue that IQ is the ONLY be-all, end-all predictor of success. Nobody is arguing that math and mechanical reasoning are the ONLY abilities that one must have to be successful in STEM fields. But at the same time, unless a candidate has a really good command of those things, particularly if that candidate intends to participate in higher levels of competition, whether for a top institutional award (such as in my case), a programmatic award (e.g., Science Fair, which I&#8217;ll talk about below), for grant money, or for tenure, the candidate MUST have a threshold-level of mastery of those things. That&#8217;s a non-negotiable prerequisite for success.</i></p>
<p>You are arguing your conclusion. Unless you can show that the difference is inherent as opposed to being created by external factors, you have not shown that women cannot compete at the same level; you have merely shown that they have not done so as yet.</p>
<p>Going back to my height example, if I claimed that the data showed that people in the 1980s were taller than those in the 1930s, I&#8217;d be right. But if I claimed that it showed that people in the 1930s couldn&#8217;t be as tall as those in the 1980s, I&#8217;d be flat wrong. That&#8217;s because we understand that improved nutrition and improved medical care have allowed us to reach our potential, height-wise. Had a population from the 1930s been transplanted into 1980, they would have grown up just as tall as their neighbors. And that&#8217;s what I meant by needing to understand where the difference come from in order to comment meaningfully.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s apply that to women in science. You are claiming that IQ tests tend to show that men do better than women in some key areas. But you haven&#8217;t shown that the difference would persist even in the presence of equal social rewards and opportunities (indeed, in most of the work I&#8217;ve seen, when those factors are accounted for the difference vanishes). You have not taken those confounding factors into account. Until they have been, the data is interesting but not compelling.</p>
<p><i>For as long as I bought into the paradigm &#8220;girls are just as smart as boys&#8221;, my life was miserable.</i></p>
<p>Can you show that women are inherently less intelligent than men? Your data thus far does not bear out that conclusion.</p>
<p><i>Do you have a friend, niece, daughter, co-worker, or other young female in your life who you&#8217;d like to encourage with respect to an educational and career pathway in a STEM field?</i></p>
<p>Yes, I do. I&#8217;ve taken her to several places where she can interact with other female scientists, and helped her blow stuff up. (Explosions are cool, no matter if you are a boy or a girl.) And I have encouraged her to be herself and not me nor anyone else.</p>
<p><i>The URLs for the main IQ compendium I referenced above are obscure and I&#8217;m afraid that the online PDFs might represent copyright infringements,</i></p>
<p>If they are on the author&#8217;s website, then they don&#8217;t. And they probably represent fair use in most other situations. But you could always just go with the standard:<br />

		<div class="comment-body"><p>&#8220;Philosophically, I tend to be a utilitarian. If there is a measurable difference in one parameter but it has no effect on the outcome, is it truly an important difference? That’s why I pointed out that IQ is not a good predictor of success. Since IQ has little relationship to the outcome, why worry about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The inclination toward utilitarianism is partly a gender influence upon the process of cognition.<br />
 <img src='http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Even before I read your latest comments, it had occurred to me that I might have more success in making my points if I simply engaged the debate from a more mechanistic perspective.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Why worry about it?&#8221;  Follow the money.  Because IQ measures are correlated with test scores, and test scores translate into GPA outcomes, which determine the entire gamut of academic access from admissions to scholarships (scholarships were huge for me because I was funded by loans).  </p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not bulls*** ourselves: we are NOT talking about Fun, Fair, Positive Soccer here.  We&#8217;re talking about cutthroat academic environments.  That male who outscored me on his quantitative SAT is going to be the exact same male who is sitting beside me in geophysics class.  And if I don&#8217;t identify my own unique way to play conceptual tortoise to his mechanical hare, I&#8217;m *FINISHED*, because he&#8217;s going to mop the hallowed institutional floor with me, performance-wise, just as he did on the SAT.  I don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s bottom WHY his quantitative scores are higher, HOW they got to be that way, whether they SHOULD be that way or are distorted by inaccurate measurement, or what it all means for my relative long-term life success.  In that scenario, I do not have the luxury of entertaining such questions.  All I know is that I face a discrete practical issue that requires an immediate solution: how to get a better grade than him through the application of authentic effort.  </p>
<p>And of course, the scenarios I&#8217;ve described, both mine and my daughter&#8217;s, are end-member competitive extremities.  But a measure of the same headspace applies to everyone who enrolls in post-secondary education.    We&#8217;re in competition for a well-defined collection of short-term rewards, which are not all equivalent.  When you&#8217;re engrossed in that space, it doesn&#8217;t matter to you what your long-term career ramifications are.  It matters where you fall on the curve for that course that required a few thousand dollars for you to participate in.</p>
<p>I had further realizations about the whole girl-think issue after what I wrote yesterday.  I&#8217;ve been operating from these principles for years, but no situation has called upon me to articulate them before now.  I can add the following:</p>
<p>(1) The attempt to excise gender from evaluation of STEM-related aptitudes is, on its most fundamental level, an attempt to excise gender, period, which is actually an attempt to excise identity, which makes absolutely no existential sense.  If we accept the paradigm &#8220;girls are just as smart as boys&#8221;, really what we&#8217;re saying is that Alisonymous is a person first, a scientist second, and a girl third.  Well, I have a huge problem with that, because that&#8217;s not the way I perceive myself.  I see myself as a person first, a girl second, and a scientist third.  Why on earth would I discard or even minimize the gender component of my identity?!  It&#8217;s fundamental to who I am, and is one of my greatest sources of strength, intellectually and otherwise.  </p>
<p>So there&#8217;s that, a nasty little byproduct of the prevailing &#8220;equal cannot mean equal-but-different&#8221; decree.  </p>
<p>But here&#8217;s something more profound: it was only this morning that I realized WHY society is so resistant to the alternate paradigm &#8220;boys are smarter in some ways, and girls are smarter in some ways&#8221;.  It&#8217;s because where STEM is concerned, the relative intellectual advantages of girls are not seen as being consequential.  There&#8217;s almost a sense that those strengths constitute nothing more than a genetic consolation prize of sorts.  Paraphrasing the attitudes I&#8217;ve always sensed:  &#8220;Verbal?!  Well, heh heh, verbal superiority is all very well and good, how nice for you, but verbal doesn&#8217;t make the world go &#8217;round.  And memory?  Mmmm, that&#8217;s a fun thing, too, but it won&#8217;t build bridges or rockets or cure cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong answers.  &#8216;Verbal&#8217; happens to reflect the mechanism that underlies the definition and organization of the very products of cognition.  And memory is the feature that makes those cognitive products available for organization and manipulation.  And the Holy Grail derivative of both:  the process of association, which often manifests in everyday life as &#8220;noticing things&#8221;.  Wives notice all these little things of the type that drive their husbands absolutely batty because the husbands don&#8217;t think that those things warrant attention; they often classify them as &#8220;mental clutter&#8221;.  Even more tedious to men:  &#8220;womens&#8217; intuition&#8221;.  I have a hunch that women, if properly allowed to BE women, would have tremendous incremental capacity to &#8220;notice things&#8221; and to further develop their capacities to intuit associations in STEM-related fields.  But instead, they are largely forced into these little &#8220;you-are-the-same-as-men&#8221; paradigm boxes that are so uncomfortable and which, if accepted wholeheartedly, just might doom them to dissatisfaction and reduced performance in STEM careers (if they even stick with those careers).  </p>
<p>I have successfully leveraged that incremental capacity for associative insight with my daughter.  Every time she kicks off a new science project, I start with (paraphrasing), &#8220;OK, our first task is to figure out WHAT IT IS in the way of an important perspective that is right under our noses, that every other person in this city of six million people has utterly overlooked.  THAT is where we need to start with our focus, because THAT is one of the things we do best as girls.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Translation: form associations that nobody else has been able to form yet, perhaps because they simply did not notice a basis for association, or perhaps because they either ouvertly or subconsciously concluded that the associations were too trivial to bother with, an error people tend to make when they are unable transcend mechanical perspectives to see just how importantly those things actually integrate into the big picture of the world&#8217;s workings.  Does that sound familiar?  It should.  It&#8217;s one of the processes by which science advances.</p>

<p>I do not deny that this is an important topic; I merely point out that you have not demonstrated that the IQ differences are innate. Indeed, much of the literature indicates that they are not innate.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it is because the alternate paradigm has not yet been demonstrated to be anything but social bias. Follow the links I provided on bias. Read the papers.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Great interview, Eric! I know the science community is gradually becoming aware that getting women involved in STEM (especially engineering) is an important challenge to overcome. As Nancy Hopkins observed, there are many barriers that most people don&#8217;t realize. Hope that she&#8217;s right about 10-15 years being the time it takes to see the numbers start to balance out.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>craig, I think Dan is right. 1957 is not &#8220;the late 60&#8242;s&#8221;; it isn&#8217;t even the early 60s. As Dr. J points out, she probably was speaking <i>ex tempore</i> and just got the sequence of events a little garbled.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>If the Severely Conservatives gain control of all 3 branches of government they will not only want to roll back this advance for women but take away their right to vote as well. Progress is an anathema for them. Their belief is if it wasn&#8217;t done before that&#8217;s good enough for them&#8230;they will never do it. Change is something they can&#8217;t believe in.</p>
