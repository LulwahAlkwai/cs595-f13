   Why VCE Is The Only True Convergence Company. Because they are the only
   firm built to be one.
   It comes down to what is key to convergence. It isn't about servers,
   networking, storage, or services any more than a car is about wheels,
   tires, engines, doors, or body. It is about building a solution and
   with a solution the parts have to work together. VCE is the only
   company in their class that was designed specifically to create
   converged products, they don't build or focus on the components, and
   those are outsourced. This is why their solutions have more substance
   than the ones they compete against. This is the thesis of my
   ITBusinessEdge post this week:
