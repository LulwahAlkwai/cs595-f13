America's top spies go up against a crowd

   [141]August 21, 2012|Ken Dilanian

   WASHINGTON -- Nine years ago, Congress blocked a Pentagon agency from
   setting up a website that would have allowed anyone with a credit card
   to bet on the likelihood of foreign assassinations, coups and terrorist
   attacks.

   The idea was to take advantage of the "wisdom of crowds," a social
   science maxim that contends the average of a group of forecasters,
   under certain circumstances, tends to be more accurate than even the
   most knowledgeable single forecaster.

   For The Record
   Los Angeles Times Thursday, August 23, 2012 Home Edition Main News Part
   A Page 4 News Desk 2 inches; 60 words Type of Material: Correction
   CIA crowd-sourcing: An article in the Aug. 21 Section A about a federal
   study into the "wisdom of crowds" said that participants were asked to
   assess the likelihood of future terrorist strikes, among other topics.
   Questions about terrorist attacks are prohibited in the program, said
   Cherreka Montgomery, spokeswoman for the Intelligence Advanced Research
   Projects Activity, which is conducting the study.

   IFRAME: [142]about:blank

   But lawmakers worried the proposed predictions market could allow
   terrorists to profit from their own misdeeds. Congress forced the
   Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- the military's
   cutting-edge research arm, known as DARPA -- to scuttle the program.

   Now terrorism futures are back.

   DARPA's sister agency -- the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects
   Activity, which funds experimental projects for the U.S. intelligence
   community -- is running a four-year, $50-million program that pays
   people willing to predict major world events, including wars and
   terrorist strikes. Unlike the earlier scheme, participants can't profit
   from their predictions.

   Now in its second year, the so-called crowd-sourcing project involves
   competing corporate and university teams, including UC Irvine. Each
   team includes more than a dozen social scientists and as many as 2,000
   participants, who can answer hundreds of questions each if they want.

   The study, known as Aggregative Contingent Estimation, is designed to
   see whether the 17 agencies in the U.S. intelligence community can
   aggregate the judgment of its thousands of analysts -- rather than rely
   on the expertise of just a few -- to issue more accurate warnings to
   policy makers before and during major global events.

   Participants in the project give their best guesses on whether the Free
   Syrian Army will gain control of Aleppo, for example, or whether Kim
   Jong Un will resign as the leader of North Korea before April 1, 2013,
   according to project websites.

   Initial results are promising, according to Philip Tetlock, a
   University of Pennsylvania professor who leads one of the teams.

   His 2005 book, "Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We
   Know?" showed that political pundits often fared worse in predictions
   than the proverbial dart-throwing monkey.

   "The idea that the average of a group of forecasters is more accurate
   than any one forecaster goes back 100 years," Tetlock said. In 1906,
   British scientist Francis Galton determined that the average of 787
   guesses about the weight of an ox at a county fair was startlingly
   accurate.

   The teams are trying to beat the average by using algorithms that, over
   time, give greater weight to the most successful crystal gazers among
   their participants and weed out the worst.

   Tetlock's group, the Good Judgment Project, is in the lead so far.

   "In year one, we beat the unweighted average by about 57%, which was
   big," he said. A control group, run by Mitre Corp., averages scores
   without giving weight to participants who tally the best results.

   Predicting world-changing events is never easy. U.S. intelligence
   agencies failed to foresee the fall of the Soviet Union, to predict the
   terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and, more recently, to anticipate
   political upheaval across the Arab world.

   The CIA and other agencies tend to rely on small groups of experts who
   hash out consensus judgments. If there is strong disagreement among the
   analysts, or between different agencies, an intelligence report will
   note that.

   Crowd-sourcing would mean, in theory, polling large groups across the
   200,000-person intelligence community, or outside experts with security
   clearances, to aggregate their views about the strength of the Taliban,
   say, or the likelihood that Iran is secretly building a nuclear weapon.

   For now, there is deep skepticism in intelligence circles.

   "I don't believe in the wisdom of crowds," said Mark Lowenthal, a
   former senior CIA and State Department analyst (and 1988 "Jeopardy!"
   champion) who now teaches classified courses about intelligence.
   "Crowds produce riots. Experts produce wisdom."

   Others argue that intelligence analysis can benefit from data-driven
   social science.

   The CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, was an early investor in a
   private company called Recorded Future, headquartered in Cambridge,
   Mass., and Goteborg, Sweden, which uses data on the Internet, from
   securities filings to Facebook posts to government statistics, to make
   connections and spot trends.

   A National Academy of Sciences report last year commissioned by former
   National Intelligence Director Dennis C. Blair found that intelligence
   practices "have been only weakly informed by the behavioral and social
   sciences." The report recommended that "science and evidence-based
   protocols" be introduced and evaluated alongside the spy agencies'
   traditional reliance on expert judgment.
