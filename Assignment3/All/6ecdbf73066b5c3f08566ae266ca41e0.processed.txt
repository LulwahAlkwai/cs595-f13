Italy fact of the day

     Italians' relatively low Internet usage--37% of Italians have never
     used Internet, compared with an EU average of 22%--present a unique
     challenge, says Donatella Treu, CEO of Italian business daily Il
     Sole 24 Ore.

   Here is [7]more, mostly about the economic problems newspapers are
   facing in Europe.

          Is this really anything more than a short term problem? Internet
          usage is rising rapidly and Italy is trailing by at most 5
          years. So, eventually most large countries will hit the 90% mark
          and probably have a marked slow down in growth as the only non
          users left will be the old and really young. And then Italy's
          usage will most likely converge with the rest of the developed
          world.

          For reference, usage in developed countries:

          2005 51%

          2010 67%

          2013 77%

                This assumes that all countries are progressing at the
                same rate-in which case, how did this occur in the first
                place? The internet became available to all Western
                European countries roughly at the same time. Italy started
                out at the same point and fell behind.

                Taking 1995 as a reasonable start point for internet
                adoption, being five years behind would mean Italy's pace
                of technology adoption is only 70% as fast as the EU as a
                whole. I think that should be a worrying statistic-all
                else being equal.

                One possible contributing factor is that the median age of
                Italy is the highest in Europe (except for Monaco), about
                3 years higher than the overall average.

                      `would mean Italy's pace of technology adoption is
                      only 70% as fast as the EU as a whole'

                      This is odd - a lot of older Italians refuse to use
                      credit cards (at least according to several Italians
                      I know, talking about family members), and it is not
                      a sign that they are not aware of modern banking
                      (which was essentially an Italian invention, after
                      all). Instead, they have no desire to participate in
                      a system that records all their transactions.

                      Instead, they seem fully aware just how credit cards
                      provide information to people that those older
                      Italians have no intention sharing information with.

                      And the strange thing? Snowden's ongoing revelations
                      of just how thoroughly the Internet is monitored
                      means that the same sort of Italian utterly
                      uninterested in the benefits of the modern credit
                      card based economy were correct in their disdain in
                      regards to the interconnected database financial
                      system.

                      Some people, especially older ones with a quite
                      different set of memories and experiences, prefer
                      keeping their affairs private - Facebook, Gmail, etc
                      are not a sign of technology adoption. They are a
                      sign of just how effective automated privacy
                      invasion has become.

                            Is it true that the reason old people in Italy
                            don't adopt technology is because they fear
                            monitoring of their information?

                            In my limited experience, Italians, young and
                            old alike, don't use credit cards because it
                            seems idiotic spend money you don't have.
                            Consumer credit is almost non-existant. Only
                            in recent years has the use of debit cards
                            become widespread.

          Great food, good wine, beautiful women, wonderful public spaces,
          a festive culture, charming restaurants and cafes. I'd probably
          spend less time on my computer too.

                No jobs, crumbling infrastructure, people living with
                their parents in their 30s, a corrupt & completely broken
                political culture, restaurants and cafes you can't afford.
                I'd probably spend all time on my computer.

          I'll grant you the great food and good wine, but the public
          spaces in Italy are terrible. I've lived there for close to a
          year, and I can tell you the state of their public spaces is the
          same as the state of their public finances. Nobody cares.

          One wonders if Italy really ought to not be one country. As few
          as three (Venice, Padania ex. Venice, and Sicily/Naples) or
          maybe as many as five or six (Sicily and Naples become separate,
          and the north can split as needed)?

                Why stop there, one should have to cross two international
                boundaries to get from Bologna to the Adriatic, Viva
                Faenza Indipendente!

                Given my knowledge of modern Italy this would not only not
                lead to better government but promote even more parrochial
                oppression and higher government overhead. The only way
                this could work is if you kept them all under the EU and
                then gave the EU an army, a heavily armed genderme, and
                total police powers. And if you think modern Italy is bad,
                I just proposed something cartoonishly worse.

                      What reason do you have to think that the various
                      post-Italian rump states would be violent towards
                      one another? The Benelux countries seem to do pretty
                      well together.

                      It's a fact of history that Italians have
                      historically never considered themselves to be one
                      people/nation/ethnicity and in many ways still don't
                      even to this day. The modern nation of "Italy" was
                      clumsily, and for the most part involuntarily,
                      cobbled together from a collection of smaller states
                      by a group of idealistic nationalists intent on
                      creating a great European military power. It hasn't
                      worked out very well, with military misadventures
                      before and during WWII and rampant corruption after.
                      But that shouldn't come as much of a surprise. When
                      people don't feel a strong connection to their
                      country, civic-mindedness suffers, and dishonesty
                      and corruption often follow.

                            Did I ever say they would be violent toward
                            each other? WhenI mentioned an EU with police
                            powers I was referring to local corruption,
                            parochial oppression, and crime.

                            Can you imagine the policing issues with
                            dozens of Italian city states? The potential
                            for organized crime, which is not confined to
                            just the south, alone is incredible. As to
                            Italian unity, the Risorgimento was pretty
                            popular at the time and this was because there
                            was, and remains, a sense of genuine Italian
                            nationalism. That this nationalism may be more
                            about, pardon my language here, "Stop hitting
                            my bitch" than anything constructive is beside
                            the point, it does exist. And if you think a
                            Nationalism of the North is more meaningful to
                            people, I strongly suspect you are wrong.
                            Maybe for historic regions like the Veneto or
                            Milan it could work, but the whole of the
                            North, or even the Po, this is more arbitrary
                            and artificial than Italy as a whole.

                                  Political devolution and secession are
                                  areas where people like to imagine that
                                  history has crystallized. Do you really
                                  think it will be Italy, the UK, the USA,
                                  Iraq, etc. from now until the end of
                                  time?

                                  Per the commenter above, `Italy' doesn't
                                  seem to be working. When there was no
                                  `Italy' we had the Renaissance.

                                  I don't know if it's related, but you
                                  see the same sort of attitude in the
                                  natural sciences. People are really
                                  passionate about `evolution' but only so
                                  long as it's confined to the neck down
                                  and stopped 40,000 years ago.

                                  I think we'll just have to agree to
                                  disagree on the Risorgimento, though I
                                  agree that a push for Padania is less an
                                  actual nationalism and more of a
                                  reaction to perceived southern
                                  corruption.

                                  I am just not following you with this
                                  policing/crime issue. Why would it be
                                  harder to police a group of smaller
                                  states (I never said dozens, as that
                                  would almost surely be too many)? We do
                                  most law enforcement locally and
                                  regionally in the US, with the FBI only
                                  occasionally getting involved, and that
                                  system most assuredly works better than
                                  if there were simply one national police
                                  force. And do you mean to suggest that
                                  Italy doesn't have a problem with
                                  organized crime right now? I would think
                                  that a number of smaller states would be
                                  less prone to organized crime than a
                                  unified one, as they would have less of
                                  a captive audience of people and
                                  capital, and exit is easier (Tiebout and
                                  all that).

                                  I don't think Italy or the US or
                                  anything will last till the end of time,
                                  but Italy, unlike say Yugoslavia or even
                                  Spain, doesn't serm to be brimming with
                                  genuine seccessionist groups. I haven't
                                  noticed the the Northern League having
                                  ever had a paramilitary arm, honestly
                                  outside of the Veneto, I have never met
                                  an Italian seperatist having the
                                  enthusiasm of even a Texas or Alaskan
                                  seccessionist let alone the PQ. The only
                                  Italians with that sort of National
                                  conciousness seem to be on Sicily and
                                  Sardinia, and they would have way too
                                  much to lose at the moment. Spain has
                                  had how many civil wars in the last two
                                  centuries? How many has Italy had? And
                                  how many didn't involve an occuppying
                                  foreign army?

                                  Of course I am not saying that things
                                  couldn't change, the collapse of the
                                  Italian state would do a lot for Italian
                                  regional nationalism, but then so would
                                  a nuclear war or the collapse of
                                  technological civilization. Even with
                                  Eurogeddon I just don't see it
                                  happening. This is just masturbatory
                                  talk. One might as well talk about the
                                  recreation of the Republic of the Rio

          Interestingly, my local newspaper (Neue Luzerner Zeitung) just
          yesterday reported a 12% increase in readership, year over year,
          for the daily paper, and a 24% increase in readership for the
          Sunday edition. Not sure what is driving this, but it seems they
