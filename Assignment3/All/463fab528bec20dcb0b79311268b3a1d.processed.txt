   Microsoft Trounces Google and Makes Them Look like a Patent Troll in
   decisive Motorola litigation win.
   The background here is that Google bought Motorola in order to get
   patents they could use to push back on Microsoft who was getting more
   money, as a result of licensing of core technology they argued Google
   stole (Apple had similar complaints but moved to shut folks like
   Samsung down instead), than Google was from Android. You could argue
   that Android is more profitable to Microsoft, in terms of margin (since
   Google does all the work) than any Microsoft branded platform was and
   Google wanted Motorola's patents to get that to stop. Unfortunately,
   Google didn't do their homework and realize that Motorola's patents,
   when they were pushed as standards, were put under FRAND agreements as
   a condition meaning they couldn't be used this way. (Vendors put
   patents under FRAND rules in order to get other vendors to use them as
   standards and this assures those vendors won't pay a high price for
   licensing them). A Jure affirmed this and gave Microsoft a massive win
   suggesting Google really screwed up in the Motorola acquisition and,
   once again, that using patents under FRAM agreements offensively is
   like entering a sword fight with a bundle of flowers, and it doesn't
   end well. Details in All Things D this week:
