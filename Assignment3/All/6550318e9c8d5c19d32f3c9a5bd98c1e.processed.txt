Description

   "The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a
   spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation
   of a Turing machine."-TIME

   In this accessible new selection of writings by Information Age pioneer
   Alan Turing, readers will find many of the most significant
   contributions from the four-volume set of the Collected Works of A. M.
   Turing. These contributions, together with commentaries from current
   experts in a wide spectrum of fields and backgrounds, provide insight
   on the significance and contemporary impact of A.M. Turing's work.

   Offering a more modern perspective than anything currently available,
   Alan Turing: His Work and Impact gives wide coverage of the many ways
   in which Turing's scientific endeavors have impacted current research
   and understanding of the world. His pivotal writings on subjects
   including computing, artificial intelligence, cryptography,
   morphogenesis, and more display continued relevance and insight into
   today's scientific and technological landscape. This collection
   provides a great service to researchers, but is also an approachable
   entry point for readers with limited training in the science, but an
   urge to learn more about the details of Turing's work.

   Readership

   Researchers and scientists interested in the context and significance
   of Turing's impact on artificial intelligence, artificial neural
   networks, morphogenesis, cryptology, the philosophy of mind,
   mathematics, computing, computer science, informatics, morphogenesis,
   philosophy and the wider scientific world.

Quotes and reviews

   "...much of what's presented is for specialists...But there's still
   plenty even for a non-mathematician like me, some of it surprisingly
   moving...no matter how well you know the life and work of Turing,
   you'll learn something from this book."--OECD Insights blog, August 26,
   2013
   "This accessible book is an essential read for those interested in
   Turing's work and provides a more contemporary perspective than
   anything else that is available."--CyberTalk, September 2013
   "This volume contains a mix of writings - some excerpts by Turing, but
   mostly writings about him and his work by those who understand his
   genius and his legacy. The writings include first person narratives of
   what he was like and what it was like to work with him, personal
   accounts of career-changing encounters with his thinking, and
   commentary on particular aspects of his work."--Reference and Research
   Book News, August 2013
   "The new testament of computer science has come, 101 years after the
   birth of founding prophet Alan Turing...How big is the incomputable
   universe? Can digital machines think? Do daisies emerge from pure
   chemistry? If your soul craves answers to such questions, this is your
   new bible."--Nature, June 19, 2013
   "Alan Turing: His Work and Impact makes Turing's most important papers
   readily accessible and affordable. With the four volumes of the
   previously published "Collected Works" now scarce and very expensive,
   this volume fills a pressing need in Turing scholarship. Moreover, the
   commentaries associated with Turing's papers in this volume offer new
   and compelling insights into the continuing importance and relevance of
   Turing's work, contextualizing it in contemporary contexts and
   providing richly elaborated explanations of how and why Turing's work
   remains seminal for a wide variety of fields, including computational
   science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and more." -- N.
   Katherine Hayles, Professor of Literature, Duke University
