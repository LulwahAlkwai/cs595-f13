   A job interview is no easy task. In fact many job seekers have trouble
   with the same set of questions. To ease the process of interviewing,
   we've listed the Top 10 Hardest Job Interview Questions. Focus on these
   job interview questions, study them, learn them, research them, and ace
   your next job interview!
   1. Why did you get fired/ terminated? - This question is tricky yet
   needs to be answered with full honesty. The interviewer would want to
   hear your honesty and your side of the story. Support your answer with
   a very good explanation. In case you get fired due to legal issues,
   explain that you were currently working on it and that it does not have
   anything to do with your performance. Your explanation in your answer
   is very important; it should be direct and should not contain
   intersections.
   2. Tell me about problems you encountered with Supervisors- Another
   tricky question that will test how you worked with your superiors. I
   suggest not to be too honest in answering this question. For example,
   common observations such as being bossy, opinionated, authoritarian, or
   being a keen observer are the common traits of a Supervisor that are
   incorrectly used. Instead, cite a personal experience that you had
   encounter with a supervisor so that the interviewer would understand
   why it became your problem.
   3. What Qualities do you look for in a boss? - Do not answer with the
   most common traits that a boss should possess like "being nice to
   employees" or a good leader. You should relate your answer with your
   work. For example "My ideal boss is someone who can make time to hear
   employees' opinions or ideas, and a boss who cares to listen and give
   fair his/her opinion with my work."
   4. As a professional, do you have any disappointments? - Cite the
   experience that really disappoints you, as you relay the story behind
   it make sure that you state something that you have learned after.
