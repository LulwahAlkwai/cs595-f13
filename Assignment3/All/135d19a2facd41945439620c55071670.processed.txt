Product Information

     *

Overview
       The Tech21 Impact Mesh case is the ultimate impact protection
       design, fully integrated with D3O for your iPhone 5. The D3O
       material provides a barrier between your iPhone and everyday
       accidents. If you should drop your iPhone, the molecules within D3O
       lock together upon impact, absorbing the energy and dispersing the
       energy away from it--so you have an added layer of durability.
     *

            protection material

Smooth contours, grippy yet easy to pull from pocket, slick looks & D3O!!!
       5.0 out of 5 stars
       This is a really nice well made case. I ordered it on a whim as I
       prefer to not use a case with my iPhones, but the iPhone 5 is su ch
       a jewel and so slippery. I have the black phone and the smoke color
       case and they look slick together. It is not really mesh, but a
       texture that is within the smooth semitransparent back. It has a
       shape that is comfortable to hold and very slim (perfect for
       someone who doesn't want a case but needs one). I ride off road
       motorcycles and my body armor is made of D3O material. This stuff
       is unreal. It's amazing impact absorbing properties is hard to
       realize examining this case, but my experience with this stuff in
       my body armor makes me very comfortable with the idea of dropping
       my phone. ... (BUTTON) More (Read full review)

Great iPhone Case
       5.0 out of 5 stars
       Before Tech21 was even in Apple Stores, I purchased the impact case
       for my iPhone 4 several months ago. It has a great feel in you r
       hand, fits the phone well, and the phone remains intact (good
       protection). Then I got an iPhone 5, gave my case to my dad, and
       bought 2 more (one for my mom). The iPhone 5 case is even better.
       It is slimmer and offers the same protection. The only weakness is
       on the bottom where material becomes thin to allow access across
       the speaker, lightning port, and headphone port. However, it
       doesn't harm the structural integrity of the case because the
       corners are strong. I would recommend to anyone. ... (BUTTON) More

Screen Protector Nightmare
       3.0 out of 5 stars
       Just wanted everyone to know that if you have a screen protector on
       your phone, this is not the case for you. Bought it and loved it
       for the first day, but then it started peeling off my invisible
       shield on all the edges and corners-disaster. It's a great case if
       you don't have a screen protector, but don't buy it if you do! It
       will just make you sad that you can't use it. ... (BUTTON) More

Best Case I Ever Own
       5.0 out of 5 stars
       I love this case! I stood in the store trying out different cases.
       Other cases felt like I had no control over the grip of the i
       Phone, and I wanted to make sure it was protected if I do drop my
       iphone.
       This case has the best feel and I love the grip. Also, the case
       itself covers the edge of the iPhone, which I do like. Make sure
       you get the Tech 21 Impact "Mesh" b/c there other cases did not
       have the feel as to this one. ... (BUTTON) More (Read full review)

Sleek case, great casual drop protection
       5.0 out of 5 stars
       Recently purchased this for my 5S and have been extremely pleased
       thus far. The case material is quite grippy in your hand, yet sl
       ides smoothly in and out of pants pockets. The button presses are a
       bit firm, but doesn't require the ridiculous amount of force to
       depress that many other high-end protective cases possess. The
       ports for the mute switch, charging port and headphone jack all
       line up very well and have stayed that way.
       I went with the smokey color, which pairs well with the black
       phone. The unit remains very slim and the orange glow of the D30
       material is very tame, allowing it to still look sleek and
       professional.
       My biggest concern when purchasing was how it would hold up to the
       inevitable first drop. I fumbled the phone about two days into
       owning it, with it landing screen side down on concrete from about
       four feet in the air. Not a scratch or crack could be found on the
       device and only the slightest of nicks was made in the case
       material. Overall, highly recommended. ... (BUTTON) More (Read full
