       Amazon's Kindle app now has an all-new design, as well as a new
       "Collections" feature to help them organize their books, documents,
       and magazines. You could, for instance, have a collection for your

       potentially include the same book in both.
    2. Ipad_cards_airplane_mode__1_

[49]Evernote
       Evernote has a new home screen, which brings all your personal and
       business notes, notebook, tags, shortcuts and announcements onto
       the same page, new Quicknote feature, and image and PDF markup.
       Notes can also be shared with others through the app using iOS 7's

       with the new app, and a new enhancement lets you include location,
       friends and comments when you share your Shazams with your friends.
    4. Screen-shot-2013-09-18-at-10-53-44-am

       TED's iOS 7 app sports a fresh new user interface, improved audio
       bar with time seeker and more.
       "For this latest update, we simplified our app's interface to make
       its functionality more useful - a combination of efforts inspired
       by our own TED design ethos and Apple's vision for iOS7. As Apple
       puts it, "good design is design that's in service of the
       experience." As a result, the TED experience for iOS7 feels
       lighter, airier - yet familiar," says Thaniya Keereepart, the
       in-house product development lead for the app.
    8. Pandoraipad

[54]Pandora
       Pandora released a new iOS 7 version of its iPhone app and a
       compleately redesigned iPad app Wednesday.
       "We've taken all of the things that we've learned about the lean-in
       experience about Pandora on the web and our phone applications, and
       brought that the tablet with a new user experience built from the
       ground up around the larger screen environment of the tablet,"
       Pandora CTO Tom Conrad told Mashable.
       Optimized for larger screens, the app makes it easy to add variety
       to a station with artist suggestion, helps you explore more about
       an artist or album on screen while you listen, and provides a
       detailed timeline customized for each individual listener. Social
       sharing also comes to the iPad for the first time with the release,
       giving users the opportunity to publish their music activity to
       Facebook, or share links to their favorite stations on Twitter.
