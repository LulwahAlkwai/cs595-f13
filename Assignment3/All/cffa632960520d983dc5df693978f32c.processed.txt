   Are Apple Fans Gullible? You betcha! The new iPhone 5S tastes like
   chocolate. OMG
   OK this is actually pretty funny Jimmy Kimmel does this regularly and
   it really does point to how gullible we are. In this case he had his
   folks wonder around and present the iPad Mini as an iPhone 5S. The S
   stands for "shut up and give us your money". The black one is in honor
   of Nelson Mandela and if you lick it, it tastes like chocolate, yes
   folks believed that and tasted chocolate. Remember all those taste
   tests? Well this pretty much showcases why they are crap. Video on the
   Huffington Post:
