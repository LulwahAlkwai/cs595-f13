Event Details

   Design & Build Weekend

   About the Evernote/Honda Hackathon: Design & Build Weekend Hackathon
   Are you a software engineer, web developer or graphic designer? Are you
   a marketer, or startup enthusiast?
   Come spend 24 hours to build a mobile app, web site or project that
   will make life better with the Honda API & Evernote API.
   It's a weekend of hacking where you can think up ideas, pitch concepts
   to each other, join into teams to quickly build as much as you can, and
   present the results.
   It's a great way for you to make new connections, learn skills, and get
   feedback from mentors and your peers. It will be a creative, supportive
   environment - OK, maybe just a little bit competitive too. Bring your
   energy and enthusiasm and let's build together.
   During the weekend we will have experienced mentors and speakers on
   hand to help you with key technologies and the Evernote API. On Sunday
   everyone will demo to each other and will get feedback from an expert
   panel. After voting by the judges, and by all of you, we will celebrate
   with some fun prizes.
   Many past hackathons have led to student teams forming start ups of
   their own -- we hope to see you join that notable list!

   Intelligent Design & Hardware Hacks

   Leap Motion

   Evernote users have stored billions of notes in their accounts for the
   last 6+ years. The API team at Evernote loves to feature developers who
   build new ways for exploring notes and helping our 50+ million users
   get more out of Evernote.

   When it comes to the future of the user interface, we are thrilled to
   include [14]Leap Motion for the Design & Build Weekend! We will be
   challenging design and dev teams to envision hand and gesture control
   of notes. This could include recipe book flipping, fast sorting,
   notebook stack visualization, and more.

   The best app that uses Leap Motion and Evernote will receive Leap
   Motion devices and the possibility of being featured in their new app
   store, [15]Air Space. [16]Explore the Devcup forum for Leap Motion app
   ideas »


   Pebble

   Pebble, one of the early trailblazers in the era of wearable
   technology, is the first smartwatch built for the 21st Century.
   Connecting wirelessly to Android and iOS smartphones via Bluetooth, the
   Pebble Smartwatch brings an high resolution e-paper display to your
   wrist, displaying notifications and information directly from a mobile
   device.

   But the true power of Pebble will come from apps. Track your speed,
   distance, and pace data with a cycling or running app that delivers
   information to the watchface, or pause and skip tracks on your phone's
   music app with the touch of a button. The Pebble SDK is versatile and
   ready for developers to build with it.

   At the Hackathon, Pebble will provide support for all the teams working
   with their SDK, and the top three teams will win a device to continue
   their development. Winning teams will be automatically entered into
   Devcup and will win watches for the entire team as well as a chance to
   win Devcup Gold.


   NODE Sensor

   [17]NODE is a wireless sensor platform that can measure anything from
   movement and color to gasses, depending on the interchangeable sensors.
   Node began on Kickstarter in 2012 and has since added many new sensors
   including the CHROMA that allows for accurate color scanning,
   previously only available with expensive spectrometers. The CHROMA
   brings color matching for paints or fabrics to your smart device and is
   a must have for contractors, artists and interior architects. Check out
   [18]nodesensors.com to learn more about the NODE platform. There are
   countless ways users can create a collection of data in Evernote with
   Node to help them understand more about the world around them. Can you
   bring the power of mobile sensors to Evernote?

   Every team that develops a working NODE app can keep their NODE, will
   be featured on the NODE website and will get a free ticket to the
   upcoming NODEVCON.

   How to Sign Up
   Help us get the right mix of participants by picking the right ticket:
   if you can code, pick the developer/engineer ticket. Can you do HTML or
   visual design but not code? Pick the designer/UX ticket. Content
   developer, marketer or startup enthusiast? Pick "Ideas / Other". There
   is no charge to attend but we can only fit a limited number of people
   so sign up early.
   The event will be held in Evernote HQ in Redwood City, CA. You will
   need to be there on Friday evening for the kickoff night. Bring your
   ideas and we will help everyone form teams. Hack on your project
   starting that Saturday morning and over the weekend and show your demo
   on Sunday.
   Plenty of food and refreshments will be provided on Saturday and
   Sunday, just bring your own computer.
