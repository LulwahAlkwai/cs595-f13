   The Internet and all those who care about Aaron took a big step forward
   today: Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Sen. Ron Wyden just introduced "Aaron's
   Law", which would fix some of the worst parts of the Computer Fraud and
   Abuse Act, including those which make it a potential crime to violate
   terms of service agreements -- that fine print that nobody reads at the
   bottom of a website.

   Add your name at right to list yourself as a "citizen cosponsor" of
   Aaron's Law, and we'll also let your lawmakers know that you want them
   to cosponsor the bill.

   The CFAA is the law under which Aaron Swartz and other innovators and
   activists have been threatened with decades in prison. It is so broad
   that law enforcement says it criminalizes all sorts of mundane Internet
   use: Potentially even breaking a website's fine print terms of service
   agreement. Don't set up a Myspace page for your cat. Don't fudge your
   height on a dating site. Don't share your Facebook password with
   anybody: You could be committing a federal crime. (Read more [11]here.)
