[75]Genius 13-Year-Old Has a Solar Power Breakthrough

   [original.png]

   When I was 13 I was smoking cigarettes I'd found on the ground and
   playing Super Nintendo like it was my life's work. This kid discovered
   a way to draw 20-50% more power from solar cells. He is way cooler.

   7th grader [76]Aidan Dwyer was walking in the woods during the winter,
   and looking up, he noticed something about the bare branches above him.
   They didn't appear to be growing randomly. So he took some measurements
   of the angles of the branches, crunched some numbers, and wouldn't you
   know it, he found that the ubiquitous [77]Fibonacci Sequence was behind
   it all. He suspected there was a reason behind this. That trees were
   using this pattern to gather more light.

   So he did an experiment. Using the same number of solar cells, he built
   two working models. One was a traditional, flat array will all of the
   panels on a single plane. The other used the Fibonacci Sequence to
   create the same spiraled pattern he observed in the trees. The results?
   The little man himself reports:

     The tree design made 20% more electricity and collected 2 1/2 more
     hours of sunlight during the day. But the most interesting results
     were in December, when the Sun was at its lowest point in the sky.
     The tree design made 50% more electricity, and the collection time
     of sunlight was up to 50% longer!"

   Genius 13-Year-Old Has a Solar Power Breakthrough S

   Did you hear that? All of the smart-guys in the country who spent their
   time trying to make solar power more efficient were just outsmarted by
   a thirteen-year-old and a tree. You can read Aiden's extremely
   well-written [78]full-report here. Aiden just won the Young Naturalist
   Award from the American Museum of Natural History. It's kids like this
   that make me think that just maaaaaybe this country isn't so screwed
   after all. [[79]American Museum of Natural History via [80]Inhabitat]

   Update: Controversy! So, [81]over the weekend a blogger posted a
   sometime that supposedly debunked Aiden's design. Here are a couple
   points to consider:

   The debunking blogger in question removed his post very shortly after
   he posted it. Why, we don't know, though I suspect he found
   inaccuracies in his own post. For one, I noticed that he didn't take
   into account the fact that Aiden's design collected 2.5 hours more
   sunlight in October and 50% more in December. Anyway, sites have been
   posting corrections left and right, but everyone has been linking to
   Google's webcache of the old post, which seems weird to me. We've
   reached out to the blogger in question and to some other experts in the
   field, and we'll update if there's anything worth mentioning.

   In the meantime, I would remind some commenters that this is a
   13-year-old we're talking about here. Whether or not you agree with his
   findings, please don't be a dick. Thanks.
