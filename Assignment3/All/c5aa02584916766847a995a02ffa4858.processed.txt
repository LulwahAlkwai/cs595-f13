Stick a candle on it: Chrome turns 5

   Google's browser celebrates its 5th Chrome-iversary, now a driving
   force behind cutting edge Web innovation that commands around 17
   percent of the global market, and Chrome's not done with you yet.

   Not long after Google delivered its Chrome browser to an unsuspecting
   world, Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer [104]downplayed the significance.

   "Open source is interesting," he said at a Microsoft conference in
   Australia, describing WebKit, the rendering engine that Chrome was
   founded on.

   It turned out to be a lot more than merely "interesting." Google
   celebrates Chrome's five-year anniversary this week, while Ballmer just
   announced that he will be [105]departing the hot seat at Microsoft
   within a year.

   "After the first couple of weeks, people were writing us off as dead,"
   said Erik Kay, a software engineer manager who's been on the Chrome
   team since before the browser launched.

   To his credit, Ballmer wasn't alone in failing to recognize the
   significance of a product that seriously shook up a somnolent Web
   browser market. At the [109]time of Chrome's launch, Microsoft's
   much-derided but dominant Internet Explorer commanded around 72 percent
   of the market, with Mozilla's [110]Firefox holding close to 20 percent,
   [111]Safari taking just under 7 percent, and Opera and other browsers
   making up the remainder.

   Why the Web?
   Before Chrome, Google had one of the most successful, most recognized
   Web apps around: Google Search. But except for a toolbar and paying
   companies like Mozilla to make Google the default search in their
   browsers, it didn't have a product of its own to promote the Web with.

   Chrome changed that, and is now one of Google's most profitable
   products.

   "When users have been using Chrome, it tends to drive Web usage up, so
   it's display ads too, not just search ads. And it's a driver of Google
   Apps," said Sundar Pichai, the senior vice president in charge of
   Chrome, in a [112]2012 interview. Although Pichai wouldn't confirm it
   at the time, it's likely that Google's Traffic Acquisition Costs, the
   amount of revenue it must share with partners, goes down as more people
   use Chrome.

   Grabbing market share and headlines
   While Firefox had spent years slowly chipping away at IE's dominance,
   few people outside of Google expected Chrome to be a viable competitor.
   Chrome [113]rocketed to more than 1 percent of the market just a day
   after its release, according to some reports. People were excited, and
   ready for something new in the browser world. Google said that Chrome's
   focus was on speed and simplicity, and it worked.

   "We realized that for us to really drive applications, you need a great
   platform underneath, and in some cases deep integration with the
   hardware underneath," [114]said Pichai. "For us the underlying platform
   was the browser, and having a say there was very important."

   Chrome's big selling point was [115]its speed, but that wasn't enough
   to sell it initially. It [116]shed nearly two-thirds of its initial
   market share before the end of 2008. Fast and simple were good selling
   points, but people also wanted a browser that wasn't going to crash on
   them, and that could be at least somewhat extensible.

   A few months later, with [117]Chrome out of beta the browser [118]began
   a rise that could be charitably described as "meteoric." Five years on,
   its market share still increasing on the desktop but much more slowly,
   and the browser is now used [119]by nearly as many people as use
   Firefox. On the other side of the coin, Internet Explorer now sits
   around 56 percent of the market. It's doubtful that Chrome's gains are
   fully attributable to IE's losses, but many of them probably are.

   Beyond speed
   The market share shift came about because Google was able to develop a
   browser that lived up to its hype. Chrome's initial emphasis on speed
   and simplicity rarely wavered, and was soon joined by a focus on
   stability and security. Google wound up challenging assumptions in all
   four of those areas, and in the process built a browser with phenomenal
   reach.

   One feature that proved to be a game-changer was the six-week
   [120]rapid-release cycle. Browsers had been receiving major updates
   annually at best before Chrome. When Chrome launched, it was on a
   quarterly schedule, but doubling that meant that the browser updated
   security and stability fixes twice as fast.

   In mimicking a mobile app's seamless updates that just occurred without
   the user having to go download the new version, Chrome was able to
   accomplish several goals at once. Not only did it become less
   noticeable when Google shipped those pesky but important security and
   stability fixes, but fans got accustomed to regular updates, and
   Chrome's own engineers were able to focus on introducing new features
   like the private browsing "Incognito" mode, automatic page translation,
   sandboxing, Native Client, and supporting the messy and unfinished
   alphabet soup of next-generation Web technologies like HTML5, CSS3,
   newer JavaScript APIs, WebGL, and WebRTC with relative ease.

   As it stands today, Chrome is a leader in pushing for future-tech Web
   technologies, and thanks to Chrome OS, which runs the browser as the
   operating system and the Web is the only platform available, Google has
   become even more heavily invested in developing the Web to compete with
   the native code that powers proprietary OSes.

   The Web as platform -- no, really
   While developers have said for years that the Web is the platform,
   Google took that literally and in 2009 [121]transformed Chrome into an
   operating system. Suddenly, the Web was the only platform that the
   computer could run, or needed to run.

   This Web-centric approach also became the first time that Google took
   an aggressive hand in co-developing hardware, with the [122]prototype
   Chrome OS laptop Cr-48. It was a step [123]heavily cribbed from Apple's
   designs, but that wouldn't matter over time as Google expanded its
   Chromebook partner base to include Acer, HP, and Samsung, and
   [124]designing internally the high-end Pixel.

   This year, Chromebooks have [125]defied PC sales trends by grabbing 20
   to 25 percent of the sub-$300 laptop market in the US.

   Occasional tarnish on Chrome
   One of the most remarkable things about Chrome is that Google rarely
   has Google made any missteps with the browser, but that doesn't mean
   they don't exist.

   The most notorious blemish on Chrome's record was its [126]sponsored
   post campaign, which actually violated at least one of Google's own
   search engine rules.

   Marketing shenanigans aside, the browser's development has been tight.
   One unforced error is Google's decision to restrict Chrome to
   [137]Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and above. Android's
   heavily-critiqued fragmentation and the lack of Chrome by default will
   slow the browser's mobile adoption since [138]many Android users still
   have pre-Ice Cream Sandwich handsets.

   Another issue that could blow up in the years to come is that new
   technologies developed by Chrome have rarely received a warm welcome
   outside of Google. Chrome's [139]Native Client for faster and safer
   porting of native code to the Web is still used only by Chrome. The new
   Dart programming language isn't even well received by the [140]Google
   faithful themselves.

   Smaller mistakes include support for Google Gears, which was
   [141]eventually phased out in favor of HTML5. To its credit, Gears --
   for getting Web apps to work offline -- went public a year before
   Chrome debuted.

   Google was notoriously [142]slow to adopt Do Not Track, which is
   growing in importance for Web privacy advocates but hardly a major
   feature. It also makes some people uncomfortable that Google Search in
   the "Omnibox" combined search-and-URL bar sends your search result data
   to Google by default.

   Shiny future for Chrome
   Five years on, Chrome is a cross-device Google gateway, the only major
   browser available on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS. The iOS
   version, which doesn't contain the full browser stack and so is a more
   limited version of the browser, nevertheless [143]gives Google services
   a shot at making some inroads with Apple's baby.

   Google's co-development of WebKit with Apple and others ended recently
   when Google decided to fork WebKit to create its own rendering engine,
   [144]Blink. This could go a long way towards staving off the fear that
   some people had of developers coding for WebKit, instead of the Web, as
   they used to have to do with Internet Explorer's Trident engine.

   Google also just introduced an unexpected major hit, the $35
   [145]Chromecast HDMI dongle for streaming content from the Web to your
   TV. This could include Web pages, as evidenced by a recent build of
   Chrome on its Beta channel.

   But as HTML5 standards solidify and the implementation of that
   technology proceeds, the big thing to watch Chrome for will be its push
   of the Web-as-platform. Chrome Packaged Apps, which allow the Web to
   run as an app [146]independently of the browser, were introduced to
   Chrome's developer's channel [147]earlier this year. They follow the
   Native Client apps that you can get from the [148]Chrome Web Store. And
   Google will be interested in flipping those "stock Android browser"
   users over to Chrome as it brings the mobile versions of the browser
   closer to parity with the desktop versions.

   For many people, though, the final verdict simply comes down to: which
   browser do you use as your default?

   "We would've been satisfied if we had introduced enough competition to
   make all the other browsers better," said the longtime Chrome team
   member Erik Kay.

   Comparing Web browsers from five years ago to those of today, 2008 to
   2013, it's obvious that Chrome has radically altered the Web. The next
   five years could well be about Chrome radically altering your desktop.
