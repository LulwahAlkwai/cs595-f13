It's time for a new calendar...

...one that doesn't just record the things you need to do but actually helps
you do them.

Mynd Calendar is a smart, context aware app that provides you with the
information you need to be successful, so you don't have to do it all by
yourself.






Mynd is incredibly easy to set up because it works with all of the existing
calendars on your phone. Try using Mynd as your primary calendar for a week,
and discover how it helps you become more successful the more you use it.

Live Smarter and Be Prepared

The Home screen is Mynd's unique way of showing you the most critical and
interesting information about your day. It tells you at a glance all the
things you need to know to get a sense for what kind of day it's going to be.

Travel Smarter and Plan Ahead

Mynd's sophisticated algorithms finds places in the content of your calendar
events.  Mynd alerts you about when to leave for a meeting based on current
traffic conditions and launches your favorite navigation app to get you there
on time.


Network Smarter and Connect Easily

Mynd discovers the people listed in your calendar events and looks up their
LinkedIn profiles and information from your address book, so you know who
you're meeting with and how to get in touch with them.

Work Smarter and Save Time

Mynd gives you quick access to all your Evernote meeting notes, and
automatically finds and dials in to conference calls to eliminate fumbling
for access codes while you're on the go.



Try Mynd!

       - User
     * I have tried so many other organizer/calendar apps that just didn't
       suit my needs. This one is perfect! I stay on time and on task. The
       fact that it syncs with my other calendars is a great bonus!
       - User
     * Awesome app. Very helpful with commute times.
