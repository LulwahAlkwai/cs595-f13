   Forbes Smack Down: Green Car Reports Correctly Says Forbes Can't Add
   When it Comes to Tesla Superchargers #tesla
   Green Car Reports takes on Forbes this week to point out that the new
   Giant can't add. Apparently Forbes was praising Tesla for getting the
   21 new supercharges they promised up during the summer in ahead of time
   in response to a Green Car Reports article that reported a miss. Forbes
   simply counted the pre-existing chargers in their total. What's bad
   about this miss is that Forbes is a financial publication and math is
   supposed to be a strength and the article potentially increased Tesla's
   market value for work that hadn't actually been done. In addition, the
   correction can make people distrust numbers surrounding Tesla doing no
   long term favors for that company. Finally the Forbes piece suggests
   that the Green Car Reports author, who is a Tesla S Driver and a fan,
   is somehow anti Tesla. Ugly screw up. Read the Green Car Reports Forbes
   Smack Down here:
