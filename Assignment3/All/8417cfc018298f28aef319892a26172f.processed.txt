Get Carrot. Do it For the Kitten.

   [26]Software | January 29, 2013 7:01 am
   Carrot's launch screen for me this morning. Sleep is no excuse.

   Carrot's launch screen for me this morning. A family and sleep is no
   excuse.

   You want a to-do list manager that will actually help you do things?
   Forget choosing an app based on features, or design, or some grand
   productivity philosophy. Get [27]Carrot, the sadistic little app that
   will goad you to mark things off your list. It's $0.99 in the [28]iOS
   App Store.

   Carrot has been getting good press for the way it brings cleverness and
   snark to the earnest list-management space. If you don't get enough
   stuff done from your list, the app turns from light and airy to dark
   and brooding, and it starts to taunt you. Get stuff done, and it pats
   you on the back with encouraging but sarcastic comments, and other
   rewards, like trivia. As a to-list app, it's very clean, if quite
   basic.

   Carrot's personality is part [29]Siri, part [30]HAL 9000, and mostly
   [31]GlaDOS. She's very funny. But there's more to Carrot then her
   acerbic personality. There is, buried in this app, an entire narrative.

   Carrot was created by [32]Brian Mueller, who was about to start film
   school when he was waylaid by the need to help support his new family.
   He diverted his career into medical writing. But he never gave up on
   his desire to entertain. Meanwhile, he found that the to-do list
   managers he was using were too busy and too boring.

   He learned to write apps, and started work on a to-do list manager for
   himself. He wanted it to be a game.

   But Mueller noticed that while "gamification" had started to infect all
   kinds of apps, he thought that most gamified apps were paradoxically
   un-fun. "Worrying about levels and points becomes a chore," he told me.
   "And it's making developers lazy."
   Finally, Carrot is happy with me. More or less. I can tell because her
   screen is white,

   Finally, Carrot is happy with me. More or less. I can tell because her
   screen is white, and she's not torturing me by showing my tasks in
   Comic Sans.

   Games, to Mueller's mind, aren't about points. "When I play games, it's
   for the characters, writing, and personality," he said.

   That thinking begat Carrot. "Her" character and personality is just the
   start of the app. As you use it, Carrot reveals a story involving an
   orphaned kitten living in a data center, and an emerging, twisted AI
   (Carrot herself). The game and the narrative in Carrot are not just
   tacked-on in the form of points and gadgets. The app changes as you
   satisfy or disappoint it: You may find Carrot giving you nicer
   task-completion icons as you please her. Slack off and she may appear
   to lose your tasks to punish you.

   If you're of a certain mind, it's actually quite motivating. It's
   funny, and emotionally honest.

   That's because, I believe, that Mueller is an artist who knows how to
   tell a story. And by "artist," I mean a person who has created a piece
   of work based on his own internal aesthetic, not for the masses and not
   for a focus group.

   Mueller, though, is a vengeful creator. "When I started working on
   Carrot, I was worried that it might turn people off. But then I said,
   screw it, and went with it. The threat is the hook. It's almost
   impossible to not make her angry. It's for a certain type of person, a
   geeky user who's more accepting of a sadistic AI."

   The story arc in Carrot does, sadly, come to an end. Mueller told me
   how. I wish he hadn't, and I won't spoil it for you. But Mueller does
   plan to keep the story alive. He's having fun weaving the narrative and
   plans to keep extending the story to keep ahead of his user base, some
   2,000 strong in the days after launch, that are barreling towards
   Carrot's current conclusion. Even if he doesn't keep writing, the to-do
   list function will keep working, since Carrot has several hundred
   random "rewards" and "punishments" not tied to the narrative.

   I can't say I recommend app-as-story for other developers, but in a
   brutally crowded app market, there is a lesson to be learned from
   Mueller's philosophy: Don't dismiss the idea of putting real
   personality into your app. You may turn off a lot of potential users,
   but the ones who do find their way to your product could end more
   strongly attached to it. Perversely so, in fact.

       Yes! The app is great! Of course, the first thing to do is to poke
       her eyeball, just to see what happens. Can't wait to see something
       about the story, and also some commands later on.
          + http://twitter.com/Rafe Rafe Needleman
            Yeah, I did that, and it made her very mad. So I deleted
            Carrot and started from scratch. Now I'm nicer to her. But
            she's still impossible to keep happy.
     * Lola's
       I forgot how to tell Carrot to feed my kitten. Or she's being
       intentionally difficult and not even trying to recognize my
       command, because she's in a wrathful mood. Help! My kitten is
       starving. (Oh yeah, thanks for the great gift, Carrot.)
