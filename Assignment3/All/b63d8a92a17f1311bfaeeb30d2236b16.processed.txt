[40]Experts 'Convinced' Duqu Work of Stuxnet Authors 85

   Posted by [41]samzenpus on Wednesday November 16, 2011 @02:48PM
   from the two-for-one dept.
   Trailrunner7 writes "Researchers are fairly confident now that
   [42]whoever wrote the Duqu malware was also involved in developing the
   Stuxnet worm. They're also confident that they have not yet identified
   all of the individual components of Duqu, meaning that there are
   potentially some other capabilities that haven't been documented yet.
   There was a lot of speculation when Duqu first emerged about whether
   the attack was the work of the same group--still unknown--that had
   created Stuxnet and unleashed it on Iran's nuclear facilities last
   year. Some of that was centered on supposed similarities in the code
   between the two pieces of malware, but that was before many of the
   individual components of Duqu had been identified and analyzed. Now
   that the analysis and research into the Duqu malware have advanced a
   bit, researchers say they've found more evidence that points to the
   malware being the work of the Stuxnet authors or their close
   associates. 'I'm convinced it's the same group,' Costin Raiu, director
   of global research and analysis at Kaspersky Lab, who has done much of
   the analysis of Duqu, said."

       If Stuxnet is designed to prevent the total destruction of Israel

       "researchers" keep quiet about what they've found? People who mess
       with the military often find themselves six feet under (unless
       they're cremated first). I'm sorry, but I think their egos are

                 This is exactly why I always watch Fox News. They have

                 not facts. It is very convenient because the news I get

                 preconceived notions about the world. I am pretty busy,
                 especially since Skyrim was released, so I don't have
                 time to start shuffling good guys and bad guys around.

            If Stuxnet is designed to prevent the total destruction of
            Israel
            That's a big "if" you're waving around there partner.
            Stuxnet could be a weapon designed for use against Iran,
            possibly by Israel, but "designed to prevent the total
            destruction of Israel", that's pretty hyperbolic.

                 More likely, stuxnet was designed as an alternative to an
                 unpopular military action. Arab neighbors of Iran are
                 eager for Israel to "handle" the issue so they can reap
                 the benefits of an emasculated Iran without getting their
                 own hands dirty. The situation for Israel is more
                 complex; military action will galvanize anti-Israeli
                 sentiments in the ME, and Iran is not their most
                 immediate problem. BUT, neither can Iran be safely
                 ignored. Stuxnet performed its job in buying extra time
                 before Iran could finalize its nuclear program, but that
                 extra time is running out.

                 Agreed. As first poster, I wanted to get this off to a
                 rollicking start. But who else would Iran use their
                 nuclear weapons on? Europe? The U.S.? South Africa? Those
                 are even more hyperbolic.

                      Probably the same people who don't want Iran to be a

                      Arab countries stick together. Nothing could be

                                the Axis of Evil. We put a "good" or
                                "evil" label on every country, and people
                                in "evil" countries can either overthrow

            You'd expect the people to have some sense of the security

                 Do you have any reason to believe Stuxnet got in
                 "easily"? The Iranians don't know how it got there. It
                 may be the Israelis (or whoever) had an agent inject it
                 onto the Natanz network. And nobody had to "open"

            This is probably the intelligence community at work here. If
            competent (and from the signs of how well created Stuxnet and
            Duqu are, they are), people who out these things have nothing
            to fear. It would almost be an open admission of guilt to
            "make them disappear." Not to mention the risk of being
            caught. These worms have worked by subtlety and subterfuge,
            they won't stop doing that now. And that means not killing
            people. Really, the idea that intelligence agencies work
            through murder is mostly (definitely not entirely, but mostly)
            a Hollywood/ New York Times Bestseller invention. In reality,
            assassination is way to risky to happen often or be used
            lightly.
            Now, if they were leaking something like a NOC list or exact
            design documents for thermonuclear warheads, that might be a
            different story. Stuxnet, however, already did its damage.
            Duqu probably did too.

            It's not exactly a secret that Mossad and the IDF were the
            chief suspects in the creation of Stuxnet. They were even
            [216]publicizing [jpost.com] their new cyber-warfare IDF
            division not too long before Stuxnet emerged. So I doubt
            Israel considers this a big secret. In fact, they may well
            want to publicize the "Threaten us and we can blow up your
            centrifuges" message it sends.

            No.
            Malware researchers should investigate malware, regardless of
            its pedigree. The malware doesn't discriminate as to the
            computer. Duqu and Stuxnet will infect a Windows system
            regardless its location and use. That was part of the idea
            behind Stuxnet: wide initial deployment so that it would
            eventually find its way into the Iranian centrifuge system.
            The authors don't seem to care if they infect non-affiliated
            systems along the way.
            There is also no reason why the exploits being used in Duqu
            and Stuxnet, presumably by western governments, can't be
            rebranded by our more run of the mill botnet farmers and
            spammers.

            iran going to nuclear war would lead to iran's government to
            fall - a conventional war would do that as well, it's a card
            house. messing with their industrial machines only can slow
            things down though, it can't stop them.
            besides, going public with the information straight on would
            actually protect the researchers, if they're worried about
            ending up six feet under. but the real reason for going public
            is that for the researchers the value of the work is going
            public and going public with it first, so they'll get
            pageviews.
            but.. you could go on further and say that they're doing free
            r&d for duqu/stuxnet developers. it's a stretch to say that
            they're the same guys though, just based on analysing the code

       So Duqu is estimated to have infected about 50 machines. It's a
       piece of scouting software that collects and maps information, but
       doesn't attack. It doesn't even phone home yet. It's obviously not
       news because of its impact to the broad population of computers on
       the Internet.
       So what exactly is this story telling us? Panic now, because the
       Stuxnet authors are still on the loose and writing malware? Don't
       panic at all, because Duqu is obviously targeting an Enemy of the
       State (like Iran) and not generic PCs? Buy Symantec or Kaspersky
       antivirus software because their detection has gotten better since
       Stuxnet?

            Stuxnet is the first widely reported example of a digital
            attack on the infrastructure of one nation by (what is
            believed to be) another nation or nations. This is a big deal.
            This is one that is likely to be in course syllabuses 50 years
            from now. If not in the CS department then probably in the
            PoliSci department. Anything connected to Stuxnet is
            inherently interesting and potentially newsworthy.
            Any actual technical capabilities that Duqu may or may not
            have is the least interesting part of this story.
