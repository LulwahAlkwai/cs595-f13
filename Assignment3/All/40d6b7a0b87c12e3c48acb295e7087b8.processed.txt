[4]We are publishing a lot more! How will we cope?

   The number of research articles published each year grows
   exponentially. We often estimate the rate of growth to [5]between 4% to
   6% a year.

   We are publishing a lot more in Computer Science. Editors must work a
   lot harder than they used to.

   According to [6]Sakr and Alomari, the size of the database research
   community doubled in the last ten years, and so did the number of
   papers they publish. The next table shows the number of papers accepted
   by VLDB (a major venue in database research) each year.
     VLDB proceedings     number of articles
   2012                 220
   2002                 110
   1992                 58

   Journals also grow in popularity. For example, the Computer Journal has
   had to double the number of issues it publishes in less than 5 years.
     Computer Journal     number of issues
   2011                 12
   2010                 10
   2009                 8
   2008                 6

   Giving the rising costs of conferences and the cutbacks in research
   funding, we might even expect journals to grow faster than conferences.

   Growth has superlinear effects: a system with twice as many variables
   isn't merely twice as complex. Reviewers and editors have to work
   harder year after year even if their numbers increase. There is simply
   a higher coordination cost. And community sizes are limited by our
   cognitive abilities. This bound is called the [7]Dunbar number. Despite
   what Facebook would have you believe, people cannot have many more than
   150 acquaintances. So, if in the last 10 years, the number of
   researchers in your area has doubled, the number of researchers you can
   trust has probably remained the same.

   In the past, this growth has lead to fragmentation. Scholars have
   become more narrow. But there is also a cost to this greater
   specialization: many of the most important problems require a broad
   expertise. Specialization often leads to irrelevance.

   So far, we have kept disciplines from fragmenting by automating more
   and more of the peer review process. This trend is likely to continue.
   I believe that, one day soon, we will replace journal editors by
   robots. I think that Google is leading the way in this respect. For
   example, from my [8]Google Scholar profile, Google recommends recent
   research papers to me. It is irrelevant where these papers appeared, as
   long as they are likely to be useful for my work. In some sense, we are
   bypassing human beings and scaling up with the help of computers.

   The research enterprise of tomorrow will look a lot more like YouTube.
   You have millions of people crafting their content and hoping to
   attract some shred of attention. Much of the filtering and
   recommendation process is automated.

   I am not claiming that relationships between researchers will become
   less important. In some sense, they will become even more important. In
   a world where you mostly interact with strangers you cannot trust, your
   trusted friends are key to preserving your sanity.
