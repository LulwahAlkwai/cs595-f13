   If two statisticians were to lose each other in an infinite forest, the
   first thing they would do is get drunk. That way, they would walk more
   or less randomly, which would give them the best chance of finding each
   other. However, the statisticians should stay sober if they want to
   pick mushrooms. Stumbling around drunk and without purpose would reduce
   the area of exploration, and make it more likely that the seekers would
   return to the same spot, where the mushrooms are already gone.

   Such considerations belong to the statistical theory of "random walk"
   or "drunkard's walk," in which the future depends only on the present
   and not the past. Today, random walk is used to model share prices,
   molecular diffusion, neural activity, and population dynamics, among
   other processes. It is also thought to describe how "genetic drift" can
   result in a particular gene--say, for blue eye color--becoming
   prevalent in a population. Ironically, this theory, which ignores the
   past, has a rather rich history of its own. It is one of the many
   intellectual innovations dreamed up by Andrei Kolmogorov, a
   mathematician of startling breadth and ability who revolutionized the
   role of the unlikely in mathematics, while carefully negotiating the
   shifting probabilities of political and academic life in Soviet Russia.

   As a young man, Kolmogorov was nourished by the intellectual ferment of
   post-revolutionary Moscow, where literary experimentation, the artistic
   avant-garde, and radical new scientific ideas were in the air. In the
   early 1920s, as a 17-year-old history student, he presented a paper to
   a group of his peers at Moscow University, offering an unconventional
   statistical analysis of the lives of medieval Russians. It found, for
   example, that the tax levied on villages was usually a whole number,
   while taxes on individual households were often expressed as fractions.
   The paper concluded, controversially for the time, that taxes were
   imposed on whole villages and then split among the households, rather
   than imposed on households and accumulated by village. "You have found
   only one proof," was his professor's acid observation. "That is not
   enough for a historian. You need at least five proofs." At that moment,
   Kolmogorov decided to change his concentration to mathematics, where
   one proof would suffice.

   It is oddly appropriate that a chance event drove Kolmogorov into the
   arms of probability theory, which at the time was a maligned
   sub-discipline of mathematics. Pre-modern societies often viewed chance
   as an expression of the gods' will; in ancient Egypt and classical
   Greece, throwing dice was seen as a reliable method of divination and
   fortune telling. By the early 19th century, European mathematicians had
   developed techniques for calculating odds, and distilled probability to
   the ratio of the number of favorable cases to the number of all equally
   probable cases. But this approach suffered from
   circularity--probability was defined in terms of equally probable
   cases--and only worked for systems with a finite number of possible
   outcomes. It could not handle countable infinity (such as a game of
   dice with infinitely many faces) or a continuum (such as a game with a
   spherical die, where each point on the sphere represents a possible
   outcome). Attempts to grapple with such situations produced
   contradictory results, and earned probability a bad reputation.

     Pre-modern societies often viewed chance as an expression of the
     gods' will; in ancient Egypt and classical Greece, throwing dice was
     seen as a reliable method of divination and fortune telling.

   Reputation and renown were qualities that Kolmogorov prized. After
   switching his major, Kolmogorov was initially drawn into the devoted
   mathematical circle surrounding Nikolai Luzin, a charismatic teacher at
   Moscow University. Luzin's disciples nicknamed the group "Luzitania," a
   pun on their professor's name and the famous British ship that had sunk
   in the First World War. They were united by a "joint beating of
   hearts," as Kolmogorov described it, gathering after class to exalt or
   eviscerate new mathematical innovations. They mocked partial
   differential equations as "partial irreverential equations" and finite
   differences as "fine night differences." The theory of probability,
   lacking solid theoretical foundations and burdened with paradoxes, was
   jokingly called the "theory of misfortune."

   It was through Luzitania that Kolmogorov's evaluation of probability
   took on a more personal turn. By the 1930s, the onset of Stalinist
   terror meant anyone could expect a nighttime knock on the door by the
   secret police, and blind chance seemed to rule people's lives.
   Paralyzed by fear, many Russians felt compelled to participate in
   denunciations, hoping to increase their chance of survival. Bolshevik
   activists among the mathematicians, including Luzin's former students,
   accused Luzin of political disloyalty and castigated him for publishing
   in foreign countries. Kolmogorov, having published abroad himself, may
   have realized his own vulnerability. He had already displayed an
   apparent readiness to make political compromises for the sake of his
   career, accepting a position as a research institute director when his
   predecessor was imprisoned by the Bolshevik regime for supporting
   religious freedom. Now Kolmogorov joined the critics and turned against
   Luzin. Luzin was subject to a show trial by the Academy of Sciences and
   lost all official positions, but surprisingly escaped being arrested
   and shot by the Russian authorities. Luzitania was gone, sunk by its
   own crew.

   The moral dimension of Kolmogorov's decision aside, he had played the
   odds successfully and gained the freedom to continue his work. In the
   face of his own political conformity, Kolmogorov presented a radical
   and, ultimately, foundational revision of probability theory. He relied
   on measure theory, a fashionable import to Russia from France. Measure
   theory represented a generalization of the ideas of "length," "area,"
   or "volume," allowing the measure of various weird mathematical objects
   to be taken when conventional means did not suffice. For example, it
   could help calculate the area of a square, with an infinite number of
   holes in it, cut it into an infinite number of pieces, and scattered
   over an infinite plane. In measure theory, it is still possible to
   speak of the "area" (measure) of this scattered object.

     The theory of probability, lacking solid theoretical foundations and
     burdened with paradoxes, was jokingly called the "theory of
     misfortune."

   Kolmogorov drew analogies between probability and measure, resulting in
   five axioms, now usually formulated in six statements, that made
   probability a respectable part of mathematical analysis. The most basic
   notion of Kolmogorov's theory was the "elementary event," the outcome
   of a single experiment, like tossing a coin. All elementary events
   formed a "sample space," the set of all possible outcomes. For
   lightning strikes in Massachusetts, for example, the sample space would
   consist of all the points in the state where lightning could hit. A
   random event was defined as a "measurable set" in a sample space, and
   the probability of a random event as the "measure" of this set. For
   example, the probability that lightning would hit Boston would depend
   only on the area ("measure") of this city. Two events occurring
   simultaneously could be represented by the intersection of their
   measures; conditional probabilities by dividing measures; and the
   probability that one of two incompatible events would occur by adding
   measures (that is, the probability that either Boston or Cambridge
   would be hit by lightning equals the sum of their areas).

   The Paradox of the Great Circle was a major mathematical conundrum that
   Kolmogorov's conception of probability finally put to rest. Assume
   aliens landed randomly on a perfectly spherical Earth and the
   probability of their landing was equally distributed. Does this mean
   that they would be equally likely to land anywhere along any circle
   that divides the sphere into two equal hemispheres, known as a "great
   circle?" It turns out that the landing probability is equally
   distributed along the equator, but is unevenly distributed along the
   meridians, with the probability increasing toward the equator and
   decreasing at the poles. In other words, the aliens would tend to land
   in hotter climates. This strange finding might be explained by the
   circles of latitude getting bigger as they get closer to the
   equator--yet this result seems absurd, since we can rotate the sphere
   and turn its equator into a meridian. Kolmogorov showed that the great
   circle has a measure zero, since it is a line segment and its area is
   zero. This explains the apparent contradiction in conditional landing
   probabilities by showing that these probabilities could not be
   rigorously calculated.

   Having crossed from the very real world of Stalinist purges into the
   ephemeral zone of zero-measure conditional probabilities, Kolmogorov
   was soon plunged back into reality. During the Second World War, the
   Russian government asked Kolmogorov to develop methods for increasing
   the effectiveness of artillery fire. He showed that, instead of trying
   to maximize the probability of each shot hitting its target, in certain
   cases it would be better to fire a fusillade with small deviations from
   perfect aim, a tactic known as "artificial dispersion." The Moscow
   University Department of Probability Theory, of which he had become the
   head, also calculated ballistic tables for low-altitude, low-speed
   bombing. In 1944 and 1945, the government awarded Kolmogorov two Orders
   of Lenin for his wartime contributions, and after the war, he served as
   a mathematics consultant for the thermonuclear weapons program.

   But Kolmogorov's interests inclined him in more philosophical
   directions, too. Mathematics had led him to believe that the world was
   both driven by chance and fundamentally ordered according to the laws
   of probability. He often reflected on the role of the unlikely in human
   affairs. Kolmogorov's chance meeting with fellow mathematician Pavel
   Alexandrov on a canoeing trip in 1929 began an intimate, lifelong
   friendship. In one of the long, frank letters they exchanged,
   Alexandrov chastised Kolmogorov for the latter's interest in talking to
   strangers on the train, implying that such encounters were too
   superficial to offer insight into a person's real character. Kolmogorov
   objected, taking a radical probabilistic view of social interactions in
   which people acted as statistical samples of larger groups. "An
   individual tends to absorb the surrounding spirit and to radiate the
   acquired lifestyle and worldview to anyone around, not just to a select
   friend," he wrote back to Alexandrov.

     Mathematics had led him to believe that the world was both driven by
     chance and fundamentally ordered according to the laws of
     probability.

   Music and literature were deeply important to Kolmogorov, who believed
   he could analyze them probabilistically to gain insight into the inner
   workings of the human mind. He was a cultural elitist who believed in a
   hierarchy of artistic values. At the pinnacle were the writings of
   Goethe, Pushkin, and Thomas Mann, alongside the compositions of Bach,
   Vivaldi, Mozart, and Beethoven--works whose enduring value resembled
   eternal mathematical truths. Kolmogorov stressed that every true work
   of art was a unique creation, something unlikely by definition,
   something outside the realm of simple statistical regularity. "Is it
   possible to include [Tolstoy's War and Peace] in a reasonable way into
   the set of `all possible novels' and further to postulate the existence
   of a certain probability distribution in this set?" he asked,
   sarcastically, in a 1965 article.

   Yet he longed to find the key to understanding the nature of artistic
   creativity. In 1960 Kolmogorov armed a group of researchers with
   electromechanical calculators and charged them with the task of
   calculating the rhythmical structures of Russian poetry. Kolmogorov was
   particularly interested in the deviation of actual rhythms from
   classical meters. In traditional poetics, the iambic meter is a rhythm
   consisting of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable.
   But in practice, this rule is rarely obeyed. In Pushkin's Eugene
   Onegin, the most famous classical iambic poem in the Russian language,
   almost three-fourths of its 5,300 lines violate the definition of the
   iambic meter, and more than a fifth of all even syllables are
   unstressed. Kolmogorov believed that the frequency of stress deviation
   from the classical meters offered an objective "statistical portrait"
   of a poet. An unlikely pattern of stresses, he thought, indicated
   artistic inventiveness and expression. Studying Pushkin, Pasternak, and
   other Russian poets, Kolmogorov argued that they had manipulated meters
   to give "general coloration" to their poems or passages.

     Music and literature were deeply important to Kolmogorov, who
     believed he could analyze them probabilistically to gain insight
     into the inner workings of the human mind.

   To measure the artistic merit of texts, Kolmogorov also employed a
   letter-guessing method to evaluate the entropy of natural language. In
   information theory, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or
   unpredictability, corresponding to the information content of a
   message: the more unpredictable the message, the more information it
   carries. Kolmogorov turned entropy into a measure of artistic
   originality. His group conducted a series of experiments, showing
   volunteers a fragment of Russian prose or poetry and asking them to
   guess the next letter, then the next, and so on. Kolmogorov privately
   remarked that, from the viewpoint of information theory, Soviet
   newspapers were less informative than poetry, since political discourse
   employed a large number of stock phrases and was highly predictable in
   its content. The verses of great poets, on the other hand, were much
   more difficult to predict, despite the strict limitations imposed on
   them by the poetic form. According to Kolmogorov, this was a mark of
   their originality. True art was unlikely, a quality probability theory
   could help to measure.

   Kolmogorov scorned the idea of placing War and Peace in a probabilistic
   sample space of all novels--but he could express its unpredictability
   by calculating its complexity. Kolmogorov conceived complexity as the
   length of the shortest description of an object, or the length of an
   algorithm that produces an object. Deterministic objects are simple, in
   the sense that they can by produced by a short algorithm: say, a
   periodic sequence of zeroes and ones. Truly random, unpredictable
   objects are complex: any algorithm reproducing them would have to be as
   long as the objects themselves. For example, irrational numbers--those
   that cannot be written as fractions-- almost surely have no pattern in
   the numbers that appear after the decimal point. Therefore, most
   irrational numbers are complex objects, because they can be reproduced
   only by writing out the actual sequence. This understanding of
   complexity fits with the intuitive notion that there is no method or
   algorithm that could predict random objects. It is now crucial as a
   measure of the computational resources necessary to specify an object,
   and finds multiple applications in modern-day network routing, sorting
   algorithms, and data compression.

   By Kolmogorov's own measure, his life was a complex one.  By the time
   he died, in 1987 at the age of 84, he had not only weathered a
   revolution, two World Wars, and the Cold War, but his innovations left
   few mathematical fields untouched, and extended well beyond the
   confines of academe. Whether his random walk through life was of the
   inebriated or mushroom-picking variety, its twists and turns were
   neither particularly predictable nor easily described. His success at
   capturing and applying the unlikely had rehabilitated probability
   theory, and had created a terra firma for countless scientific and
   engineering projects. But his theory also amplified the tension between
   human intuition about unpredictability and the apparent power of the
   mathematical apparatus to describe it.

   For Kolmogorov, his ideas neither eliminated chance, nor affirmed a
   fundamental uncertainty about our world; they simply provided a
   rigorous language to talk about what cannot be known for certain. The
   notion of "absolute randomness" made no more sense than "absolute
   determinism," he once remarked, concluding, "We can't have positive
   knowledge of the existence of the unknowable." Thanks to Kolmogorov,
   though, we can explain when and why we don't.
