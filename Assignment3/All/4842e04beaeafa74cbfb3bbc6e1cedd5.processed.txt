                 [19]Chrome's insane password security strategy

   Aug 6, 2013

   Chrome does something interesting when you first run it.

   import

   The other day, I was using Chrome in development for an Ember.js app. I
   use Safari for day-to-day browsing, but it has a habit of aggressively
   caching files when I least expect it, so from time to time I switch to
   Chrome.

   I decided to hit Chrome's "Import bookmarks now" link and see whether I
   could import my bookmarklets from Safari, so things would be nice and
   consistent between the two browsers. I didn't expect this:

   Chrome asking me to import my content from Safari

   This struck me as particularly odd. Why is "Saved passwords" greyed
   out, and mandatory? Why have a check-box? This is the illusion of
   choice. I think it's deeply misleading, and this is why:

   This is a page in Chrome's settings panel:

   Passwords in Chrome

   See that "show" button? It does what you think it does.

   Passwords in Chrome, in plain-text

   There's no master password, no security, not even a prompt that "these
   passwords are visible". Visit chrome://settings/passwords in Chrome if
   you don't believe me.

   There are two sides to this. The developer's side, and the user's side.
   Both roles have vastly different opinions as to how the computer works.
   Any time I try to draw attention to this, I get the usual responses
   from technical people:
     * Just use 1Pass
     * The computer is already insecure as soon as you have physical
       access
     * That's just how password management works

   While all of these points are valid, this doesn't address the real
   problem: Google isn't clear about its password security.

   In a world where Google promotes its browser on YouTube, in cinema
   pre-rolls, and on billboards, the clear audience is not developers.
   It's the mass market - the users. The overwhelming majority. They don't
   know it works like this. They don't expect it to be this easy to see
   their passwords. Every day, millions of normal, every-day users are
   saving their passwords in Chrome. This is not okay.

   "A Google Chrome prompt showing the words 'confidential information',
   and 'in your keychain'

   This dialog is even more misleading. By using words like "confidential
   information" and "stored in your keychain", OSX describes the state of
   your saved password's current security. It's the very security Chrome
   is about to bypass, by displaying your passwords, in plain-text,
   outside your keychain, without requiring a password. When you visit a
   website, Chrome prompts for every password it can find for that domain.

   Today, go up to somebody non-technical. Ask to borrow their computer.
   Visit chrome://settings/passwords and click "show" on a few of the
   rows. See what they have to say.

   I bet you it won't be "That's how password management works".

   Updates:

   [20]Justin Schuh who is head of Chrome security and called me "a
   novice", says I'm wrong, and that [21]this is not going to change.

   [22]Sir Tim Berners-Lee is with me. Is there a higher authority?

   [23]This is Google's page on "saving passwords". Nothing about this
   feature. Why?
