What Makes a Powerful Purpose?

   I think there's no longer a question about whether it's a good practice
   for a business to articulate a clear purpose. The question now is what
   makes a good purpose.

   Dan Pink has become well known with his research concluding that
   purpose, in the sense of achieving a greater social good, is a huge
   motivator of employees. And Simon Sinek's popular Ted Talk says we
   should focus on the "why" of our business rather than the "what"
   because customers are motivated to purchase and employees are motivated
   to perform based on your answer to why you do what you do. But does
   every business leader's answer to "why" make a good purpose?

   I once worked for a large trucking company that had a practice of
   sharing profits with employees through a generous bonus structure.
   There were three major divisions, and I remember one occasion where all
   employees were invited to hear the three leaders speak. They all
   covered the normal rhetoric on their strategy and financials, but their
   differentiation was in their explanation of why employees should be
   motivated. The first leader tried to pump us up by saying "let's all
   work really hard and take home big bonus checks". His words fell flat.
   The second one said "if we work really hard we'll be rewarded with
   financial security". He didn't get too much reaction. The third said "I
   want everyone in this company (most of whom were blue collar truckers)
   to experience the American dream". When he said this, you could feel
   the energy in the room shift. He evoked deep emotion in us, most of
   whom have ancestors who left their homes and came to this country (USA)
   sparked by a dream for a better life. We were ready to bend over
   backwards to help this guy be successful.

   All three leaders used the same theme of financial rewards for
   employees, but only one hit the mark. And this is, of course, only one
   theme that can be inspirational. What is the key?

   Defining a powerful purpose reminds me of the Five Whys used in process
   improvement. With this technique, you ask why a problem occurred, and
   when you get an answer, you ask why that occurred. You keep going until
   you get to the root cause of the problem. Using this technique in
   getting to a meaningful purpose, continue to ask why until you feel the
   answer in your heart. Why are big bonus checks important, because they
   provide some financial satisfaction. Why is financial satisfaction
   important, because it's key to the American dream. When your answer
   strikes heartfelt emotion, you have arrived.

   When a leader feels heartfelt emotion about a purpose, the emotion is
   infectious in the organization. Positive, heartfelt emotion does more
   than just inspire greater performance. It also creates an environment
   in which employees are [19]sharper and more creative.

   As elementary as this may sound, in order for leaders to arrive at a
   purpose that inspires the heart, the person doing the asking has to be
   able to detect heartfelt emotion. Lots of business people stay stuck in
   their heads and can't do this. If you're one of these people, become
   more aware of your heart by imagining your breath flowing into and out
   of your heart region. For most people, this will eventually evoke a
   warm tingling in the area of the heart. It's this same tingling warmth
   that will be activated by an inspiring purpose.

   It's important to understand that when a particular purpose strikes the
   heart of one person, it doesn't necessarily strike the heart of
   everyone. The Vice Chairman of Philip Morris, the large tobacco
   company, said in 1979, "I love cigarettes. It's one of the things that
   makes life really worth living." This formed the core of the company's
   purpose, and sparked them to be the leader in their industry for many
   decades.  Lots of people would say this purpose doesn't resonate with
   their heart, yet it worked for Philip Morris. Of course, if they had
   used the Five Whys, they may have reached a deeper purpose such as "to
   help preserve personal freedom of choice" that would have resonated
   with even more people.

   As we learn more from neuroscience about the incredible power of group
   emotions, we see reasons to adopt techniques beyond the ordinary. For
   more on shaping team emotions to increase creativity and performance,

       Jackie,
       Your blog hits the heart of the matter. When activity, the doing of
       life, is all we focus on, it is flat, automaton behavior, devoid on
       anything but Activity energy. When we act from a sense of purpose,
       when our activity emanates from the deeper Context of our lives it
       is imbued with another type of energy, often called passion. And
       this energy is infectious and sustaining through all the struggles
       we may face.
       I also agree that traveling the "Why" ladder can bring one down to
       that point of knowing one's (or an organization's) purpose. Another
       process I use is to ask what I call the "It's A Wonderful Life"
       question. LIke in the movie "It's A Wonderful LIfe one can explore
       the question of what would the world be missing if we didn't exist.

       Thanks Jackie - your posts and thinking are always a couple of
       steps ahead of the curve and this one is no different. You are
       already leading us on `let's make this mainstream'. Thanks for
       this. I really resonated with "continue to ask why until you feel
       the answer in your heart." Having just finished working with some
       leaders today, we could feel in the room that those connected to
       the `why' purpose of why their teams should follow their purpose
       had a far greater chance of impacting other and creating higher
       performance in their teams.

       Great article Jackie. In my current contract, i am present to how
       many workers are just working to pay the bills and get to friday
       and I noticed how attached I am to `making them connect to a higher
       purpose'. Maybe that purpose is what works for them but it does not
       seem to generate the kind of performance mindset that would create
       creative problem solving on some of our very big business risk
       areas. Any ideas/comments?

    4. Jackie Barretta  July 17, 2012
       Kate, I think it's human nature to want to attach to a higher
       purpose, but lots of people have given up on it over time because
       it's so hard to find in business.I'm glad to hear that the
       Millenial generation has a strong need to connect to a higher
       purpose (I hear that from lots of sources), and I hope they'll
       never give up on it. One thing I had in mind but probably didn't
       highlight enough in the article is that when people feel heartfelt
       emotions, they're more creative. HeartMath has published lots of
       scientific discovery on that. So I believe that creating
       environments with heartfelt emotion, including heartfelt purposes,
       is key to solving our biggest challenges in business.

       Jackie,
       Thanks for the opportunity to clarify and tighten my point.
       At the level of the individual, a powerful purpose must certainly
       be heartfelt. Choosing a private school for my children to fulfill
       the powerful purpose of starting them on a successful life path is
       a very heartfelt example for me. However at the level of
       organization, the school itself may be committed to my individual
       purpose but they have policies, procedures, payroll, local business
       supporters and competitors, political interests, etc. They hire
       janitors and accountants that will never meet my children.
       Therefore a business does not require strict individual alignment
       to a purpose to the extent it needs to manage the conversation that
       the business itself is in the many worlds where it must succeed.
       All the inputs, heartfelt or otherwise, need a lighthouse beacon to
       get their bearing. From there the principles of Tribal Leadership
       help an organization to move across the gap from where they are to
       where they are committed to being as a collective.

       A very good article Jackie. It certainly gets you thinking! I
       personally think that people are more aware these days and will,
       either consciously or unconsciously, be looking for integrity and
       honesty. Whether that be in a statement of purpose or any other
       activity that impacts on their life. Bringing people together in a
       positive environment and asking them to interact and give something
       of themselves, must surely be more attainable if the speaker or the
       business in question, speaks from the heart. People are looking for
       something deeper these days and won`t be fooled by `pretenders`
       anymore.

       I've worked in mainly in construction, so my perspective comes from
       that mindset! I found that most people were inspired by a call to
       serve the company! A sense that the company depended on them and
       that they could make the difference. A threat of competition
       winning the work also helped, but certainly a sense of urgency
       seemed to rally company "patriotism"! In a large company I worked
       for in the 80's, there was a bonus system that created Leading
       Hands to operate like small business owners! Whilst it was a highly
       efficient and lucrative scheme at times, it created animosity,
       backstabbing and infighting! It wasn't a pleasant environment to be
       in at all!
       I think what @Sandra said was great, people want people who will
       share their experience with them and be a part of the solution with
       them. I remember having to do a dangerous job once, I had to walk
       on a cable tray in the roof! I felt jittery about it! The business
       owner sensing this got up in the ceiling and did what he was asking
       me to do! It was inspiring! It was leadership and let me know that
       I had someone who understood where I was at and was willing,
       themselves to risk themselves and show the way through!

       Jackie, I am so glad I found you! We speak the same language, with
       similar contexts. Having a purpose for an organization about which
       the stakeholders are passionate is about the single most powerful
       energy source possible. There's an allegory I retold in a brief
       blog post which illustrates this nicely. I hope it's OK to post the
       link here:

       Hi Jackie, Thank you for this text. I can't agree more. From my
       experience as a Coach and Trainer, I can feel how much this purpose
       is missing today.
       For most companies the mission statement is only words on a paper.
       People don't believe and don't trust their leaders anymore.

       Great discussion, Jackie, thanks so much for sharing. In the
       ages-old health/wellness philosophy that I teach and endeavor to
       follow, answering the question, "what makes a powerful purpose,"
       can be first and foremost answered with the following: Acting
       Without Acting, i.e., doing the right thing for the right
       sake...without the need for selfish recognition or hidden agendas.
       Accordingly, nothing is more powerful than a `purpose' which is
       rooted in this wonderfully healthful and selfless approach.

       Having a purpose provides the driver to gain the results. Without a
       real purpose focus is lost & success tends to be overlooked. The
       secret to having a purpose, often called the "why" has greater
       strength when linked to passion or within the emotional connection
       to the overall goal. Business is logical however, the person that
       runs it still is driven by passion & creativity. Add the reason for
       this to work in synergy success becomes a great by-product.
