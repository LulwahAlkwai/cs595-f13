Blog Debunks 13-Year-Old Scientist's Solar Power Breakthrough

   By [3]Ujala Sehgal   |   Aug 20, 2011

   A 13-year-old who, observing trees, takes it upon himself to read up on
   the Fibonacci series and propose a way to better utilize solar energy
   is the feel-good story at its finest. So naturally, media outlets
   [4]including us have been sharing the tale of seventh grader Aidan
   Dwyer's solar power "breakthrough" science project. But [5]according to
   the blog [6]The Capacity Factor, the media has been getting way ahead
   of itself.

   In short, here is the story of young Dwyer's science finding: He was
   observing trees, and noticed how the branches held a spiral pattern,
   and wondered what would be the use of that. Looking at the Fibonacci
   series, which describes spirals, he also noticed that tree leaves
   adhered to the spiral sequence. This led him to propose arranging solar
   panels like oak trees leaves, a manner which would be 20 to 50 percent
   more efficient, energy-wise. The American Museum of Natural History
   rewarded him with a Young Naturalist award.

   So far, so great. But The Capacity Factor, clearly unhappy with its
   role of the Grinch who must squash an adolescent's science discovery,
   has written a [7]post called "In which hopelessly inept journalists
   reduce me to having to debunk a school science project." (The post as
   of this moment is temporarily unavailable, though we link to the
   cache.) The post indicates about Dwyer's discovery: "This is, I'm sad
   to say, clear nonsense. I'll take this in two parts: one, why his
   experiment is, unfortunately, completely broken (sorry again). Two, why
   the imagined result is impossible nonsense."

   Part one: "Broken Experiment."

     Most importantly, by mistake he did not measure power outputs from
     the solar cells. Instead he measured voltage, without a load
     attached ("open circuit"). They are barely related -- in solar
     cells, voltage is actually almost a constant, independent of power.

   Demonstrating the difference with a series of equations and graphs, it
   comes to this conclusion: "End result: measuring the solar cells'
   [open-circuit voltage] over time, and adding them up, is garbage data,
   and has nothing to do with energy production."

   Part two: "Unreasonably Theory."

   The blog also indicates that the theory behind the discovery itself is
   problematic: "I'm not sure I understand the confusion by which people
   think there could be some advantage, to orienting panels at sub-optimal
   angles. That somehow combining sub-optimal panels, together, makes them
   generate more energy in the net." It then goes to demonstrate via
   equations that "if the individual angles in the 'tree' are worse then
   the 45°-tilted south-facing panels in the flat array (they obviously
   are), so is their combination."

   Finger-pointing: It's not the seventh grader's fault, it's the media's
   fault.

   The blog does not blame the seventh grader for imperfect science, but
   actually the news media for blowing up this story and putting a
   13-year-old into the spotlight for an impressively ambitious but
   unfortunately incorrect claim. It ends with this open question: "How
   did this confused science project became international news?"

   If there's any further scientific analysis that should be taken into
   account here, please let us know.
