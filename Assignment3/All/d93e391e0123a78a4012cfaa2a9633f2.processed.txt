   What's This?

   Mashable Op-Ed

   This post reflects the opinions of the author and not necessarily those
   of Mashable as a publication.

   Apple's iPhone 5S and 5C unveiling was perfectly executed, but not
   transcendent, and I'm OK with that.

   I'm not going to lie to you; I was actually somewhat relieved that
   [48]Apple only introduced two products on Tuesday. Not that I wouldn't
   have loved to see more, but when you're doing the sprint also known as
   [49]live blog, you cherish the finish line almost as much as the
   product deets. So thank you, Apple, for that.

   On the other hand ... Just two products and one of them is essentially
   a very smart and colorful reskinning of a previous product? Color me
   surprised.

   Apple's new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were widely anticipated, which
   meant that surprises, if there were any, would come from a third thing.
   There was no third thing.

   Apple did not unveil an Apple TV update (though a software overhaul
   [51]is rumored for next week). The company did not reveal either an
   Apple HDTV or a wearable device. I really didn't expect them to. Even
   so, there was that moment when I thought, "Wait, that's it?"

   Even as Elvis Costello wrapped up with his three- (or was it four?)
   song tribute to iTunes radio, I still believed Apple CEO Tim Cook might
   do a Steve Jobs "One More Thing" trick. I was wrong. Cook was done and
   ushered us out of the Town Hall and to an adjacent demo room.

   Of the two new phones, Apple's [52]iPhone 5S is the only truly new
   product. That is if you measure fresh product by new features and
   technologies. The iPhone 5S is packed with new parts and has its
   showiest new feature on its body: the Touch ID fingerprint scanner.

   Though the iPhone 5C looks all new, it's rather like Apple took an
   iPhone 5 body and wrapped it in bright, durable plastic. To be fair,
   the differences are more than skin deep. The 5C bucks Apple's recent
   trend of putting the metal and antenna on the outside and hides all of
   the metal chassis underneath its eye-catching skin.

The New Apple

   Correct me if I'm wrong, but it appears that Apple has been slowly
   shifting to this less-is-more approach: One major product and one
   minor. Not two or three majors and a minor. To be fair, all extra
   majors were usually a "One More Thing." [53]Tim Cook's Apple does as
   good a job as Apple ever did telling the story of their new technology.
   I mean, I walk out of an Apple event with a complete understanding of
   what's new and why I should (or at least Apple thinks I should) care.
   Apple remains the master in this regard.

   However, Cook's events are a lot different than Steve Jobs'. There's a
   bit less showmanship and a little less, "Let me show you." Marketing
   head [54]Phil Schiller walked us through the iPhone 5S features, but
   the experience did not feel as, well, intimate as it did when Steve
   Jobs would do it.

   Steve Jobs overworked "magical." There was, on Tuesday, no shortage of
   superlatives to describe Apple's new products. Tim Cook is particularly
   fond of "incredible." I agree with him that some of what I saw in the
   iPhone 5S deserves that description, though "magical" takes the
   sentiment to a whole other place, doesn't it?

No More Thing

   As I sat into my Town Hall chair, with Twitter founder [55]Jack Dorsey
   right [56]behind me and former Vice President Al Gore just two rows
   ahead, the realization that there would be no "one more thing" slowly
   sunk in. As it did, I finally understood that there were, in fact,
   three products at the event, though only two were new.

   Apple's brand new mobile operating system [57]iOS 7 was the one more
   thing. It was part of both the iPhone 5S and [58]iPhone 5C story. For
   the latter, it was as if Apple designed the phone bodies and mobile OS
   at the same time (which it probably did). For the former, there are
   many things you can do on the iPhone 5S that are clearly a marriage of
   hardware and software.

   iOS 7, for example, is already 64-bit ready, as are all the preloaded
   apps -- a perfect match for the 64-bit A7 CPU. Every new feature in the
   iSight camera is enabled by the iPhone 5S's new A7 chip. Without cool
   new photo features and, of course, the redesigned Photo Library
   interface, there's no way to show off the mobile CPU's image chops.
   Real-time exposure adjustment, smile recognition, burst mode, slo-mo,
   these are all CPU-intensive tasks, but without an OS to show them off,
   well, you get the picture.

   Some might argue that iTunes Radio was the "third thing." Sorry, but
   this streaming music service is part of the mobile OS and even though
   Costello was on stage to, sort of, sing its praises, it was not really
   treated as a stand-alone product at the event.

   As I see it, iOS 7 was the rest of the Apple event story. It was a
   thread that wove itself throughout and I think there's very good reason
   for that. This seventh edition is the most radical reimagining of the
   mobile OS since it was launched. iOS 7 is not just a new face, a paint
   job for a modern generation of iPhone users or even something to appeal
   to kids.

Get Over It

   I know some people are disappointed: The iPhone 5C isn't cheap enough.
   There was no "third thing." Samsung is doing more. They may be right.
   $99 is not free, there were zero surprises and Samsung's Galaxy S4
   phone watches you. On the other hand, all this criticism misses the
   point.

   As always, Apple delivered the products and innovations it believes its
   customers want. It micro-targeted the 5C at China (and price-conscious
   U.S. consumers), and moved the state of the art a bit further along,
   The decision to make, with Touch ID, security a center piece of its new
   product is telling and savvy. Security speaks to a basic human concern
   and is also has a direct connection to privacy, something that is now,
   more than ever, weighing heavily on consumers' minds. Since Apple's
   probably been working on the 5S for well over a year, it's hard to
   imagine that it really did this in response to [59]NSA-driven fears.
   Still, they are quite canny, aren't they?

   I have no doubt Apple will sell millions of iPhone 5S's and expand its
   smartphone footprint with the new iPhone 5C. Is all this enough to beat
   back Samsung? It's too soon to tell. What is clear is that Apple is not
   very interested in a tit-for-tat features battle with Samsung (or any
   other phone manufacturer). It's choosing to:
    1. Serve its base.
    2. Add features that virtually any potential iPhone customer can grasp
       and appreciate.
    3. Offer just enough variety to excite a specific - and possibly new
       -- market segment.

   Is that a winning strategy? You tell me.

Hands On With the iPhone 5S

    1. Apple-event-26

Introducing the iPhone 5S
       Apple unveiled the iPhone 5S -- along with a lower cost iPhone 5C
       -- at its Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, marking the first time
       two iPhone devices launched on the same day.
    2. Apple-event-24

iPhone 5S: Gold, Silver and Black
       The iPhone 5S -- which comes in gold, silver and black -- has the
       same overall physical design as the previous-generation iPhone 5,
       but it also has a number of upgrades.
    3. Apple-event-15

Sleek and Light
       The iPhone 5S measures in at 4.87 inches high, 2.31 inches wide and
       0.30 inches deep. It weighs less than 4 ounces -- 3.95 to be exact.
    4. Apple-event-17

Touch ID
       The iPhone 5S will include a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, allowing
       users to unlock their device with the touch of a finger.
    5. Apple-event-18

Fingerprint Sensor Technology
       Not only will this be a huge step forward in smartphone protection,
       it can also be used to make iTunes purchases. Instead of typing in
       a password every time you buy a song or app, pressing your
       fingerprint against the scanner will bypass that step.
    6. Apple-event-29

App Innovation
       Apple has re-engineered all the built-in apps -- such as Mail,
       Calendar and iPod -- for 64-bit architectures.
    7. Apple-event-14

Faster Processor
       The iPhone 5S comes with a powerful new processor: the Apple A7. It
       packs more than 1 billion transistors into a 102mm chip. It can run
       64-bit apps (all previous models ran at 32 bits).
    8. Apple-event-13

Improved Camera
       The iPhone's camera comes with major improvements, thanks to new
       sensors that have 15% more area and an f/2.2 aperture. It also
       comes with a dual-LED flash and new software features, such as
       filters and a burst mode that snaps 10 still pictures in one second
       with automatic image stabilization.
    9. Apple-event-22

Photo Collections
       Apple is making it easier to group photos and videos based on time
       and place. It's displayed almost like a mosaic on screen.
   10. Apple-event-21

Photo Sorting
       Photos can also be sorted by year.
   11. Apple-event-20

Panoramics
       The panorama feature captures a scene at an impressive 30 frames
       for each second. This is 50% faster than the iPhone 5.
   12. Apple-event-1

HD Video Recording
       The iPhone 5S lets you film in 1080p HD and touts a slow-motion
       feature at 120 frames for each second in 720p. This means you can
       take footage in regular speed and slow it down, for example, during
       a dramatic moment.
   13. Apple-event-16

iPhone 5S Cases
       Apple also launched a new lineup of iPhone 5 cases in a variety of
       colors.
   14. Apple-event-19

Availability
       The iPhone 5S will go on sale Sept. 20 in nine countries: the
       United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and
       the UK. Like previous generations, it will come with 16, 32 or 64GB
       of storage for $199, $299 and $399, respectively -- as long as you
       sign a two-year contract with AT&T, Verizon or Sprint (T-Mobile's
       installment pricing is somewhat different).
