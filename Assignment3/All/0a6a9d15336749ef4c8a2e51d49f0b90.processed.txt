   Why Steve Ballmer's Early Retirement Is My Own Greatest Failure
   I look back at the last decade or so of my life and much of that decade
   was spent trying to figure out how to keep Steve Ballmer from failing.
   I'd developed a series of theories based on my study of IBM's only CEO
   firing and figured I had a model for how to save a CEO in Steve's
   position and assure their success. I had no idea how aggressively the
   eco system surrounding Microsoft would work against me I'd even met
   with Steve prior to his starting in the hope that would set a
   foundation that would assure his success. In the end my attempts only
   seemed to make him angrier and didn't actually move the ball. I write
   about the why of this and my regret in my ITBusenessEdge piece this
   week:
