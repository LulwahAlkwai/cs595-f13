Hello, October

   September was amazing, [11]just like I hoped it would be.  I started
   going to therapy, and lo and behold, it actually works. Astonishing.

   One of the biggest things that's helped with my anxiety is the process
   of changing my thought life. It's slow work...I've never been great at
   positive thinking. Up until now, I've considered myself more of a
   realist. It's important to me to look for truth wherever I can find it,
   even if the truth is painful.

   What I've discovered, however, is that changing your thought life has
   very little to do with embracing "positive" thoughts and getting rid of
   "negative" ones. It's more about telling yourself the whole story, and
   not just the one that supports your beliefs (especially beliefs that
   are keeping you from living the life you want).

I'M DECLARING OCTOBER "INTERNAL DIALOGUE AWARENESS MONTH"

   My purpose for Hello, Month is to make every month the best month
   ever. I've spent years creating exactly the life and business that's
   perfect for me...and I still struggle with anxiety. I'm living proof
   that your outward circumstances have little to do with the state of
   your heart and happiness.

   I'm learning that if you can change your thoughts, you can change your
   entire world without moving an inch. If you'd like to join me, spend
   some time on the site this month. October is going to be the best month
   yet.

   Happy October!

   Love, Sarah

October 1st

   Dear Me,

   I know you've tried to think more positively in the past and haven't
   succeeded in changing your thinking long-term. That's okay. It just
   means there is more to try.

   Take a look at this theory for changing your thought patterns. Today,
   just notice. Notice every time you feel nervous or guilty or sad or
   angry. Then notice what happened right before you started feeling that
   way. (And if you want to work on those thoughts, you can skip ahead to
   tomorrow. There really are no rules here.)

   Love,

   the You who knows how to fly

October 2nd

   Dear Me,

   Remember in college when you learned about logical fallacies? You got
   really good at spotting invalid arguments -- arguments that could not
   possibly be true because they didn't follow the rules of logic.

   Unproductive thoughts are a lot like that. When you have a thought that
   follows an unproductive pattern, you know you're not telling yourself
   the whole story. You need to find different reasoning to support your
   beliefs. If you can't, then the only reasonable thing is to change your
   beliefs to line up with the truth.

   Take a look at this list of Unproductive Thoughts. Today, if you notice
   yourself feeling sucky, make a list of the thoughts running through
   your head. Then take those thoughts and see if any of them follow these
   thought patterns.

   Love,

   the You who is climbing great heights

October 3rd


   Dear Me,

   Sometimes just knowing that you're having an unproductive thought
   pattern is enough to make you feel better. Other times, you need to
   look deeper.

   Every unproductive thought pattern has a productive counterpoint. Today
   as you're noticing any unproductive thoughts, see if you can match them
   up with their more productive version.

   Love,

   the You who is full of possibility

October 4th

   Dear Me,

   It's natural (and often helpful) to "read" the people around you to
   gauge how they are reacting to what's going on.  However, those hunches
   can become unproductive when you think someone is feeling or thinking
   something negative when you don't have solid proof.

   Today, practice taking people at face value, giving them the benefit of
   the doubt if you do wonder what they're thinking or feeling. And if you
   need to know for sure, ask -- don't assume. Then take them at their
   word.

   Love,

   the You who always has room for more love

October 5th

   Dear Me,

   It's hard-wired into you to be prepared for the worst. Biologically
   speaking, this is unnecessary -- you're unlikely to face any real
   danger in your day-to-day life (like being chased down by rabid grizzly
   bears, for instance). Still, you persist in imagining bad things
   happening to you.

   Today, practice imagining something good happening. What if you meet
   someone new? What if you get a great idea? What if you have the time of
   your life?

   Love,

   the You who is prepared for the best

October 6th

   Dear Me,

   When you imagine bad things happening to you, you usually underestimate
   your ability to handle it. You think if your fears were to take place,
   it would be awful. But even if your circumstances were to become
   legitimately unfortunate, they are rarely debilitating.  Even the worst
   situations bring possibility on their heels, because they force you to
   let go of things that were taking tremendous energy to hold on to.

   What are you afraid of? Today, remember that you are resilient and
   strong. It's unlikely that your fears will be realized, and even if
   they do, you can handle anything in the moment. It may even be
   possibility calling. Let go.

   Love,

   the You who can do this

October 7th

   Dear Me,

   You love to categorize things. It helps you run on auto-pilot when you
   don't have to figure something out more than once.

   The problem is, you also do this with people (including yourself). Once
   you put a label on someone (selfish, undependable, slow), you treat
   them like they ARE that trait, which actually serves to perpetuate it
   by not allowing for the possibility of change.

   Today, practice acknowledging the unique and changing nature of
   yourself and the people around you. Notice the labels you've adopted,
   and imagine what it would be like if they didn't exist.

   Love,

   the You who gets more lovely by the day

October 8th

   Dear Me,

   It's ironic that you work so hard to do a good job, and then when the
   job is finished, you downplay the part you had in it. You mentally move
   onto the next thing you want to succeed at without celebrating your
   most recent accomplishment. After a while, you doubt whether you
   contributed to that accomplishment at all.

   What was your most recent accomplishment? Today, embrace that victory
   and let yourself relish the feeling of a job well done.

   Love,

   the You who is victorious

October 9th

   Dear Me,

   It's easy to see what's wrong with any given situation, because you are
   hard-wired to avoid pain. The bad part is, it's easy to become
   ever-attuned to situations that are far from painful, but are less than
   ideal.

   Luckily, you can re-wire your brain to become more in tune with the
   good things that are happening around you. The trick is to consciously
   notice them, and be as specific as you can.

   For example, I am noticing this beautiful notebook I'm writing in,
   which is the perfect size and weight to hold my thoughts. I am noticing
   the way my felt-tip pen is full of ink as it glides across the paper. I
   am noticing my very bright blue pants that make me happy.

   What gifts are you noticing right now?

   Love,

   the You who is ardently blessed

October 10th

   Dear Me,

   When someone hurts you, it's tempting to protect yourself from future
   hurt by making a "rule" for yourself. For example, if your best friend
   uses information told in confidence against you, you may conclude that
   friends can't be trusted, and you might make a "rule" never to be that
   vulnerable with someone again.

   However, just because one friend hurt you doesn't mean that all friends
   would do the same. To make that assumption is to close yourself off
   from meaningful connections, since all close relationships require
   vulnerability.

   Today, notice any rules you've made to protect yourself, consciously or
   unconsciously. Is that rule keeping out something you want to have in
   your life? Is it worth it?

   Love,

   the You whose only rule is Love

October 11th

   Dear Me,

   Sometimes it's easier to think in black-and-white rather than
   acknowledge the complexity of your situation. "Either I do this 'the
   right way' or I don't do it at all." "Either I quit my job and go out
   on my own now, or I will never follow my dream."  In reality, there are
   many solutions to every problem -- the only limit is your creativity.

   Today, notice where you're thinking is "all-or-nothing". What other
   options could you create?

   Love,

   the You who has no limits


October 12th

   Dear Me,

   I notice you thinking about a lot of things you "should" be doing. Who
   is making up all those "shoulds"? What if you could fire that person?

   Today, notice when you feel like you "should" be doing a particular
   thing. Ask "who says?" And just see if you can't let that person have
   the day off.

   Love,

   the You who is free to be you

October 13th

   Dear Me,

   What do you blame yourself for? That's a lot of weight to carry on one
   person's shoulders.

   Rarely is any situation the cause of one single person's decisions.
   What if you shared that responsibility today? What if you put that
   weight on the shoulders of the many circumstances that contributed to
   the outcome, and then collectively heaved that weight into outer space?
   You'll have a lot more available strength to affect the outcome of
   today.

   Love,

   the You who is unfettered
