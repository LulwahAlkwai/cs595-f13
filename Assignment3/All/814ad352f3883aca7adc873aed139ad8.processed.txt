   What's This?

   [48]HP made a deal with [49]Leap Motion a couple of months ago, and
   we're now seeing the first fruits of [50]that partnership in the Envy
   17: a big laptop with Leap's motion control technology built in.

   As a PC, the Envy 17 is an outlier -- its 17.3-inch screen pushes the
   upper limit of portability, but no doubt makes it easier to embed the
   Leap controller. The motion sensor, which is precise enough to discern
   all 10 fingers on a user, is on a thin horizontal strip that sits to
   the right of the trackpad.

   See also: [51]The Problem With Windows 8

   The sensor is thinner and longer than the standalone [52]Leap sensor
   you can buy today. Leap specially designed a sensor to fit inside a
   laptop chassis, and at 0.14 inches in height, the company says it's the
   "smallest embeddable 3D motion control technology" in the world. Leap's
   app store, Airspace, is pre-installed on the machine along with drivers
   for the controller, so you can start using it out of the box.

   With or without the Leap, the Envy 17 is a powerful Windows PC. The
   screen is full HD (1,920 x 1,080), it's powered by a fourth-generation
   ("Haswell") Intel Core i7 processor, and it includes a 1TB hard disk on
   board for storage. Buyers will be able to upgrade from Intel graphics
   to Nvidia.

   When Mashable checked out the [53]Leap Motion controller, we found some
   bugs, but a fascinating attempt at creating a new experience for
   controlling a PC. As with any new platform, though, it lives and dies
   by its apps. Right now there are few that truly bring out the Leap's
   potential -- but they exist.

   The world's first Leap Motion-enabled laptop starts at $1,049.99. It
   will be available in October.

   Would you buy a laptop with motion controls? Let us know in the
   comments.
