   You must have seen the warning a thousand times: Too few young people
   study scientific or technical subjects, businesses can't find enough
   workers in those fields, and the country's competitive edge is
   threatened.

   It pretty much doesn't matter what country you're talking about--the
   United States is facing this crisis, as is [24]Japan, the [25]United
   Kingdom, [26]Australia, [27]China,[28] Brazil, [29]South Africa,
   [30]Singapore, [31]India...the list goes on. In many of these
   countries, the predicted shortfall of STEM (short for science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics) workers is supposed to number
   in the hundreds of thousands or even the millions. A 2012 report by
   President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, for
   instance, stated that over the next decade, [32]1 million additional
   STEM graduates will be needed. In the U.K., the Royal Academy of
   Engineering reported last year that the nation will have to graduate
   [33]100 000 STEM majors every year until 2020 just to stay even with
   demand. [34]Germany, meanwhile, is said to have a shortage of about
   210 000 workers in what's known there as the MINT
   disciplines--mathematics, computer science, natural sciences, and
   technology.

   The situation is so dismal that governments everywhere are now pouring
   billions of dollars each year into myriad efforts designed to boost the
   ranks of STEM workers. President Obama has called for government and
   industry to train 10 000 new U.S. engineers every year as well as
   [35]100 000 additional STEM teachers by 2020. And until those new
   recruits enter the workforce, [36]tech companies like Facebook, IBM,
   and Microsoft are lobbying to boost the number of H-1B visas--temporary
   immigration permits for skilled workers--from 65 000 per year to as
   many as 180 000. The European Union is similarly introducing the new
   [37]Blue Card visa to bring in skilled workers from outside the EU. The
   government of India has said it needs to add [38]800 new universities,
   in part to avoid a [39]shortfall of 1.6 million university-educated
   engineers by the end of the decade.

   And yet, alongside such dire projections, you'll also find reports
   suggesting just the opposite--that there are more STEM workers than
   suitable jobs. One study found, for example, that [40]wages for U.S.
   workers in computer and math fields have largely stagnated since 2000.
   Even as the Great Recession slowly recedes, STEM workers at every stage
   of the career pipeline, from freshly minted grads to mid- and
   late-career Ph.D.s, still struggle to find employment as many
   companies, including Boeing, [41]IBM, and [42]Symantec, continue to lay
   off thousands of STEM workers.
   [43]09STEMeducation graph
   A Matter of Supply vs. Demand: Every year U.S. schools grant more STEM
   degrees than there are available jobs. When you factor in H-1B visa
   holders, existing STEM degree holders, and the like, it's hard to make
   a case that there's a STEM labor shortage.

   To parse the simultaneous claims of both a shortage and a surplus of
   STEM workers, we'll need to delve into the data behind the debate, how
   it got going more than a half century ago, and the societal, economic,
   and nationalistic biases that have perpetuated it. And what that
   dissection reveals is that there is indeed a STEM crisis--just not the
   one everyone's been talking about. The real STEM crisis is one of
   literacy: the fact that today's students are not receiving a solid
   grounding in science, math, and engineering.

   In preparing this article, I went through hundreds of reports,
   articles, and white papers from the past six decades. There were plenty
   of data, but there was also an extraordinary amount of inconsistency.
   Who exactly is a STEM worker: somebody with a bachelor's degree or
   higher in a STEM discipline? Somebody whose job requires use of a STEM
   subject? What about someone who manages STEM workers? And which
   disciplines and industries fall under the STEM umbrella?

   Such definitions obviously affect the counts. For example, in the
   United States, both the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the
   Department of Commerce track the number of STEM jobs, but using
   different metrics. According to Commerce, [44]7.6 million individuals
   worked in STEM jobs in 2010, or about 5.5 percent of the U.S.
   workforce. That number includes professional and technical support
   occupations in the fields of computer science and mathematics,
   engineering, and life and physical sciences as well as management. The
   [45]NSF, by contrast, counts 12.4 million science and engineering jobs
   in the United States, including a number of areas that the Commerce
   Department excludes, such as health-care workers (4.3 million) and
   psychologists and social scientists (518 000).

The STEM Crisis Through the Decades

Predictions of an impending shortage of scientists and engineers are nothing
new.

   "Right now...there is a sufficiency of engineers, but one of our

   Such inconsistencies don't just create confusion for numbers junkies
   like me; they also make rational policy discussions difficult.
   Depending on your point of view, you can easily cherry-pick data to
   bolster your argument.

   Another surprise was the apparent mismatch between earning a STEM
   degree and having a STEM job. Of the 7.6 million STEM workers counted
   by the Commerce Department, only 3.3 million possess STEM degrees.
   Viewed another way, about 15 million U.S. residents hold at least a
   bachelor's degree in a STEM discipline, but three-fourths of
   them--11.4 million--work outside of STEM.

   The departure of STEM graduates to other fields starts early. In 2008,
   the NSF surveyed STEM graduates who'd earned bachelor's and master's
   degrees in 2006 and 2007. It found that [46]2 out of 10 were already
   working in non-STEM fields. And 10 years after receiving a STEM degree,
   [47]58 percent of STEM graduates had left the field, according to a
   2011 study from Georgetown University.

   The takeaway? At least in the United States, you don't need a STEM
   degree to get a STEM job, and if you do get a degree, you won't
   necessarily work in that field after you graduate. If there is in fact
   a STEM worker shortage, wouldn't you expect more people with STEM
   degrees to be filling those jobs? And if many STEM jobs can be filled
   by people who don't have STEM degrees, then why the big push to get
   more students to pursue STEM?

   Now consider the projections that suggest a STEM worker shortfall. One
   of the most cited in recent U.S. debates comes from the 2011 Georgetown
   University report mentioned above, by Anthony P. Carnevale, Nicole
   Smith, and Michelle Melton of the [48]Center on Education and the
   Workforce. It estimated there will be slightly more than 2.4 million
   STEM job openings in the United States between 2008 and 2018, with 1.1
   million newly created jobs and the rest to replace workers who retire
   or move to non-STEM fields; they conclude that there will be roughly
   277 000 STEM vacancies per year.

   But the Georgetown study did not fully account for the Great Recession.
   It projected a downturn in 2009 but then a steady increase in jobs
   beginning in 2010 and a return to normal by the year 2018. In fact,
   though, [49]more than 370 000 science and engineering jobs in the
   United States were lost in 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor
   Statistics.

   I don't mean to single out this study for criticism; it just
   illustrates the difficulty of accurately predicting STEM demand and
   supply even a year or two out, let alone over a prolonged period.
   Highly competitive science- and technology-driven industries are
   volatile, where radical restructurings and [50]boom-and-bust cycles
   have been the norm for decades. Many STEM jobs today are also
   [51]targets for outsourcing or [52]replacement by automation.

   The nature of STEM work has also changed dramatically in the past
   several decades. In engineering, for instance, your job is no longer
   linked to a company but to a funded project. Long-term employment with
   a single company has been replaced by a series of de facto temporary
   positions that can quickly end when a project ends or the market
   shifts. To be sure, engineers in the 1950s were sometimes laid off
   during recessions, but they expected to be hired back when the economy
   picked up. That rarely happens today. And unlike in decades past,
   [53]employers seldom offer generous education and training benefits to
   engineers to keep them current, so out-of-work engineers find they
   quickly become technologically obsolete.

   Any of these factors can affect both short-term and longer-term demand
   for STEM workers, as well as for the particular skills those workers
   will need. The agencies that track science and engineering employment
   know this to be true. Buried in Chapter 3 of a [54]2012 NSF workforce
   study, for instance, you'll find this caveat: "Projections of
   employment growth are plagued by uncertain assumptions and are
   notoriously difficult to make."

   So is there a shortfall of STEM workers or isn't there?

   The Georgetown study estimates that nearly [55]two-thirds of the STEM
   job openings in the United States, or about 180 000 jobs per year, will
   require bachelor's degrees. Now, if you apply the Commerce Department's
   definition of STEM to the [56]NSF's annual count of science and
   engineering bachelor's degrees, that means about 252 000 STEM graduates
   emerged in 2009. So even if all the STEM openings were entry-level
   positions and even if only new STEM bachelor's holders could compete
   for them, that still leaves 70 000 graduates unable to get a job in
   their chosen field.

   Of course, the pool of U.S. STEM workers is much bigger than that: It
   includes new STEM master's and Ph.D. graduates (in 2009, [57]around 80
   000 and 25 000, respectively), STEM associate degree graduates (about
   40 000), H-1B visa holders ([58]more than 50 000), other immigrants and
   visa holders with STEM degrees, technical certificate holders, and
   non-STEM degree recipients looking to find STEM-related work. And then
   there's the vast number of STEM degree holders who graduated in
   previous years or decades.

   Even in the computer and IT industry, the sector that employs the most
   STEM workers and is expected to grow the most over the next 5 to 10
   years, not everyone who wants a job can find one. A recent [59]study by
   the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a liberal-leaning think tank in
   Washington, D.C., found that more than a third of recent computer
   science graduates aren't working in their chosen major; of that group,
   almost a third say the reason is that there are no jobs available.

   Spot shortages for certain STEM specialists do crop up. For instance,
   the recent explosion in data analytics has sparked demand for [60]data
   scientists in health care and retail. But the H-1B visa and similar
   immigrant hiring programs are meant to address such shortages. The
   problem is that students who are contemplating what field to specialize
   in can't assume such shortages will still exist by the time they emerge
   from the educational pipeline.

   What's perhaps most perplexing about the claim of a STEM worker
   shortage is that many studies have directly contradicted it, including
   [61]reports from Duke University, the [62]Rochester Institute of
   Technology, the [63]Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and the [64]Rand Corp.
   A 2004 Rand study, for example, stated that there was no evidence "that
   such shortages have existed at least since 1990, nor that they are on
   the horizon."

   That report argued that the best indicator of a shortfall would be a
   widespread rise in salaries throughout the STEM community. But the
   price of labor has not risen, as you would expect it to do if STEM
   workers were scarce. In computing and IT, wages have generally been
   stagnant for the past decade, according to the EPI and other analyses.
   And over the past 30 years, according to the Georgetown report,
   engineers' and engineering technicians' wages have grown the least of
   all STEM wages and also more slowly than those in non-STEM fields;
   while STEM workers as a group have seen wages rise 33 percent and
   non-STEM workers' wages rose by 23 percent, engineering salaries grew
   by just 18 percent. The situation is even more grim for those who get a
   Ph.D. in science, math, or engineering. The Georgetown study states it
   succinctly: "At the highest levels of educational attainment, STEM
   wages are not competitive."

   Given all of the above, it is difficult to make a case that there has
   been, is, or will soon be a STEM labor shortage. "If there was really a
   STEM labor market crisis, you'd be seeing very different behaviors from
   companies," notes Ron Hira, an associate professor of public policy at
   the Rochester Institute of Technology, in New York state. "You wouldn't
   see companies cutting their retirement contributions, or hiring new
   workers and giving them worse benefits packages. Instead you would see
   signing bonuses, you'd see wage increases. You would see these
   companies really training their incumbent workers."

   "None of those things are observable," Hira says. "In fact, they're
   operating in the opposite way."

   So why the persistent anxiety that a STEM crisis exists? Michael S.
   Teitelbaum, a Wertheim Fellow at Harvard Law School and a senior
   advisor to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, has studied the phenomenon,
   and he says that in the United States the anxiety dates back to World
   War II. Ever since then it has tended to run in cycles that he calls
   "alarm, boom, and bust." He says the cycle usually starts when "someone
   or some group sounds the alarm that there is a critical crisis of
   insufficient numbers of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians" and
   as a result the country "is in jeopardy of either a national security
   risk or of falling behind economically." In the 1950s, he notes,
   Americans worried that the [65]Soviet Union was producing 95 000
   scientists and engineers a year while the United States was producing
   only about 57 000. In the 1980s, it was the perceived Japanese economic
   juggernaut that was the threat, and now it is China and India.

   You'll hear similar arguments made elsewhere. In India, the director
   general of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, Vijay
   Kumar Saraswat, recently noted that in his country, "[66]a meagre four
   persons out of every 1000 are choosing S&T or research, as compared to
   110 in Japan, 76 in Germany and Israel, 55 in USA, 46 in Korea and 8 in
   China." Leaders in South Africa and Brazil cite similar statistics to
   show how they are likewise falling behind in the STEM race.

   "The government responds either with money [for research] or, more
   recently, with visas to increase the number of STEM workers,"
   Teitelbaum says. "This continues for a number of years until the claims
   of a shortage turn out not to be true and a bust ensues." Students who
   graduate during the bust, he says, are shocked to discover that "they
   can't find jobs, or they find jobs but not stable ones."

   At the moment, we're in the alarm-heading-toward-boom part of the
   cycle. According to a recent report from the Government Accountability
   Office, the U.S. government spends more than [67]US $3 billion each
   year on 209 STEM-related initiatives overseen by 13 federal agencies.
   That's about $100 for every U.S. student beyond primary school. In
   addition, major corporations are collectively spending millions to
   support STEM educational programs. And every U.S. state, along with a
   host of public and private universities, high schools, middle schools,
   and even primary schools, has its own STEM initiatives. The result is
   that many people's fortunes are now tied to the STEM crisis, real or
   manufactured.

   Clearly, powerful forces must be at work to perpetuate the cycle. One
   is obvious: the bottom line. Companies would rather not pay STEM
   professionals high salaries with lavish benefits, offer them training
   on the job, or guarantee them decades of stable employment. So having
   an oversupply of workers, whether domestically educated or imported, is
   to their benefit. It gives employers a larger pool from which they can
   pick the "best and the brightest," and it helps keep wages in check. No
   less an authority than Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal
   Reserve, said as much when in 2007 he advocated boosting the number of
   skilled immigrants entering the United States so as [68]to "suppress"
   the wages of their U.S. counterparts, which he considered too high.

Q. If a student came to you for advice, would you encourage him or her to
pursue a career in STEM?

   IEEE Spectrum recently posed that question to a select group of IEEE
   members. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they would "strongly
   encourage" the student to take such a career path because it is
   "interesting and stimulating work" and one in which a person "can make
   a difference in the world."

   For more, view [69]the complete results from the latest IEEE
   Spectrum Forecasters Survey.

   Governments also push the STEM myth because an abundance of scientists
   and engineers is widely viewed as an [70]important engine for
   innovation and also for national defense. And the perception of a STEM
   crisis benefits higher education, says Ron Hira, because as "taxpayers
   subsidize more STEM education, that works in the interest of the
   universities" by allowing them to expand their enrollments.

   An oversupply of STEM workers may also have a beneficial effect on the
   economy, says Georgetown's Nicole Smith, one of the coauthors of the
   2011 STEM study. If STEM graduates can't find traditional STEM jobs,
   she says, "they will end up in other sectors of the economy and be
   productive."

   The problem with proclaiming a STEM shortage when one doesn't exist is
   that such claims can actually create a shortage down the road,
   Teitelbaum says. When previous STEM cycles hit their "bust" phase,
   up-and-coming students took note and steered clear of those fields, as
   happened in computer science after the dot-com bubble burst in 2001.

   Emphasizing STEM at the expense of other disciplines carries other
   risks. Without a good grounding in the arts, literature, and history,
   STEM students narrow their worldview--and their career options. [71]In
   a 2011 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Norman Augustine, former
   chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin, argued that point. "In my position
   as CEO of a firm employing over 80 000 engineers, I can testify that
   most were excellent engineers," he wrote. "But the factor that most
   distinguished those who advanced in the organization was the ability to
   think broadly and read and write clearly."

   A broader view, I and many others would argue, is that everyone needs a
   solid grounding in science, engineering, and math. In that sense, there
   is indeed a shortage--a STEM knowledge shortage. To fill that shortage,
   you don't necessarily need a college or university degree in a STEM
   discipline, but you do need to learn those subjects, and learn them
   well, from childhood until you head off to college or get a job.
   Improving everyone's STEM skills would clearly be good for the
   workforce and for people's employment prospects, for public policy
   debates, and for everyday tasks like balancing checkbooks and
   calculating risks. And, of course, when science, math, and engineering
   are taught well, they engage students' intellectual curiosity about the
   world and how it works.

   Many children born today are likely to live to be 100 and to have not
   just one distinct career but two or three by the time they retire at
   80. Rather than spending our scarce resources on ending a mythical STEM
   shortage, we should figure out how to make all children literate in the
   sciences, technology, and the arts to give them the best foundation to
   pursue a career and then transition to new ones. And instead of
   continuing our current global obsession with STEM shortages, industry
   and government should focus on creating more STEM jobs that are
   enduring and satisfying as well.

To Probe Further

   [72]Science and Engineering Careers in the United States: An Analysis
   of Markets and Employment (University of Chicago Press, 2009), edited
   by Richard B. Freeman and Daniel L. Goroff, provides a highly useful
   introduction to the forces in the early to mid-2000s that shaped
   current STEM shortage arguments in the United States.

   Chapter 13 of Benoît Godin's [73]Measurement and Statistics on Science
   and Technology: 1920 to the Present (Routledge Studies in the History
   of Science, Technology, and Medicine, 2012) shows how the claims of
   scientist and engineer shortages in the United States and United
   Kingdom after the Second World War were based on dubious statistics,
   and notes that the success rate of U.S. government predictions on the
   supply and demand for scientists and engineers has been about zero.

   The National Research Council's [74]Rising Above the Gathering Storm:
   Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future(The
   National Academies Press, 2007) and [75]Rising Above the Gathering
   Storm, Revisited: Rapidly Approaching Category 5(The National Academies
   Press, 2010)are must reads. The first report triggered the current STEM
   shortage debate in the United States, and the second one fanned the
   flames. Written by a select committee of business and academic leaders,
   the first report concluded that the United States appeared to be "on a
   losing path" in its ability to innovate and globally compete, because
   the U.S. school system was failing to prepare the nation's future STEM
   workers. The second report concluded that because the first report's
   recommendations had not been funded, the situation was now reaching
   catastrophic proportions. If these reports were the only ones you read
   on the subject, you too would believe there is a national STEM crisis.

   One of the key conclusions of Hal Salzman, Daniel Kuehn, and B. Lindsay
   Lowell's "[76]Guestworkers in the High-Skill U.S. Labor Market"
   (Briefing Paper #359, Economic Policy Institute, 24 April 2013) is that
   while there is an adequate supply of U.S. STEM workers and potential
   STEM graduates, this may not be the case in the IT sector, given that
   guest workers are willing to work "at wages that are too low to induce
   a significantly increased supply from the domestic workforce."

   In [77]"The Hidden STEM Economy" (Brookings Institution, 2013),
   Jonathan Rothwell argues that STEM workers include not just those with
   bachelor's or higher degrees, but anyone who uses "specialized
   knowledge" in any STEM discipline, such as plumbers and auto mechanics.
   Counted this way, there are 26 million STEM jobs in the United States,
   or about 20 percent of the workforce, as opposed to the 5 million to 6
   million jobs counted the traditional way. Many of Rothwell's arguments
   echoed those made in a 1964 report from the American Council on
   Education entitled "Man, Education, and Work: Post Secondary Vocational
   and Technical Education."

   One oft-cited argument for boosting the number of U.S. STEM graduates
   is that China and India are each graduating hundreds of thousands of
   engineers per year. But in their 2007 article [78]"Where the Engineers
   Are" (Issues in Science and Technology), Vivek Wadhwa of Duke
   University and his colleagues revealed that the graduation numbers from
   China and India have been exaggerated; for example, in China, they
   write, "a motor mechanic or a technician could be considered an
   engineer." The authors argued that the United States should still
   increase its investment in R&D and STEM education, as both India and
   China would no doubt work to improve the quality of their own STEM
   graduates.

   Ron Hira, a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, wrote a
   series of reports as part of the STEM Workforce Data Project. In
   [79]"U.S. Policy and the STEM Workforce System" (Commission on
   Professionals in Science and Technology, 2007), he analyzes why, given
   STEM's supposed importance to the nation's standard of living and
   national defense, there is so little objective information for making
   informed policy decisions.

   [80]"The Current Model of STEM Graduate Education and Postdocs" [PDF]
   is a presentation given in November 2007 by Michael S. Teitelbaum,
   senior advisor to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. A world-respected
   demographer, he looks at the claims of STEM shortages and shortfalls at
   the graduate level and calls them a "long, embarrassing history."

   [81]"Will the Scientific and Technology Workforce Meet the Requirements
   of the Federal Government?," a 2004 report by William Butz and
   colleagues at the Rand Corp., found no evidence, regardless of what
   measure was used, "that [STEM] shortages have existed at least since
   1990, nor that they are on the horizon."

   Does the U.S. Department of Defense face a STEM worker shortage? No,
   concludes [82]"Assuring the U.S. Department of Defense a Strong
   Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Workforce"
   (National Research Council, 2012), a report from the National
   Academies. What's more, the report finds, "DOD representatives state
   virtually unanimously that they foresee no shortage of STEM workers in
   the years ahead except in a few specialty fields." Those specialties
   include cybersecurity, as well as anthropology, linguistics, and
   sociology.

   Heather B. Gonzalez and Jeffrey J. Kuenzi's [83]" Science, Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer" [PDF]
   (Congressional Research Service, 1 August 2012) clearly and succinctly
   lays out the major issues involved in the STEM debate.

   In 2013 the Australian Industry Group, a nonprofit group representing
   some 60 000 businesses in Australia, published [84]"Lifting Our
   Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) Skills." [PDF] It
   called for "a major re-think by Australian education at all levels and
   in all sectors" to increase both the number and quality of Australian
   STEM graduates. In its tone and recommendations, it's very similar to
   the U.S. "Gathering Storm" reports.

   The U.K. equivalent to the "Gathering Storm" reports is [85]"Jobs and
   Growth: the Importance of Engineering Skills to the Economy," [PDF]
   published in 2012 by the Royal Academy of Engineering. It concluded
   that the United Kingdom needs an annual minimum of 100 000 STEM
   graduates, along with another 60 000 technically trained individuals,
   over the next decade just to maintain the status quo. Unlike in the
   United States, where engineering salaries have stagnated, the report
   found "a persistent, sizeable wage premium for people holding
   engineering degrees" in the past 20 years.

   The German equivalent to STEM is MINT--mathematics, computer science,
   natural sciences, and technology. Written in German,
   "[86]MINT-Frühjahrsreport 2013" (MINT Spring Report 2013), published by
   the Cologne Institute for Economic Research, analyzes German employment
   data for MINT workers, from academics to technicians. One useful metric
   is the comparison of job openings with unemployed workers in different
   MINT categories and occupations, although there are limits to this
   approach.
