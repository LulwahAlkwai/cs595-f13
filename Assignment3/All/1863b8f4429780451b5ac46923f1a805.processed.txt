[4]Does academic research cause economic growth?

   In most developed countries, government massively funds through
   academic grants, government laboratories, tax credits and research
   contracts: government R&D alone can often reach 1% of the GDP. In
   Canada, the government loves tax credits. In the US, the government
   spends about 60% of all its R&D funding on the military.

   Is this government funding a good thing?

   What economists tell us is that R&D funding is probably the most
   important factor determining economic growth. If you want economic
   growth, then you should be favorable to more research funding. And
   therefore, it follows that government funding for research ought to be
   a good idea.

   The problem is that it is private R&D that contributes to economic
   growth, not government R&D:
     *

     The overall rate of return to R&D is very large, perhaps 25 percent
     as a private return and a total of 65 percent for social returns.
     However, these returns apply only to privately financed R&D in
     industry. Returns to many forms of publicly financed R&D are near
     zero. ([5]Sveikauskas, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Washington, 2007)
     *

     The ubiquitous and fairly pessimistic finding which emerges from the
     literature is that privately funded R&D contributes significantly to
     output growth, whereas publicly financed R&D has little or no direct
     effect. ([6]Capron and van Pottelsberghe, 1998)
     *

     (...) regressions including separate variables for
     business-performed R&D and that performed by other institutions
     (mainly public research institutes) suggest that it is the former
     that drives the positive association between total R&D intensity and
     output growth. (...)
     ([7]The Sources of Economic Growth in OECD Countries, 2003).

   So the argument that economists have to make to justify government
   spending on R&D is that when the government pays for research, it
   entices companies to invest more. Thankfully, the correlation between
   public spending on R&D and private spending is good, except maybe for
   government-specific programs (such as the military R&D that the US is
   so fond of). As a policy, it seems that it makes sense to entice
   individuals and companies to do more research. Nevertheless, some
   economists remain cautious:

     (...) the government should be careful in stimulating higher
     research expenditures. Recent rates of return on R&D are estimated
     to have reached an all-time low spanning the last 45 years, (...)
     Firms are also not convinced any more that their R&D investments
     will yield high returns (...) ([8]Lang, 1999)

   But what about academic research? Do countries that publish more also
   see more growth? Yes they do (but wait before concluding):

     The correlation between GDP and publications is (...) high (...) for
     all countries in the sample analyzed here (77.7-99.6%) ([9]Lee et
     al., 2011)

   This correlation can mean one of two things (or a mix of both):
    1. Richer countries can afford more academic research.
    2. More academic research makes country richer.

   Which is it?

   We have some historical evidence in this respect.

   In the 17th and 18th centuries, France had the best funded
   intellectuals in the world. Meanwhile, the British government did not
   subsidize science and scholarship much. Yet it is in Great Britain that
   we saw the rise of the industrial evolution and of modern science.

   Similarly, the US saw a massive economic growth from its early days all
   the way to WWII... without any public funding for R&D. While other
   countries like France kept on subsidizing scholarship, it did not put
   them ahead economically. The US became the dominant world power in 1950
   without having invested much at all, as a government, in science and
   engineering. The US only started investing seriously in research at the
   end of the 1950s, because it feared the USSR. The USSR was investing in
   engineering through the state apparatus and the US felt that it had to
   match it. Remarkably, these massive investments were not followed by an
   increase in growth. And we know what happened to the USSR.

   Of course, today, the US is subsidizing academic research generously:
   according to some sources,[10] the US is twice as generous as Europe
   with respect to per capita government R&D. But is the US a wealthy
   country because of these subsidies, or can it afford these subsidies
   because its wealth?

   Economists can answer these questions using [11]Granger causality
   tests. Granger is the economist who showed that we could use the
   analysis of time series data to establish causality between variables.

   And the evidence indicates that, for wealthy countries, government
   funding for academic research does not cause economic growth:
     *

     For European Community member states, the US and Japan correlation
     between the GDP and number of publications of a given year proved to
     be non-significant. (...) Studying data referring to consecutive
     time periods revealed that there is no direct relationship between
     the GDP and information production of countries. ([12]Vinkler, 2008)
     *

     For [rich nations], there is no significant causal relationship
     between research production and the economy. ([13]Lee et al., 2011)

   Conclusion: There are good reasons to pursue academic research.
   However, academic research is more of a [14]gift economy than an
   economic growth policy, at least for rich countries. Richer countries
   can afford to do more academic research, but academic research is not
   what makes you rich (I should know!).

   federal research dollars (via Greg Linden). Moreover, you may want to

   anecdote-based analysis.

   Disclosure: I have worked in industry R&D, in government R&D and as an
   academic researcher. I have held a federal research grant for over 10
   years. My job would not exist without government funding.

    1. Nice argument, but there quite a few prevailing schools of thought
       on this which curiously you didn't mention. In particular, the
       essential idea that R&D funded by the government is much more blue
       sky, whilst privately funded R&D tends to be much closer to
       product.
       Thus, the cycle of turning an idea into a product most often starts
       at a University which prototypes an idea and establishes it is
       workable [many ideas get culled at this point]; then, a private
       firm takes over this idea [or is created to exploit it], at which
       point significant further R&D is required to actually get to
       product.
       You should see "Where Good Ideas Come From" by Steve Johnson, and
       "Wikinomics" by Tapscott & Williams ... their both a great read!

    2. I think you forgetting something. yes modey fuel research, but
       without government funded research only the idiot science R&D
       projects are funded.
       Nuclear power, Niagra falls water power plant, CERN Super collider,
       any form of math beyond calculus, GPS.
       The thing is a government must spend money on technology which must
       be explored without any immediate return.
       and after the foundation is layed by the government, then the idiot
       moneymaking R&D can be made.

    3. I've read articles suggesting that Germany's rise as an industrial
       power (surpassing Britain where the Industrial Revolution kicked
       off), was fuelled in part by a very liberal publishing regime that
       paid little attention to copyright laws. The result is supposed to
       have been a large volume of cheap books available to the public and
       rapid dissemination of new knowledge. Any thoughts on this?

    5. So fostering economic growth is not an argument to fund research.
       It would be interesting to hear how you would defend a necessity
       for research as a gift economy then. E.g., why should society help
       us out on doing what we love? After all, many people hold jobs they
       don't particularly appreciate while we have the luxury to follow
       our dreams (idealistically speaking). If we choose this path,
       parhaps if would be fair to pay a price for that choice?

    6. It can be hard to draw the line between private and public spending
       on R&D. For instance, a lot of private universities are funded from
       both the industry and the government. And universities does drive
       innovations and create wealth. Just remember Google and other
       recent startups.

    7. Goverment R&D and industry R&D are apples and oranges - in general,
       the "D" part brings economic benefits and is done by industry, and
       the "R" part doesn't get direct benefits but is neccessary for the
       development to flourish.
       For example, what many Silicon Valley VC's seem to be saying is
       that the startup economic powerhouse there is enabled mainly by the
       fact that cutting edge research happens nearby - and it seems quite
       likely that if this research would be eliminated (de-funded) then
       after a decade Silicon Valley would be no better than the other
       global startup hubs, which generate far less economic value.

   11. The conclusion is false. Gov funding has huge effects, but with a
       large time delay e.g. DARPA's arpanet (internet) and GPS.

       Before about 1958, government funding for science and engineering
       was tiny. It changed all of a sudden when NASA came about. This was
       not followed then, or later, by historically higher economic
       growth.
       Comment by [44]Daniel Lemire -- 27/2/2013 @ [45]10:02
   13. Daniel,
       I think what you really seem to be missing (or unintentionally
       stating) is that the amount of research funding does not correlate
       well with the economic growth produced.
       You claim the entire Industrial revolution as a result of the
       invention of the steam engine.
       One might make a similar claim of the internet economy.
       For all the R&D projects funded by both private and public
       organisations there will be many duds and a few successes.
       Conventional wisdom is that public funded R&D goes to those areas
       that private industry would not otherwise fund.
       The reason for public funding of these projects might not just be
       that the resultant growth is too far out for the private companies
       to stand. There are reasons beyond economic growth (no matter the
       timescale) that the public may choose to fund R&D.
       This article seems to attempt to make a bunch of correlatory data
       fit an argument without looking at the subject in a scientific
       light.

       Throughout the industrial revolution, the Brits spent nearly
       nothing on science while France was providing relatively generous
       funding. Later the US did the same as the Brits, the government
       invested little. The US only started investing, as a government,
       when it felt the communist threat... but the US was already the
       world's greatest power then.

   15. Actually, Britain did fund research in the 17th century.
       It did so via the Chruch of England. In fact it was a notable
       historical oddity that Isaac Newton did not take "holy orders" when
       so many of his fellows did.
       For two centuries, middle class educated men were given a job that
       paid pocket money plus residence, that required only a few hours a
       week (writing a sermon, giving mass, visting a few parishoners).
       Thes people included many famous scientists and writers (Lewis
       Carroll - author and mathematician) and the practice was widespread
       in the 17th century.

       France had as its state policy to fund scholarship and art. Britain
       did not.
       Oxford was indeed a state university (effectively). And you had to
       take holy orders to teach there (except for Newton). But this was
       not a state policy meant to help science and engineering. And what
       Britain spent was tiny compared to France.
       (A greater debate is how much of a role Oxford played in the
       industrial revolution. I would argue: not much. But it is another
       debate.)
       Comment by [51]Daniel Lemire -- 27/2/2013 @ [52]12:02
   17. It is irrelevant as to whether it was state policy. What is
       relevant is whether research grants existed (whether intentional or
       not).
       In the UK, It was not just Oxford. Parishes all over the UK were
       essentially hotbeds of undirected research.
       I might argue that it is not the amount of money - but rather the
       devil is in the details. The CofE apparently had an interesting
       attitude to science - I quote from Wikipedia under the entry for
       Robert Hooke discussing Dr Busby (reverend):
       Work by people as disparate as Darwin (Theology, Cambridge) and
       Stephen Hale (vicar) were all in part subsidized by the CofE.

       I would agree with that.
       The hotbed of innovation during the industrial revolution was
       Scotland. Scots were not wealthy. They did not have good support
       for scholarship or science (they did not have Oxford). But they did
       have a good culture of innovation.

   20. I am lucky in that I have a very poor grasp of history - so I do
       fresh research any time someone posits some extrapolation such as
       yours and I feel interested enough to do so.
       There is no doubt that scots were inventive and entrepreneurial in
       the industrial revolution, and so were many northerners
       (Stephenson) and welshmen (Trevithick). This however was much later
       than the period you mentioned (17 century).
       I notice that your comment tool stripped my quote above - I will
       repost it here. BTW - I am that interesting breed, the English
       Roman Catholic, so I have no axe to grind when promoting the CofE
       as a force in the development of science.
       `Busby, an ardent and outspoken Royalist (he had the school observe
       a fast-day on the anniversary of the King's beheading), was by all
       accounts trying to preserve the nascent spirit of scientific
       inquiry that had begun to flourish in Carolean England but which
       was at odds with the literal Biblical teachings of the
       Protectorate. To Busby and his select students the Anglican Church
       was a framework to support the spirit of inquiry into God's work,
       those who were able were destined by God to explore and study His
       creation, and the priesthood functioned as teachers to explain it
       to those who were less able. This was exemplified in the person of
       George Hooper, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, whom Busby described
       as "the best scholar, the finest gentleman and will make the
       completest bishop that ever was educated at Westminster School".'.

     academic research
       Not so. Most innovative new ideas are still coming from
       Universities (see "Where Good Ideas Come From", by Steve Johnson).
       However, that said, most industrial "innovations" are not really
       innovations. They are very small tweaks on existing ideas. Then
       when you trace back, you find the starting point is usually a
       University or similar (perhaps e.g. an open source development).
       Industry is actually really bad at innovation for the most part.

       Johnson states on page 234 of his book:

     Universities have a reputation for ivory-tower isolation from the
     real world, but it is an undeniable fact that most of the
     paradigmatic ideas in science and technology that arose during the
     past century have roots in academic research. This is obviously true
     for the "pure" sciences like theoretical physics, but it is also
     true for lines of research that on their surface seem to have more
     straight forwardly commercial applications, (...)
       The subject is discussed in the reference I gave you: Sex, Science
       And Profits by Terence Kealey:

     (...) though Mansfield found that around 10 per cent of industrial
     innovations emerged out of academic research, he also found that
     those innovation tended to be economically marginal, accounting for
     only 3 per cent of sales and 1 per cent of the savings or profits

       since you are the one making the assertions, the burden of proof
       lies with you
       Let me propose another approach:
       "People proposing to spend money should have the burden of the
       proof."
       This seems more reasonable.
       Now, there are tremendous benefits to funding academic research. I
       am an academic researcher and I think that I do very useful work.
       But I don't justify the money that the Canadian tax-payers spend on
       me by claiming that I am going to improve economic growth. I am
       more likely to improve the economy by going to work for Google or
       something similar.
       The work I do (on this blog and elsewhere) does not aim to make us
       richer, I would have to be pretentious to think so. I'm probably
       not going to invent the next Facebook. And whoever invents the next
       Facebook won't build on my research papers.
       Not everything of value can be measured by a growing GDP.
       Comment by [66]Daniel Lemire -- 27/2/2013 @ [67]18:01
   25. I suspect that the most likely source of research into whether
       public research positively impacts GDP would be done as public
       research.
       Here we know that RIM (now Blackberry) came out of research done at
       Waterloo, as did the company I work for (Sensors and Software).
       Certainly the basic building blocks of what I and many others do
       for a living came out of public research.
       Big companies with very succesful research divisions (IBM for
       example) continue to invest heavily in university research due to
       their perception of good returns.
       In short - I am not so sure there is any pretense - and I think the
       work has been done to prove otherwise. Your job would be to prove
       government (and IBM, Microsoft and others) wrong.

       Your job would be to prove government (and IBM, Microsoft and
       others) wrong.
       Meanwhile, here is what Milton Friedman (Nobel prize in economics)
       says about where the burden of proof should lie:

     The question remains: what ethical justification is there for
     imposing taxes on people to finance scientific research for which
     they would not voluntarily contribute? ...
     Given the undisputed success of private financing in the past, the
     burden of proof that the benefits of government financing exceed the
     costs surely rests on those who support such financing.
       Comment by [72]Daniel Lemire -- 27/2/2013 @ [73]18:24
   28. Undisputed success? I don't really care if who the author is if
       they support their argument with bald assertions.
       Epsecially as we are living in an era of the fallout from
       "undisputed failure of private financing".
       If you are arguing that government has failed to make its case
       convincingly - that is really a matter for the electorate - and the
       answer has been given repeatedly. You are just more sceptical on
       this issue than most.

   29. Daniel, I do not know about Canada, but in US public research is
       just a small fraction of GDP, most of which is apparently the NIH
       budget.
       The NSF budget is just 10 billion. These are direct grants. The GDP
       and the budget are both in trillions.
       A good question should be: if money put in a military research is
       worth it or not.

   30. Additionally, there have been over 40 nobel prize winning
       economists, and they all have opinions (albeit well researched
       opinions) which actually differ from one another.
       I would add that much of Milton Friedmans' own research was on the
       public dollar.
       Comment by [78]Dominic Amann -- 27/2/2013 @ [79]18:48
   31. @Itman
       Yes, state science funding is small (in all countries), but most of
       the public funding for research in the US goes toward defence, not
       the NIH. Arguably, the overall funding is too small. (That's what I
       believe.)
       Anyhow, really, when you talk about government R&D in the US, it is
       not about health... it is mostly about building better war
       machines.
       But my argument is not that the state shouldn't fund science. My
       argument is rather that it shouldn't fund science on the basis that
       it causes economic growth. It is important to know why we do
       things, even when they are cheap.
       Let me give you an example. Would sending men to Mars grow the GDP
       and produce industrial innovations? It is tempting to claim so. But
       the benefits of sending men to the Moon, compared to the costs, are
       not at all obvious in retrospect.
       Still. I think we should be sending men on Mars even if it does not
       contribute to the GDP.
       Not everything is about making more money.

   32. > Yes, state science funding is small (in all countries), but most
       of the public funding for research in the US goes toward defence,
       not the NIH. Arguably, the overall funding is too small. (That's
       what I believe.)
       Sure, that's my point. Another point is that the overall funding is
       small and we cannot afford not to fund. We do not know exactly if
       it helps or not (many believe that it does). However, expenses are
       small. If it does help and we do not fund, potential losses may be
       huge.
       Besides, aside from GDP, it is hard to put monetary value on the
       overall progress. We now use all Internet. It may not boost the
       GDP, but it (sometimes) makes our life better. Same thing for other
       innovations.

       You must not compared today's world with a world without Internet
       and ask how the GDP compares.
       What you must do is go back to 1950 and imagine that the US had
       stayed the course and not copied the USSR. What would have
       happened?
       Some claim that without government, we would not have had our
       current technology. We would not have had the iPad or a worldwide
       network. We would be stuck in the 1950s, run by greedy
       corporations.
       The claim can be reformulated as such: in 1950, the US had the
       wrong science policy whereas the USSR had the right science policy.
       What do we think?
       I think people can't imagine a world without a strong government
       science policy. They imagine that science wouldn't get done.
       But that's more or less like a soviet saying that without the
       government, he would not get toilet paper.

   34. Thanks for this post, its an interesting topic. A thought: given
       that most academic research is internationally disseminated via
       journal publications, what is the basis for the expected
       relationship between economic output and R&D funding? Is it that
       academic researchers who make innovations are expected to "go
       private", or collaborate with private companies in their country of
       residence?

   35. Don't forget that what you just described it's pretty much one
       well-known country for the last 20 years, i.e., no science, greedy
       corporations, etc. Some argue that US and Britain were a success,
       but France was a failure. In fact, a lot of people would disagree.
       Who knows what will happen to US and Britain soon, in the light of
       growing inequality and poor access to education.

   36. @Kieran
       That's a very interesting question.
       In theory, a country or a company could invest very little in
       engineering and science and simply copy the leaders. In practice
       this does not really work. Copying others is hard work (despite
       what people think). In fact, just understanding what others have
       done, even if you have full access to it, is very hard.

   37. I'm sorry but this is mis-informed andnot properly researched. Just
       two points:
       1. there would be no laser, and therefore no CDs, DVDs etc without
       gov't funded basic physics research that made these inventions
       possible
       2. the US in the 1940s and 50s reaped the benefits of massive
       migration of scientists from war-torn Europe, without itself
       investing much in research,
       How can such basic facts be ignored by someone who wrote this?
       Comment by Stan Matwin -- 27/2/2013 @ [91]23:59
   38. @Stan Matwin
       We owe the first working laser to the Hughes Aircraft Company and
       the science itself, at least in the USA, was built decades before
       the US adopted a science policy, mostly in private institutions
       (e.g., Stanford). The NSF started out in 1950 and it was tiny
       during its first decade (handing out dozens of grants a year). It
       is true that much of the underlying ideas were developed by Jewish
       scientists from Germany starting with Einstein, but it is unclear
       how much these Jews "owe" to the German state. I would rather give
       credit to the great Jewish culture than to the German state. I
       mean, I am quite open to a debate as to what made the German Jews
       so smart, but I really object to the notion that the German science
       policy was key to it. After all, these Jewish immigrants were also
       quite adept at other things, like movie making.

       Who knows what will happen to US and Britain soon, in the light of
       growing inequality and poor access to education.
       The US government has not been spending less on education. In fact,
       per capita and in constant dollars, the US government has never
       been spending as much as it does now on education.
       (As you know, there are alternatives such as MOOCs which can offer
       a decent education very cheaply, so there is hope.)
       Inequality might be an issue, but, again, the government's share of
       the GDP is high right now, so if there is rising inequality, it
       can't be blamed on low government spending.
       (Inequality is probably higher in one of the last communist power,
       China. Poor people in the US are nothing like poor people elsewhere
       in the world.)
       Overall, it is true that the US could collapse while France could
       win out. But it does not look that way. France is in much bigger
       trouble than the US. You might have "free" university education in
       France, but what good does it do when you hit a 2-digit
       unemployment rate when you graduate?
       There are a few things that France get right. For example, it has
       decent food. But there is hope in the US food-wise too!
       Comment by [94]Daniel Lemire -- 28/2/2013 @ [95]0:30
   40. It is just 10%. It used to be 10% in US (in 2009), while in France
       at the same point it was 8%. See, also
       [96]http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/03/us_unemployment_
       higher_than_in_france Overall, employment rates in US are only
       marginally better.
       Regarding the spending. It's probably schools, not colleges.
       Spending on them increased twice in the last 50 years, but it did
       not help much to make them better. So, it may very well be the fact
       that US is getting a more expensive education, not a better one.
       And it should spend more on education, because students have to
       study fancier things (to be a bioinformatician or a programmer). In
       general, US is quite good (as compared to many other countries).
       Poor people don't die from hunger. But it may not be enough to
       compete with China and India. Very few people were able (like you)
       to do well after graduating from a mediocre school. For many
       others, a good school was a key. Even more important than a
       college.

       expensive education, not a better one.
       Yes. That seems entirely likely.
       Meanwhile, France's unemployment rate is stuck in the double digits
       (10.3% now). The US unemployment rate is still high at 7.8%. That's
       a 30% difference ((10.3-7.8)/7.8) so it is quite significant.
       Of course, the Canadian unemployment rate is at 7%. And the
       Australians are doing much better at 5.4%.
       Of course, you might want to compare things like median income.
       However, it is fairly easy to figure out that the median income in
       France is significantly lower than the median income in the US.
       Americans are richer than the French. It is simply a statistical
       fact. It has been so for a long time.
       I think that the Americans could be much richer if they stopped
       wasting money and time on wars. It is a real disease, this idea
       that you need to have 10x as many guns than anyone else.
       Comment by [99]Daniel Lemire -- 28/2/2013 @ [100]11:36
   42. Daniel, you cannot compare unemployment at a single time point. As
       I mentioned, several years ago, the situation was the reverse. US
       had 10, but France had 8.
       Income is not directly compatible either. One may earn more, but
       has to spend more on education and medicine. Overall, the
       difference between France and US is, indeed, rather small.
       So, in one country rose with government grants, another country --
       without. Both are doing quite well. So, these examples tell us
       nothing. And they may be less useful as future references.

       The US outspends France and Europe in R&D, including government
       R&D. So you should be arguing that the US is richer if you want to
       make the point you are making. ;-)

       France sells wine. The US has Google, Microsoft, Monsanto, Walmart,
       Amazon and so on.

       Over the last ten years, the unemployment rate in France was above
       8% most of the time whereas the US unemployment rate was rarely
       above 8%.
