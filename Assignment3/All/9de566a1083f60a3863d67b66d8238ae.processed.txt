Swim in Your Lane: How the "Public Understanding of Science" Community Fails
and Betrays the Climate

   [27]August 15, 2013
   Michael Tobis

[28]Michael Tobis

   Michael Tobis, editor-in-chief of Planet3.0 and site cofounder, has
   always been interested in the interface between science and public
   policy. He holds a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin - Madison
   in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences where he developed a 3-D ocean
   model on a custom computing platform. He has been involved in
   sustainability conversations on the internet since 1992, has been a web
   software developer since 2000, and has been posting sustainability
   articles on the web since 2007.

   WTF?

   David Roberts, whom I usually think very highly of, who has
   [29]publicly blurted the following:

     So scientists can be as studiously neutral as they want. It will
     make no substantial difference. The battle is over cultural
     identity; it will be long, and messy, and the outcome is unlikely to
     have much to do with how scientists behave.

   David is one of the best thinkers and writers on the environment,
   period, so where does this nonsense come from? To be fair, while a
   first draft of this article was pending, David penned a [30]much longer
   and rather more intelligible version of it. But as I suspected (see my
   comment on the first link) he is inspired by the completely baffling
   recent [31]Dan Kahan piece which uses John Stossel as an example of
   something that "the other side" also "does".

   Shades of false balance! Stossel has long since revealed himself as
   [32]utterly incompetent to report on climate. Kahan's casting of him as
   "just like" the other "side" is based on what, exactly? Basically that
   both sides do not pay enough attention to Dan Kahan. While I can see
   why this would bother Dr. Prof. Kahan, I don't see that he has made a
   case that the rest of us should worry about it.

   What is behind this nonsense, and why does it appeal to a generally
   sensible and perceptive person like David?

   TO THE HAMMER ENTHUSIAST EVERYTHING IS A NAIL

   It turns out that there is a social science community staking out
   expertise on "Public Understanding of Science". As with any social
   science, they have no fundamental principles on which to base their
   reasoning, in the sense that physical scientists can rely on mass
   conservation, momentum conservation and the like. The usual coherence
   checks of the physical sciences do not apply, and problem complexity is
   intrinsically enormous. One has to be very careful in the soft sciences
   to ensure that one's abstractions and generalizations have utility, to
   define them with precision and without ambiguity, and to determine when
   and where they apply and where and when they don't. This being much
   more difficult in the soft sciences, failures are relatively common,
   and in considering a given study the first thing to be sure of is
   whether the postulated phenomenology is the only way to explain the
   evidence.

   A tendency, given a hammer, to call everything a nail is widespread in
   these disciplines. (The overvaluation of Integrated Assessment Models
   in evaluation of economic matters which we discussed recently is not a
   unique event in social sciences.)

   So what is the hammer in question? The hammer that Kahan is wielding is
   to accuse domain scientists of being victims of the "deficit model
   fallacy", and to claim that he is here to rescue us from our confusion.

   My claim is that the confusion to which he refers has long since been
   dispelled, and that in fact it is he who is confused, confused about
   what climate scientists want from a discipline of public understanding
   of science, and insisting on delivering us the wrong product. And in
   this he is not alone.

   To get a grip on this we have to invent a weird discipline: the
   sociology of the sociology of science. Let us look at the history of
   the "public understanding" community so we can better understand their
   hammer. Then we can decide whether we constitute a suitable nail.

   COPUS, THE POSTER CHILD FOR THE DEFICIT MODEL

   It's important to understand that the story of the "Public
   Understanding of Science" actually goes back to instances of explicit
   advocacy for specific technologies or research domains.

   The science community in the UK was granted government funds to
   encourage the public to continue funding science. The fact that such an
   expenditure of public funds is almost unimaginable nowadays in any
   English-speaking country notwithstanding, in 1986 a commission was
   formed called the Committee on Public Understanding of Science (COPUS).
   Its remit was:
     * to review the nature and extent of public understanding of science
       and technology in the UK
     * to review the mechanisms for effecting the public understanding...
     * to consider the constraints on the process of communication
     * to make recommendations

   This was all somewhat euphemistic - to increase the robustness of
   public financial support for science writ large was the intent.

   Now it strikes me that the natural mistake is to convene some
   scientists with a good reputation as teachers to address these
   questions. Of course, you will get some ideas based in experience on
   how to engage university students in a classroom or seminar. But
   students in a classroom are a captive audience and have very different
   motivations and interests than the general public. Further, the case at
   hand, science advocacy in this sense is not instruction but sales
   disguised as instruction. Accordingly, the professorial quasi-didactic
   promotional efforts will fall flat.

   From all appearances, at least from what I can glean from my source
   (the book [33]Successful Science Communication, Bennett & Jennings
   eds., Cambridge Press 2011, and especially the introductory essay
   "Public engagement in an evolving science policy landscape", by Richard
   A. L. Jones of the University of Sheffield) this is exactly what
   happened.

   This is unsurprising. What is surprising is the emergence of a
   sustained academic community from the detritus of this minor fiasco.

   ASIDE: MY PAST HISTORY WITH THE "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES"
   COMMUNITY

   I have to admit that I have a long-standing grudge against the
   sociology of science (Science and Technology Studies) community, which
   digging into [34]my old usenet files may turn up. In particular there
   is a fellow called [35]Bruno Latour who was doing all sorts of mischief
   in the 1980s and 1990s, though insofar as climate is concerned he has
   [36]sheepishly and memorably recanted. For present purposes, allow me
   to say that I fully agree with Latour's mea culpa - he has done us all
   a remarkable disservice by looking at only one side of the coin.

   But since I took issue with him long ago, I am somewhat innoculated
   against claims to authority from "science studies" fields. Perhaps I'm
   again the one to be discussing yet another emperor's garb. You may
   choose to discount what I say on the basis that I'm a habitual
   iconoclast, or you can on the other hand tentatively consider it
   seriously on the grounds that I was right about Latour before Latour
   was.

   EMERGENCE OF "PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE" AS A SUBDISCIPLINE OF
   SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENCE

   So, in the community of those who like to cite Latour as a serious
   thinker, the failure of COPUS presented them with a golden opportunity.
   It was, after all, an attempt by scientists to claim authority, which
   failed. How delightful!

   A passel of more or less politically correct position papers emerged
   from this minor fiasco. Prominent among the critics was Bryan Wynne,
   who in 1990 presented a paper which I believe addressed the COPUS
   effort, with the eminently relativist title "Knowledges in Context"
   (presented at Policies and Publics for Science and Technology". Wynne
   also wrote a chapter called "Public Understanding of Science" in
   Jasanoff et al., eds., The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies
   (1995) and is credited with coining the phrase "deficit model" in
   "Creating public alienation: expert cultures of risk and ethics on
   GMOs" Science as Culture, 10 445-481.

   In short, it seems that the origin of the phrase "deficit model" was an
   attack on the authority of "science", specifically, on the authority of
   science to justify the practice of science.

   Numerous studies followed. An incident of particular salience
   involved biotech and genetically modified organisms. The scientific
   community tends to be dismissive of public concerns on this matter,
   something which tends to backfire.

     When genetically modified crops became a controversial issue in
     1999, the UK government, scientific institutions, the public, the
     media and industry were once more drawn into a public debate about
     scientific uncertainty, risks, and how best to communicate science
     to the public. ... Monsanto, for example, still assumed that by
     providing the facts of genetic modification they could lead the
     public to accept it, not appreciating that much of the public
     dissent was over the ethical, social and political implications of
     the technology, on top of uncertainties about its safety to humans
     and the environment. ...

     The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology ...
     put forward many recommendations as to how this relationship could
     be improved, not least by advocating a shift away from `simply
     giving information' to `engaging the broader public about what
     science could and should be doing'. ...

     The House of Lords Report is ... another watershed moment in the
     history of the public understanding of science in the UK.

   There is a real point here, one which [37]Steve Easterbrook has made in
   discussions of GMOs: while there certainly are irrational reasons for
   people to oppose GMOs, not all the reasons are irrational. (Do we
   really want to allow corporate dominance of our food supply by granting
   intellectual property rights on our principal crops? Not a question
   that scientific defense of GMOs tends to take up.) These concerns,
   however, are orthogonal to the science.

   Essentially, then, the model that the "Public Understanding of Science"
   community is based on is that the "scientific community" (in practice
   this is generally an applied science with a technological agenda) wants
   public permission and approval to launch a major new technology, at
   least as a second best option to sneaking it into use.

   There is a great deal to be said for resistance to this sort of
   maneuver.

   One trouble is that the risk model is backwards here - the
   precautionary principle acts the other way round with regard to
   climate, but the Public Understanding of Science community does not
   seem willing to redesign its hammer. But it's worse than that.

   THE WRONG QUESTION

   The reason that the usual methods of "Public Understanding of Science",
   which apparently have achieved some success, do not apply to the domain
   of climate policy is fundamentally that they ask the wrong question.

   I started grappling with this [38]back in 2009, and here's some of what
   I wrote on first being immersed in it recent incarnation:

     Nisbet was also all about "global warming, yes or no", so much that
     he seemed to think "communicating science" was all about
     communicating "global warming, yes". He yammered about Al Gore
     incessantly. He mentioned the CRU business within seconds, and had
     called it "climategate". He kept referring to AGU as "environmental
     scientists"!

     This is the guy who wants to tell us about "framing"?

     The worst of it was all the spin he was advocating had nothing
     whatsoever to do with science. We should talk about energy. About
     security. We should take a tip from congress who renamed "Cap and
     Trade" to "America's Clean Energy and Security". We should talk
     about the birds and the fishes. Well fine. What you need a
     geophysicist for in that case escapes me entirely.

     It emerged that the panelists were confident that the public does
     not care about science, and that you should feed them symbols
     instead because they will ignore rational argument. To those who
     object that this is exactly what Al Gore did in his movie, they
     amend their position to state that you should feed them symbols and
     not be Mr Gore, but that otherwise what Gore does is perfect.

     People in the audience had trouble absorbing all of this. The advice
     to scientists, then, is to dress up like scientists and deliver PR
     just like the PR office tells them to.

     ...

     This isn't what I read from serious skeptics, who are livid about
     getting symbolism when they ask substantive questions. The small
     group of relevant scientists are telling the truth when they say "we
     really don't have time to discuss everything in detail, even with
     people who aren't adamant about distrusting us; we have work to do".
     The vicious circle of hostility and suspicion feeds on the opacity
     of science, not the excess of "information".

     The social scientists, big on frames, totally shared the frame of
     the denialists that climate science is about "global warming", and
     presumed that AGU is about climate science. Of course, if that were
     true, we wouldn't be very busy at all. We'd have answered the
     question "global warming, yes or no" in the affirmative already. So
     all we need to do now is to just sell our idea like soap. After all
     the other guys are doing that. If we don't come up with better
     branding and clever promotional programs, is it any wonder we're
     losing market share?

     Well, if this is framing, you can keep it, thanks.

   UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE BAD ADVICE IS COMING FROM

   I have recently developed a better understanding of where this nonsense
   is coming from, after a few weeks of [39]reading up on its history, and
   after a day of being exposed to no small amount of it at the
   [40]Science Online Climate meeting in Washington DC today.

   In particular, Nisbet at the 2009 AGU talk was big on Ed Maibach's "six
   Americas" concept. At the SciOnline plenary, Maibach himself, along
   with two other charming and engaging panelists, discussed at great
   length the political question of getting Americans to "accept climate
   science".

   The presumption underlying these presentations, though I liked all of
   them better than Nisbet's, was that people "accept climate science" if
   they profess themselves "concerned".

   This is, unfortunately, complete and utter bilge-water.

   Most people who allow that they are concerned are very unclear about
   exactly what it is they are concerned about, how much they should do
   about it, and what the world and the various nations need to do about
   it to avoid what amount of risk.

   We are incapable of having a reasonable public discourse on climate
   policy because the 99% of the public cannot put together two coherent
   true sentences about the state of climate knowledge. In particular,
   they do not understand

     1) that all net carbon emissions must cease

     but that 2) they do not need to stop for decades

     but-but that 3) we need to start working on it now.

   They do not understand that the evidence for these claims is
   overwhelming, precisely because for the most part they have not heard
   the claims and the evidence for them.

   They repeat a tired childish argument with every severe event ("because
   of global warming"/"not because of global warming"). Some endure minor
   inconveniences in services of "the environment" while others do not.

   There is absolutely no seriousness to the discussion because after
   twenty years of trying to communicate science in the presence of
   disinformation, we have not succeeded in conveying even a few hundred
   words of confident knowledge to more than a minuscule fraction of the
   population.

   In short, there is an information deficit.

   WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE INFORMATION DEFICIT

   Just as economists, without much success to show for themselves,
   nevertheless claim sovereignty over the final decisions we make as a
   society on how to manage carbon, so do the "public understanding of
   science" people claim sovereignty over the question of, well, "public
   understanding of science".

   And climate scientists, used to the very deep hard-won knowledge they
   have, long forced (by the sheer asymmetry of thenumber of people on
   each side of the conversation) to rely somewhat on authority, are
   inclined to trust people who claim authority.

   I am here to warn the community against this trust. The "public
   understanding of science" community does not on the whole understand
   the science all that well, and even in the exceptional cases they do
   not care about it very much.

   We see the failure of this trust in the nature of the conversation we
   are forever having with them.

     Climate folk: How can we get a critical mass of people to understand
     a dozen absolutely crucial points about the future of the planet?

     PUS folk: You must not do that because it is bad. Besides, you
     already have 65% acceptance, so relax.

     Climate folk: We may have 65% sympathy but we probably do not have
     1% sufficient understanding, and even our key sympathizers make us
     cringe on a daily basis!

     PUS: Deficit model! Deficit model! You are not listening to the
     experts, which is us!

   The hammer that the PUS community is wielding is to accuse domain
   scientists of being victims of the "deficit model fallacy", and to
   claim that they are here to rescue us from our confusion. Their results
   show that when we explain things to people on subjects which are
   politically polarized, they can confidently predict that the number of
   "concerned" will not measurably change in a broad population measure.

   They express this with such vehemence because they think we have failed
   to understand it. I have never heard any scientist address this subject
   who fails to understand this fact. I understand it.

   I just don't care. I can't accept this measure as indicating that
   somehow scientists would be better off not explaining science, and
   leaving the explanations to people who obviously misunderstand the
   material. Obviously that would be a horrible dereliction of duty.

   What I do care about is that whenever a moderately scientifically
   sophisticated person decides to roll up their sleeves and try to learn
   about the subject, they are presented with a choice between slick and
   polished science reporting which tells the truth at a golly-gosh
   gee-whiz level, the impenetrable primary literature, and  a vigorous
   amateur community that totally distrusts the science. The professional
   "public understanding of science" community advises us to ignore the
   segment of the public that actually wants to understand science!

   When we shrug in indifference to this utterly silly advice, they say we
   are being just as ignorant of their "social science" as we complain
   that others are of our hard science. But if scientists find their
   advice hard to conceive, it is based in the fact that our advisors are
   at best correctly answering the wrong question.

   We are not asking for permission to do science, which is the case that
   they have studied and had a helpful influence upon!

   We are asking for science to inform policy!

   That isn't the case they have any success in that I know of, and they
   seem unwilling to face this as a new topic.

   They are selling "public acceptance of science" NOT "public
   understanding of science". Acceptance, unfortunately, is not sufficient
   to the circumstance.

   A CONTRADICTION - THE ABSURDITY OF THE ANSWER

   One way to look at the absurdity of the answer is this: their work is
   self-defeating. If they have anything to say, they should not say it,
   because to try to convince somebody of something is impossible, and
   they have polling data to prove it.

   THE APPEAL TO THE PRESS

   Kahan makes four standard Public Understanding of Science points in a
   bulletted list in his essay ([41]relink) and I think all four of them
   are dubious. I'm willing to discuss any of them in the comments, but
   for present purposes I would like to focus on one of them:

     Blaming the media is also pretty weak. The claim that "unbalanced"
     media coverage causes public controversy on climate change science
     is incompatible with cross-cultural evidence, which shows that US
     coverage is no different from coverage in other nations in which the
     public isn't polarized ([42]e.g., Sweden). Indeed, the "media
     misinformation" claim has causation upside down, as  Kevin
     Arceneaux's [43]recent post helps to show. The media covers
     competing claims about the evidence because [44]climate change is
     entangled in culturally antagonistic meanings, which in
     turn [45]create persistent public demand for information on the
     nature of the conflict and for evidence that the readers who hold
     the relevant cultural identities can use to satisfy their interest
     in persisting in beliefs consistent with their identities.

   Did you get that? The fact that almost nobody far outside the tiny
   community of actual climate scientists has any idea of what is going on
   cannot be the press's fault because people are self polarizing! Because
   there are only two possible positions, right? "Global warming yes" and
   "global warming no". The press does not judge, it reports. It certainly
   has no effect.

   (I even heard one speaker today speak of "global warming supporters".
   Aargh! My ears hurt!)

   So the fact that almost nobody has the remotest awareness of the dozen
   or so salient facts we need to work out a reasonably soft landing from
   our stupidly self-inflicted and technically solvable predicament cannot
   possibly be due to the fact that they have never heard a word of it.

   Can you see why the press loves this Kahan guy? If you can't,
   [46]revisit Jay Rosen please.

   The fact that the press has had no effect on this situation is not a
   defense of the press! It is an indictment of the press! It is the job
   of the press to convey relevant information!

   sheesh...

   (By the way if you see what Arcenaux's article has to do with Kahan's
   point, you're better at reading this, ahem, stuff, than I am.)

   I guess David Roberts is close enough to this culture to buy into it.
   I'm a bit shocked. Usually he has his head screwed on right.
   pool
   ON SWIMMING IN YOUR OWN LANE

   Aside from relying on polls that test sympathy rather than
   understanding, the clear message of the Public Understanding of Science
   community to the climate community is to stick to our knitting.
   Climatologists are to do the science and produce the reports, and leave
   it to the PUS folk to "convince" the public. Of what the public is to
   be convinced, one remains unsure. For or all their talk (and, don't get
   me wrong, their good and decent intentions) it is entirely unclear what
   they themselves understand.

   Because of their intellectual history, public understanding of science
   is of no interest to them: they are interested in cases of selling
   acceptance, not of promoting understanding. Since we lack sufficient
   understanding to have an honest public discourse, they are part of the
   reason we cannot have a sensible discussion.

   Maibach was explicit about their claim to sovereignty in the
   conversation. "Just swim in your lane" he said. Someone (my apologies,
   I can't recall who) pointed out to me that this was a clearly
   turf-defensive move. "If climate scientists move into any other lanes,
   theirs would be the first one."

   THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR

   The Public "Understanding" of Science community cut its teeth on
   scientific communities acting in their own self-interest. Climate
   scientists are not acting in their own self-interest at all when they
   try to communicate with the public.

   When people ask me what "side" I'm on, I like to say I'm pro-Earthling.

   The IPCC is fundamentally a pro-Earthling organization, depending on
   the generosity of the participating institutions and individuals to
   produce a product of immense importance and value. Climate Science
   Online, similarly, is a meeting of people who want to help the world
   get through the impending bottleneck years intact. Thus it is
   disturbing to hear not only bad advice but turf-sheltering in this
   context.

   Besides, if we wanted to be narrowly focussed we wouldn't have become
   interested in climate in the first place. We have no particular lane to
   swim in!

   Yes, of course given the vicious attacks, especially on Ben Santer and
   Mike Mann, it is necessary to stand up for them as human beings. But it
   is not the scientific community that we are defending or promoting
   here. It's the planet. We aren't looking for a green light for some
   expensive research proposal. We're looking for buy-in to an immensely
   important and unprecedented (but not overwhelmingly conceptually
   complex, thank goodness) worldwide conversation.

   Nobody much is helping us, and the people who are asking us to defer to
   them on the matter are answering the wrong question.

   They are friendly and well-intentioned but they are no allies. What
   they do comes under "the opposite of helping".

       Interesting background I was mostly unaware of, although events of
       the recent past provide more than enough material to come to the
       same conclusions. Latour's realization that he was being hoist on
       his own petard was a rare moment in academic history. (BTW, here's
       his complete [55]article should anyone want to see it.)
       I'll have more to say, but for now will just make the obvious point
       that it's not majority acceptance of the implications of the
       science we need, but rather a critical mass for sufficient action,
       the former just being a sign post on the way to the latter and
       rather distant from it to boot.

       Erratum: Professor Kahan, not Dr. His education is, in the
       inimitable phrase of Richard Tol, as a legal scientist.

       There is a long history of demanding to control the interface
       between science and the public and not just oozing out from the PUS
       types (who could resist, not Eli to be sure), but also the
       economists (Nordhaus, Tol, etc.), political science types (well you
       know who) and others.
       The serious place to look for help is the marketing community, in
       short the Mad Men. They may be scum, but they know how to sell.
       Gore was effective because an Inconvenient Truth was constructed as
       a political marketing effort based on scientific knowledge, but
       designed to communicate in ways that were known to work. Climate
       Reality is a similar marketing effort, and thus, perhaps the best
       chance of bridging the gap.

            I think the first place to look for help is to people with
            money before we get a lot of talent involved.
            I think people with money want to fund excitiing visible
            projects. Further, getting the attention of philanthropists on
            the real issue of public misunderstanding is a problem that
            has not been resolved in the context of the journalists and
            social scientists running interference for each other.

       Thank you.
       Just an fyi, the term "pro-Earthling" is being widened to refer to
       "all species", which will encourage general-public to hear it as
       touting what's been characterized as (and does contain some of) the
       environment-over-humans tribe.
       If you & others (self included) believe 1% of public understands
       the salient facts, what are the salient facts? Can we narrow them
       down to the fundamentals? (your 3 pts above are indeed fundamental,
       maybe there should be a SkepticalScience-type additional-info
       levels of presentation, beyond that?) Then can we test it please?
       Also - are the George Mason CCCC reports peer reviewed? (and if so,
       should the term "peer" be widened to include scientists? )
       > The Public "Understanding" of Science community cut its teeth on
       scientific communities acting in their own self-interest. [But]
       Climate scientists are not acting in their own self-interest at all
       when they try to communicate with the public.
       Yes.

            re: "Can we test it please?", yes, please.
            Again there is a problem of finding the people with the bona
            fides in the social sciences to do the study, the people in
            the physical sciences who understand why the study ought to be
            done, and the people in a position to fund it in the same
            room.
            In my own experience I seem to get a fair hearing from
            influential people until I start asking for money. Then they
            suddenly realize that I stubbornly refuse to fit into any
            fundable category and start ignoring me. So I've given up
            asking for money.
            So we'll have to find somebody else to do it.

       Is there any lineage connecting the present "Public Understanding
       of Science" types with the branch of Philosophy of Science that
       launched the so-called "Science Wars" of the 1990s? I realize it's
       quite different in some ways, but ... they're both examples of
       people who don't/can't actually do scientific research claiming
       some dominion or higher ground over those who do.

                 Ah, thanks. The funny thing is, the "Science Wars" struck
                 the dinner table conversations during my grad student
                 years (91-96) but at the time I was completely unaware
                 that the philosophy student who was babbling on about how
                 quantum mechanics was a social construct represented a
                 larger movement. It was only years later, in the
                 political context of some postmodernists effectively
                 saying "Sorry, our bad, we partly enabled the right
                 wing's total divorce from scientific reality" that I
                 learned about the wider "war". (Of course I heard about
                 Sokal at the time.) Anyway, just explaining that I didn't
                 immediately recognize what the reference to Latour was
                 about - but thanks, that lead to some interesting
                 reading.

            Yes it is my impression that this is very much a related
            community of social critiques of science, perhaps not as
            radical as Latour etc. but cut from a similar cloth. Latour is
            indeed cited in the volume which I have been studying and
            linked above.
            But also Jasanoff is cited, and she is in the same subculture
            as Pielke. So while the strident leftist critique is not
            universal, the schoolmarmish tendency to castigate scientists
            seems pretty endemic.

       Keeping in mind that I recently [83]voiced some thoughts not
       dissimilar from your point about swimming in your lane, there's
       actually quite a lot I disagree with here. (Note: I make no
       pretense of thinking my opinion is of great interest to anyone.)
       But let me focus on one topic:

     First, I fear it runs afoul of the old [84]lumping problem. The
     communicators interested in this stuff probably aren't the ones
     writing the cheesy, false-balance stories you're irritated about.
     Second, what follows from that is that it's ridiculous to think that
     "deficit model" concerns (if I maybe lump too many things together,
     now) are some comforting avoidance of culpability. What's the flip
     side of saying "lousy stories don't have that much of an impact"?
     That good stories don't, either. How does that make the people
     working hard to write good stories feel? So it's not a comforting
     position to hold, it's a humbling (and potentially discouraging)
     one.
     To your larger point, there's a substantial amount of research
     showing that people cannot, to a large degree, be informed if the
     issue is already polarized. The polarization controls their intake
     of information. The reason you see public opinion being reduced to
     "yes/no" is not because the speakers are lazy or naive, but because
     the data they've seen make them think that way. Active blogosphere
     skeptics calling for transparency or [flavor of the day] are not
     representative of the rest of the public which doesn't give much of
     a damn. There just don't seem to be many people out there with
     "nuanced" opinions. For most, it truly is "yes/no". Present them
     with some clear climate science, and one group will say "see? yes!"
     and the other will say "pffft. no!" That reality seems clear.

            Most of the people do not have a clear idea of what they are
            saying "no", or for that matter "yes" to. I wish people could
            at the least have a clear idea of what it is they are
            rejecting, or for that matter, accepting. It is that, not some
            sales pitch and whether or not they buy it, that I think is
            what we should be calling "public understanding of science".
            I am not going to give up on the "deficit model" not only
            because proper discussion of the evidence in public spheres
            has not yet happened. (I picked up the Washington Post today
            and scanned it for any mention of climate. I saw *not* *one*
            *word*. (UPDATE - actually there was a little piece about
            Obama's new solar panels, and the previous photo-ops when
            Carter installed some and Reagan subsequently removed them.
            But why you would want such things was not discussed.)) But
            also because the whole concept of a "deficit model" arose, as
            I describe here, in very different science communication
            contexts.

                 As I argued in the post I linked, I'm not giving up on
                 the "deficit model" style of communication, either, but
                 inherent in the definition of the deficit model is an
                 expectation that this will result in moving the public
                 opinion needle. (That's the sticky bit.) The evidence we
                 have tells us that won't happen- and that includes the
                 attempted indirect route of increasing understanding as
                 well as the direct route of persuading.
                 The concept of the deficit model is not so different from
                 the old-school (no pun intended) classroom approach- get
                 up, deliver the information, the students will be buckets
                 that receive it. We know that's not the best approach.
                 Highly motivated students will find what they need, most
                 will miss the boat. Simply presenting information does
                 not, on its own, reliably result in education.

                 Scott, it is in fact exactly the "move the needle"
                 concept that I am objecting to here.
                 The whole conversation presumes we know what "the needle"
                 is. It is designed by politicians and soap salesmen to
                 make their job easier. But it makes our job, of building
                 a genuine discourse about how to put the world together
                 in the future, all the harder. Once we boil things down
                 to a yes/no question, or even a one-dimensional
                 continuum, we have oversimplified the problem to the
                 point where most of the solution space to our real
                 problems disappears.
                 The PUS community interferes with actual public
                 understanding rather than promoting it by defining it in
                 this shallow way.
                 And while I appreciate Mike Mann's promoting this essay
                 on Twitter, I think by buying into Maibach's "six
                 Americas" taxonomy and saying "it's the folks in the
                 middle that we can reach" he's contributing to the
                 polarization and oversimplification.
                 A hundred years from now there will still be humans on
                 the planet and they will still have energy systems and
                 food systems and resource systems. How this pans out,
                 which could be very badly, depends hugely on what we do
                 now. Even the most laissez-faire approach to all this is
                 in fact entangled in international relations and
                 realpolitik. We have to find our way through this thicket
                 as a global community, and the only thing we know about
                 the next century with confidence is that the year 2113
                 will actually arrive, most likely and hopefully with a
                 lot of people in it.
                 We have to admit that the American right has the world by
                 the nuts, and that the less responsible parts of the
                 fossil fuel industry have the American right by the nuts
                 in turn. This grotesque situation seems both
                 unsustainable in the long run and in no likelihood of
                 fading out anytime soon. Roberts' idea that we have to
                 let it burn out on its own has some merit - there's not
                 much we can do to speed up its collapse by addressing it
                 directly.
                 But we can be tricked into reinforcing it. Reducing our
                 immense predicament to a one-dimensional tug-of-war plays
                 into the hands of those promoting stasis.
                 The complexity of our situation lacks precedent, and
                 drawing on historical experience offers limited guidance.
                 Reducing our wild circumstance to a single dimension
                 ("global warming yes or no") drives polarization in the
                 name of resolving it. When the actual underlying goal of
                 the polarization is merely academic reputation and turf,
                 it's a pathetic, shabby, and contemptible excuse for
                 reinforcing our incapacity to face the future.
                 What we need in the long run is not persuasion, but
                 engagement.

                 I can't help having a recurrent daytime nightmare that
                 all communications will have to be shut off before people
                 realize how unreal their addictions are. Advertisers and
                 marketing own the world. mt, I love it when you get

                 other stuff to do but it only took minutes to return to
                 their media once it was back.
                 Advertising and marketing rule the world, and it's not
                 clear anyone knows how to cut past it except in the
                 rarefied world where we waste our time (how many people

                 ones people will listen to - the country extension

                 However, ABC evening news did a good satellite special
                 last night - that reaches a few more people. Why do we

                 Let me say, though, that I remain unconvinced that the
                 "deficit model fallacy" is entirely valid. As with
                 economics, I think there is a confusion of small and
                 large signals. The experiments that are feasible to
                 conduct in a social science lab are much too small.
                 Of course you will not overcome cultural resistance with
                 a made-up article citing an actor dressed as a professor
                 with a made-up biography. Who would have suspected
                 otherwise?
                 We already know that cultures are shifted in a mass media
                 age by organized mass media. If I am a Fox viewer and
                 have seen a thousand hours of mocking climate science and
                 ten of halfhearted defenses of it, another half hour will
                 not sway the balance. Why do people think this proves
                 anything at all?
                 So many people forget Feynman's dictum that the easiest
                 person to fool is yourself. I wish the PUS people would
                 apply a little skepticism to their own cohort. But if
                 they won't, I will, and I encourage you to do so as well.

                 I have no idea why you say that. If you accept that
                 "global temperature is increasing" is one of the basic
                 facts you would like people to recognize, and that
                 assigning a high value of risk to climate change
                 represents a desire to see policy action (public opinion
                 needle), this is a defense of acceptance of basic facts
                 being firmly tied to the public opinion needle. (And
                 thus, "conflation" not being the issue.) Taken with the
                 mountain of evidence showing that the needle primarily
                 moves at the whim of tribal forces rather than
                 encountering good information about the science, you see
                 the problem.
                 Regardless, I'll drop it. I can see I'm not adding any
                 value here.

            Scott, we seem to be talking past each other. No great matter,
            I have seen quite a lot of that these past two days. That just
            means we're in the thick of things.
            Failing to understand your point I will rephrase mine in the
            light of what I understand of your objection:
            Clearly, those who believe things that flatly aren't true
            aren't going to be convinced otherwise by a single exposition
            of facts in print or in a lecture. Clearly those incorrect
            beliefs were foisted upon them by some socially dysfunctional
            process. And clearly those are predictive of a policy position
            that differs from that which I would prefer.
            On the other hand, you will find few skeptics of that sort
            among, say, forest fire fighters, or ski hill operators, or
            park rangers. That may be because that population doesn't
            overlap. Or it may be that by the nature of their work those
            people have information that is not consistent with that
            incorrect belief.
            Clearly such extreme misunderstanding is connected in some way
            with rejection. Nobody will support a huge public effort on a
            problem they misperceive as nonexistent. But this group, while
            it offers cover for the fossil fuel companies to manipulate
            politicans on the right and is therefore important, is
            relatively small. And it would not offer much cover if the
            vast majority of conservatives had better information.
            So I don't see how any of that argues otherwise than that what
            we need form a discipline of public understanding of science
            is how to present the science so the public is maximally able
            to understand it. If that process is slow and weak, that is
            unfortunate, but it seems clear that the objective should be
            to strengthen it and speed it up, not to give up and call
            something else "public understanding".

       Acceptance might be enough under certain circumstances (I don't
       need to know how vaccines work, I just need to accept the science
       and roll up my sleeve), but acceptance is not enough given the
       circumstances currently surrounding climate communication.
       The biggest problem as I see it, with mere acceptance of climate
       science is that it isn't the science that needs to be accepted in
       order for policy to move forwards. It is the consequences of
       inaction that need to be accepted, unfortunately the scale of the
       consequences are hard to grasp, both in terms of dollar value and
       on the time-scales involved.
       More importantly, acceptance of the consequences isn't nearly as
       powerful as an understanding of what those consequences will
       ultimately mean, and given that mitigation is not free, mere
       acceptance might not be enough to convince people to vote for
       policies that will cost real money today.

       href="[112]http://grist.org/politics/can-climate-science-be-rendere
       d-conservative-friendly/Can climate science be rendered
       conservative-friendly?.
       The answer is: "No".
       Information deficit doesn't work, they don't need no stinkin'
       information, especially not from when it comes from pointy-headed
       liberals.
       Reframing the problem as a security issue won't work because you
       settle security issues with big guns, not small cars or meat-free
       dinners. A public health framing does a little better, since
       conservatives love their children, too, but American conservatives
       haven't exactly shown a lot of far-sightedness on public health
       issues lately.
       Talking solutions is even less effective. The main reason that
       American conservatives don't accept climate change science is
       because they hate the solutions.
       Perhaps a class of trusted expert communicators will emerge, people
       who understand the science, the policy choices and can communicate
       all of this in a pre-Enlightenment ethical framework. Ha!
       Maybe people will gradually come to their senses, as they listen to
       their children and see with their own eyes that the climate really
       is changing. It has happened before, the once impossible became the
       irresistible on civil rights, on women's emancipation and it's
       happening now on gay marriage and drug decriminalization. It may
       only take another generation on climate change. If only we had
       another generation.
       Let's just focus on the uncommitted and the half-hearted. A big
       chunk of the US public is a lost cause, as are small parts of the
       public in other parts of the developed world. Let's stop wasting
       energy engaging them, except to staunch the flow of misinformation.

            Frankly I don't buy what Roberts is selling.

     it's just a fantasy that we can limit global temperature rise to 2
     degrees with nothing but a tax.
            With a small tax, I agree, but with a large enough tax, this
            could be achieved. Mark Jaccard gave an interview on Quirks
            and Quarks a few years ago mentioning that even a price on
            carbon that rises relatively quickly to $200 per tonne would
            only lead to a small increase in what we pay for energy (as
            the price of carbon rises, we would inevitable switch to lower
            carbon or carbon free sources of energy).
            I'll agree that this is currently a political non-starter, but
            such a tax could be designed to give conservatives exactly
            what they say they want.
            Ultimately there are too many conservatives for me to imagine
            a way of solving this issue without them. Sure short term
            victories are possible, but the problem is large enough that
            short term victories are not enough.
            The good news is that I don't think most conservatives are
            hardcore deniers, they just listen to the wrong people. Most
            conservatives probably can be reached, though obviously not
            all of them (I have little hope of Inhofe being reachable)

                 There are reasons, I think, that a tax is suboptimal. But
                 if any country wants to depend 100% on a revenue neutral
                 tax to pull their weight in the transition, I see no

                 carbon tax conservative. The anti-tax message has much
                 more resonance than the pro-market message.
                 Conservatism is as conservatism does, but more
                 importantly as liberalism does not. The only climate
                 solution of significant popularity among conservatives is
                 nuclear power. The only thing that will change this is
                 when a conservative bashes Obama for not supporting their

                 On a knee jerk level no doubt that a revenue neutral

                 the fact that such a tax is compatible with conservative

     If catastrophe strikes, would future geologists find evidence of New

                 readers. Or, while bad news sells, really bad news
                 perhaps doesn't. Here's what some scientist, [140]Niles
                 Eldredge [141]wrote in 2001:

     There is little doubt left in the minds of professional biologists
     that Earth is currently faced with a mounting loss of species that
     threatens to rival the five great mass extinctions of the geological
     past. As long ago as 1993, Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson estimated
     that Earth is currently losing something on the order of 30,000
     species per year --
                 That was [142]before climate disruption started
                 accelerating the 6th Great Extinction... (e.g. molding
                 Atelopus frogs). While New York might erode away, we have
                 already made a lasting imprint in the geologic record
                 (chemistry, fossil record). And (I know I don't need to
                 tell you) it will get much worse. This is just the humble
                 beginning of the obscene Anthropocene.
                 ---------------------------

     mt deplores my obsession with water vapor animations
                 Why that? Haven't noted.
                 I don't know more than you about this stuff, but my
                 intuitive halluzinations aren't always wrong: On the
                 surface, Arctic sea ice is for dead matter reductionists
                 (not - it's a complex system undergoing a phase
                 transition possibly this very year, alas mostly hidden
                 below the clouds). In contrast, the planetary water vapor
                 circulation gives a much more vivid image of the
                 liveliness of our planet. My hunch is that some
                 spectacular (beautiful and frightening) reconfiguration
                 of the circumpolar dance of whirls and wobbles and
                 streams will happen these very years, marking a new epoch
                 of climate change where climatology and meteorology meet.
                 In time lapse this might serve the iconic image of our
                 century, perhaps awakening a few folks like
                 [143]Earthrise did in 1968. Dreams! (I guess this can't

       A bit of your dialogue: "Climate folk: How can we get a critical
       mass of people to understand a dozen absolutely crucial points
       about the future of the planet? PUS folk: You must not do that
       because it is bad."
       Does anyone really say that? I'm confused. I just read Kahan saying
       that he'd only accept an approach that empowered people to make
       informed decisions, not one that promoted blind acceptance of
       scientific authority. Are are you saying that's not what he really
       thinks?
       This is your crux para for me: "Just as economists, without much
       success to show for themselves, nevertheless claim sovereignty over
       the final decisions we make as a society on how to manage carbon,
       so do the `public understanding of science' people claim
       sovereignty over the question of, well, `public understanding of
       science'."
       An interesting little snippet from [147]this Krugman paper where he
       explains his approach to sticking geography into his
       Nobel-prize-winning core-periphery model: "in a crude sense,
       mainstream economics isn't going away: like it or not, the White
       House has a Council of Economic Advisers, not a Council of
       Geographical Advisers, the World Bank hires lots of economists and
       not many geographers, and so on". I'd add, the World Bank has also
       done a great deal of world developing a finance ministry state
       structure where a certain economic approach is thoroughly plugged
       into power.
       Which is all to say - you're absolutely right, economics does claim
       that sovereignty. But attacking economics is not going to change
       that. If you've been following any of Krugman's exasperated blog
       posts tracking which economic ideas embedded into post-crisis
       politicians' ears, I guess you'd know that.
       So...? So I'm wondering what it is you're getting at. What do you
       think should happen? Does your article presume that changing public
       perception is key to achieving a successful climate policy? Or
       should we working out which people and institutions steer
       decisions? Political power is massively multi-polar; it's
       connection to academia equally messy and - as the Krugman quote
       shows - economics is the social science discipline most embedded in
       those power structures and thus probably the most immobile.
       Do you think we have to worry about any of that, or should... I say
       "we", sorry: do you think scientists should worry about any of
       that?
       I also suspect "public understanding" is not the main problem. I
       don't think political systems are currently set up to "understand"
       our predicament either. Last year I went to two workshops in quick
       succession: one [148]clearly laying out the physical severity of
       what we face, where politicians were invited to talk about it (none
       came); the other [149]a gathering of science/social science bods
       and policymakers. The two-degree target dominated the latter; it's
       a global governance juggernaut that rolls over everything else.
       Random point: "do we really want to allow corporate dominance of
       our food supply by granting intellectual property rights on our
       principal crops? Not a question that scientific defense of GMOs
       tends to take up."
       Yeah, it does. Loads of people at Rothamsted - the publicly funded
       institution at the centre of the last big GM argument whose
       research was threatened - have been making the case that GMO is a
       good tech and, by supporting public work on it, it's more likely to
       remain in the public domain. Conversely, most people attacking GM
       confuse it with "corporate control of the food system" - those two
       are no more intrinsically linked than "software" is to Microsoft or
       Apple. I'm a bit surprised to see you blur GM and corporate control
       as well.

            I think you should take a closer look at what Monsanto does
            and their "domination" model. I am not kidding.
            In addition, providing seeds that must be bought every year is
            about profit, not about helping people.
            It seems that some of the older varieties of seed now being
            restored are actually more effective with some of the extreme
            conditions we are seeing.
            Monocultures are not healthy, and that is what Monsanto
            promotes, a monoculture with them in the only driver's seat.

                 Sorry to be going O/T... I completely agree with you -
                 that's what I was saying. I am against corporate
                 domination of the food system, I'm not against GM. The
                 two are not synonymous. Loads of publicly funded research
                 into GM is taking place and it should be supported, not
                 attacked or tarred with the same brush (even though
                 obviously there's some overlap between people).
                 [155]Here's an open letter I wrote about that last year.
                 Computing is still dominated by closed models: originally
                 Microsoft and now Apple's walled garden of apps. Doesn't
                 mean you should reject computing. And I'm not saying
                 there aren't risk issues but AFAIK AAAALLL GM scientists
                 are very clear that they're low to non-existent...
                 ... and probably no more dangerous than the previous (now
                 untraceable) approach, which was/is to just
                 [156]irradiate the bejeesus outa a bunch of seeds, grow
                 them and select favourable traits. There are plant labs
                 where people do that because it's not regulated in the
                 same way GM is, so it's still in some ways more
                 practical. But few people talk about that because it's
                 not been made into a bogeyman in the same way GM has.

                 Yes, that's almost certainly true (your last phrase, that
                 is). Monsanto has a mandate, enforced by an army of
                 shareholders' rights attorneys, to operate in the
                 interest of increasing shareholder value via sustainable
                 competitive advantage and what you describe, if it's
                 successful, will surely achieve that (at least in the
                 intermediate term). And some of their abuses (imho) of
                 the legal system are reprehensible.
                 But that's not really connected to public understanding
                 of science, it's more to do with public influence (lack
                 thereof, actually) on policy and legal remedies.
                 Certainly, this is a subject well worth discussing and
                 well worth the time and effort of P3 participants to
                 discuss. But I see it as pretty much entirely distinct
                 from PUS and the deficit model. I had that reaction to
                 the original quote in the post ("Do we really want to
                 allow corporate dominance of our food supply by granting
                 intellectual property rights on our principal crops? Not
                 a question that scientific defense of GMOs tends to take
                 up."). It's a valid and worthy question for discussion
                 but not really related directly to PUS.
                 So, is the question at hand "is the deficit model really
                 a fallacy?" or is it "what can be done to bring `the
                 public' to a level of demand that it can have an effect
                 on public policy?" In my clearly informal and
                 non-rigorous "survey" of those with whom I regularly
                 interact, most are "sympathetic" to the climate change
                 issue in the sense described above but have much more
                 immediate concerns. Those who aren't "sympathetic" are
                 typically those who don't even know there's an issue. I
                 know, at a personal level, not a lot of people who are
                 aware that there may be an issue but are unsympathetic.

            [159]August 17, 2013 at 5:40 pm
            1) This essay is overlong as it stands. It originally began
            with a lengthy quote of Kahan's statement of support for
            reasoned discourse, and my unmitigated approval of it.
            Once he starts talking about Stossel he demonstrates an
            incapacity to actually act in support of the sort of discourse
            he claims to support. I indeed do not think Kahan is serious
            about this stance.
            2) Who is we? Again, I am happy to use the collective noun in
            the sense of "us Earthlings". I feel that separating the world
            into "scientists" and "non-scientists" is part of the problem,
            not part of the solution. But we could all benefit from more
            science-like thinking.
            3) The changes we need are too big to defer to the usual power
            brokers. This is part of Roger's confusion. We need public
            support of a sort that cannot be had without reduction of the
            existing information deficit, It's not as if this stuff were
            dull, either, but it requires thinking at a large scale that
            people are not used to. Those of us who understand the
            outlines of the problem, then, must ignore those who say it is
            pointless to communicate it.
            4) Countries that accept the 2 C target are well ahead of us
            on this side of the pond. I think if you have acceptance of
            that you still need broad understanding of the actual policy
            implications of that. But obviously the right in the US, and
            increasingly in other countries, in alliance with the fossil
            fuel industry, is doing a good job preventing the whole world
            from moving forward. (It remains to be seen whether the
            Chinese will continue to talk a good talk without walking a
            good walk.)
            5) The point is that GMO scientists are, in the Tamsinesque
            way, not especially qualified to discuss whether the
            government can work these tools in a more ethical way than
            Monsanto, or whether they must be avoided altogether. It is
            all beside the point of any particular organism. And here the
            PUS community has been notably insightful and helpful. My
            point here is that they are using the same hammer and climate
            is a very different sort of nail.
            6) I'd like it if someone wrote a GMO article for P3 that we
            could nucleate a serious conversation about. I am not that
            well-informed on it and do not have solid opinions on it. I'd
            appreciate if we didn;t let that topic hijack this particular
            thread, though.

                 Agreed. I kind of thought that that was what I was
                 saying.
                 I (egotistically) look at myself as a bellwether of
                 sorts. I do so because of my lifestyle, my business, my
                 level of understanding (less than ANYONE involved in
                 climate science per se but more than the average
                 layperson), my conservative leanings, etc. So, when I
                 discuss "sympathetic but with more immediate concerns,"
                 to a certain extent I'm self-reporting.
                 It's hard to see how more education will change me. And
                 yet me and my family (there are four of us), as best I
                 can calculate, are responsible for the emission of
                 something like[163]96 tons of CO2 per year. And it's not
                 getting much smaller, despite my 52 m.p.g.
                 Though my comprehension of the problem is fairly good, it
                 hasn't changed much about what I do in a given day, week,
                 or month. Fundamentally, it's what I refer to as the
                 "hamburger problem." I KNOW that a diet of hamburgers and
                 fries will shorten my life, and may make its final stages
                 worse than they need be. But THIS hamburger won't make a
                 bit of difference. Similarly, I KNOW that the profligate
                 emission of GHGs will lead to a dark future but THIS
                 individual (me) not flying my airplane, not traveling to
                 the east coast by air to arpa-e conferences, not buying
                 "stuff," won't make a bit of difference.
                 So the problem is how to get people to act as a group
                 against a common enemy, regardless of how well they
                 understand the problem. The last time I know of that this
                 happened in the U.S. was the common sacrifice during WW2.
                 I listen to Radio Classics on Sirius XM (old time radio
                 drama, comedy, etc.) and they not only play the old
                 shows, they play the old commercials. You can hear ads on
                 how to use your gas rationing tickets, etc. Was the
                 public educated about Japan, Germany, etc.? I think the
                 average person of that era knew little of the
                 geopolitics, but the did know the enemy.
                 Sadly, that enemy made himself an immediate threat by
                 attacking Pearl Harbor. I'm not sure what will bring the
                 enemy to our doorstep in this case, at least while it's
                 early enough to matter. How will better education of the
                 public at large on scientific issues and scientific
                 thinking change this? We need a common enemy at our
                 doorstep.

       Thanks Horatio, always the mot juste! Not sure your imagery works
       right side foremost, though. The more I look at this stuff the
       dizzier it gets. Do I mean ditzier?
       All this communication about communication is going nowhere very
       very very very slowly.
       Scientists think more facts will fix it. Psychologizers think
       better psychology will fix it. Everybody wants an honest broker,
       and some people are pretending they know how to do that but they
       are often the least honest of all. Everybody is desperately
       worried, but nobody's allowed to say so for fear of scaring the
       horses. I call baloney.
       Then ALEC and its tame tea party dittoheads are busy fixing it, as
       in "the fix is in." Anti-science climate jackals and vultures are
       busy everywhere with their carrion (this image is also backwards,
       but I'm sure my meaning is clear).
       For example: [176]How JPMorgan, ALEC & The Koch Brothers Are
       Helping Turn Police Forces Into Corporate Goons "keeping
       undesirables (reporters and activists) at bay"
       and

       Chicago This Week
       Michael Tobis doesn't like Fiore, but I love those fact-filled
       shorties and find this long-winded stuff self-indulgent. Any kind
       of short presentation that pushes facts front and center is
       helpful. I think my link to the article about the Palisades was too
       light on substance.
       In any case, reaching outside one's own lane is imperative if one
       is to have a future beyond the next small number of decades (we
       could argue - I'd say two, and the scientists are plumping for
       three or more, decades, that is).

       It is not the message that is the problem IMO it is the lack of
       "money" to buy mass media that ignore any points put forth other
       than the status quo of the "socially enabled capitalistic"
       paradigm. The fundamental flaw with Western Capitalism, IMO, is the
       ability of the few to profit from the pollution of the commons as
       "We the People" are left holding the clean-up bag. Clearly
       privatized profits and socialized loses is a failed paradigm. Any
       Nation that places no dollar value on Earth's life support systems,
       (unless one throws a gum wrapper on the street), and lets the
       oceans become acidified, climate destabilized, rivers and dirt
       polluted and more, only to insure the GDP climbs, has become
       chained to oblivion in the long run. Socially enabled capitalism
       eats its young and is even working on the life support of future
       generations.
       Stop profits from the pollution of the commons. Not any job, only
       green jobs can begin to lift the nations of this exploited world
       from the morass bequeathed humanity at this point. Black jobs only
       dig the hole deeper. Go Green. Resistance is fatal to Earth's life
       support systems.
       The GOP do not support abortion with their tax money. Fine. A
       precedent. Why do "we" tolerate the funding with billions of our
       tax dollars, the ecocide of the Planet?

       MT: "The point is that GMO scientists are, in the Tamsinesque way,
       not especially qualified to discuss whether the government can work
       these tools in a more ethical way than Monsanto, or whether they
       must be avoided altogether."
       Perhaps not, but are plant scientists not qualified to say what the
       impact of cultivars is most likely to be? I would say they are.
       There are obvious differences to assessing the impact of sticking
       carbon into the atmosphere - but there are also a lot of
       similarities, and those become stronger the further down the causal
       chain you get towards nonlinear risks and feedbacks.
       So I'm not quite sure I understand your point here, would you be
       able to elaborate a bit more? You may have strong views about the
       science that, as a non-scientist, it would be good for me to
       understand. I'm not really seeing the difference - and on a first
       read, it actually sounded like you're saying "climate scientists
       should be heeded but plant scientists should defer to the public",
       which makes no sense to me.

     "on a first read, it actually sounded like you're saying "climate
     scientists should be heeded but plant scientists should defer to the
     public", which makes no sense to me.
            Sort of, but it's not as capricious as it sounds.
            I'm saying that professional organizations advocating for
            their own interests should indeed be discounted, far more than
            professional organizations speaking in the public interest,
            more or less orthogonal to their own interests.
            It seems likely to me that both American climate science
            collectively and NASA/space would be much more vibrant today
            had there been no controversy.
            It may well be the case that some individuals within the
            academy benefitted in their own careers from stirring up
            controversy. To my eye these hangers-on mostly make centrist
            plays or naysayer plays rather than consensus plays.
            Regardless, had those cards not been on the table they'd have
            benefitted from something else.
            But did the field, the core interest of the professional
            society, benefit? This is unlikely.
            Consequently when AMS or AGU or their equivalents on your side
            of the pond make policy recommendations that don't directly
            affect their funding or workflow, they deserve a different
            sort of hearing than if they do.
            Crucially, our goals in this endeavor are NOT to win a
            particular funding battle or improve the funding environment
            or promote our line of business. Our goal is to ensure that
            the public discourse is suitably well-informed about our
            findings.
            The GMO scientists are probably telling the truth that
            specific GMOs are harmless. But they confuse that assertion
            (which many disbelieve) with the actual question at hand,
            which is how the next million years of life on earth is to be
            conducted, not whether we should stick carotene in our rice. .
            "Surely", they believe, "we can convince the public that this
            pretty funny-colored rice is harmless".
            This confusion is the deficit model fallacy
            Counter-GMO activists will, of course, be satisfied if people
            believe "GMOs, yuck!" of which "vitamin-enhanced rice,
            unhealthy" is surely a subset. So they are politicizing the
            discourse, by not challenging incorrect beliefs which support
            their policy. But the GMO promoters stubbornly refuse to
            engage on the real problem. So we have a fake debate. But here
            the advice of the Kahan sect to the GMO advocates is at least
            salient: you are not engaging the public on its real issues
            which are values-based not facts-based.
            The motivation of the climate science community is strictly
            Jeffersonian - an informed public can manage its affairs
            better than an ill-informed public. We seek a well-informed
            public. It is one thing to disagree with the public's
            decisions. It is quite an other to see the public blundering
            on the basis of some few key misunderstandings.

                 You point to a contradiction between those who advocate
                 that scientists should carefully frame their arguments
                 for specific audiences and those (perhaps sometimes the
                 same people) who say that scientists should just stick to
                 the facts.
                 Culturally-sensitive framing is, of course, nothing if it
                 is not advocacy, since it is designed to appeal to
                 people's prejudices-or at least not to provoke
                 instinctive rejection reactions-in order to persuade.
                 Advocacy isn't bad of course and it could be said that
                 all of our arguments are advocacy, whether we make them
                 in a peer-reviewed journal or a TV commercial.
                 Somebody once told me: "Remember, we are all in sales".
                 That seemed crass and cynical at first, but it's true.
                 With almost every thing we say or write, we are trying to
                 sell something; an idea, a product, ourselves.
                 What I have found is that many people who decry the
                 deficit model appeal to facts when trying to bludgeon the
                 deficit model itself, rather than carefully framing their
                 own case so that it doesn't threaten the cultural
                 cognition of the people who naturally think that facts
                 matter most. The underlying asymmetry here is that the
                 cultural cognition people, mostly themselves liberals,
                 seem to believe that culturally sensitive messaging is
                 only needed for conservatives. Progressives who might be
                 irrationally opposed to GMO's need to be clobbered with
                 facts and the scientific consensus, whereas when you are
                 talking about climate change to Christian conservatives,
                 it's a good idea to dissemble on the age of the Earth,
                 lest you turn the audience off.
                 I wrote a comment on Keith Kloor's blog a few month's
                 ago, pointing out that he believes in a softly-softly
                 approach in selling climate science, but wields a facts
                 bludgeon when bashing the hippies who fear GMO's.

                 I particularly enjoy the clarity in this (both Tobis and
                 Skuce) except for the term "deficit model" which is
                 unfamiliar to me. In the midst of roiling information
                 about so many different problems, I resist educating
                 myself as to what it means.
                 The idea that without conflict NASA and climate science
                 would be more vibrant particularly resonates for me. I
                 have chosen to do battle with some paid deniers and their
                 tactics are disgusting and to a large extent effective.
                 Their continuous efforts to marginalize anyone who
                 effectively calls out their bullshit are wearying and
                 sadly effective. In addition, they are skilled at setting
                 us at odds with each other. Real conversations would be
                 much richer without these diversions.
                 I would note that I am not against GMOs in principle, but
                 the Monsanto tactics move into the realm of psychopathy
                 that we find so often in big powerful entities of control
                 these days. It muddies the issues and prevents
                 development of true benefits.
                 Avoiding making a separate post, in case Martin Gisser is
                 reading, yes, I didn't show him the article, just brought
                 up the Palisades and he talked about that volcanic
                 geology which he said extends all the way to the gut of
                 Nova Scotia. The Princeton area that used to be
                 underwater is the end of the Atlantic rift valley. I
                 understand that he has been able to picture these events
                 (upheavals?) as living things, and wish my understanding
                 could approach that level for all the earth sciences. I
                 wish I had known that at this end of my life I would
                 become so fascinated by earth systems, so I would not
                 have wasted the bits of my education along the way. My
                 mind has fossilized and I don't absorb these new ideas
                 the way I have come to understand line, color, pigment,
                 and composition, which is instinctive with me, especially
                 after years of teaching. There's nothing like trying to
                 impart knowledge to solidify it in one's own mind.

                 This conversation has a tendency to wander off into so
                 many directions at once (not that it seems all that clear
                 to begin with, at least to me) that I think you need to
                 be precise about what you're trying to say. I don't think
                 it's advocacy or framing or sales to tell people that
                 their drinking water must be treated because it contains
                 organisms that cause water-borne disease. Part of the
                 problem is the mental baggage that each term (advocacy,
                 framing, sales) carries with it. Telling surgeons that
                 they need to wash their hands between patients in the
                 19th Century may have been a sort of professional
                 "advocacy" but I don't think of it as framing or sales.
                 At the time, what other steps could a surgeon take to
                 prevent infection while working on patients? Telling
                 people exactly how to go about dealing with real issues
                 that follow from new accurate information about how the
                 world works may turn into advocacy or framing or sales
                 but that is a matter of how to deal with the problem
                 rather than of what is going on out in the world and why
                 you should do something.
                 I have not kept up with the nature of the "problems" that
                 GMO's are intended to solve and I don't trust Monsanto to
                 do anything but find new ways to increase its profits. My
                 initial presumption is that anything that Monsanto does,
                 no matter how it may look on an immediate or superficial
                 basis and no matter what good or bad effect it may
                 ultimately have on others, is "sales" and the sole
                 intention is corporate profit for Monsanto alone. I
                 strongly, and with good reason, suspect that Monsanto's
                 corporate charter specifically says that Monsanto exists
                 solely to make a profit by any legal means, so what else
                 should I expect from them? The actual science of GMO's is
                 not an issue for me (yet).
                 My impression, based on the best current (scientific)
                 information I'm aware of, is that climate is a major
                 problem and we must do something, and the only real
                 question is how we deal with it. My impression of this
                 discussion is that MT believes that people must first be
                 informed that there is a climate problem (the water is
                 contaminated and if you drink it you will get sick?;
                 smoking is causing cancer?; ticks can transmit disease?)
                 using as much basic (and, as it happens, scientific)
                 information as may be appropriate or necessary, after
                 which we can all discuss how to deal with it with better
                 odds that something useful will actually be done. MT does
                 not believe that the majority of people have this
                 information, and that all this talk about framing and
                 what amounts to sales and public relations is cart before
                 horse stuff. Is that right?
                 What is the best approach to this? Is it like a war, or
                 the New Deal, or a public health "campaign" that is
                 intended to stop a communicable disease rather than sell
                 a new medical product, or what? A "war effort" approach
                 seems like it requires at least one commonly held belief
                 in a clear goal (win the war, defeat the enemy) and
                 leadership in that one direction. Multiple issues don't
                 count much unless one of them gets so big that the war
                 effort is derailed. Does that fit? As for other
                 approaches, I think one complication is that it is not
                 like the situation where an individual person may
                 contract a disease and thus has a specific incentive to
                 act for their own or their family's immediate benefit
                 even though the big picture is "public" health. It looks
                 like it's more a "Tragedy of the Commons" situation than
                 anything else and, offhand, my impression is that people
                 have historically done really badly with that sort of
                 problem. Any of that work for anybody?

                 for a sensible policy to emerge.
                 I don't think the polls that show "65 % support" for
                 "doing more" amounts to much; there's enough support for
                 token actions, but not enough support for a serious

                 You have done an excellent job of cutting through the BS
                 here, and imo deserve a compliment. It is complicated by
                 the existence of paid advocacy that has nothing to do
                 with truth or humankind's best interests. The waters are
                 muddied, and people like us who love to talk and write
                 are tempted to temporize where action is what is needed.
                 But action has been tried, and as you can see with the US
                 House of Representatives, progress is impossible. They
                 are planning to have some kind of show trials of climate
                 science in September, and call in "experts" who are
                 anything but, who have been legitimized in the halls of
                 money and power (see Curry, Judith for example; Greenfyre
                 put it as well as anyone, and I hear she's on NPR today,
                 representing the phony "middle"):

     What I found is that while Curry claims to want to build bridges,
     she is going about it with a flame thrower. Her approach, whether
     intentional or not, is a recipe to make matters far worse, and it's
     working!

       A lot of interesting ideas here but many are bereft of the help
       otherwise afforded by the domain known as social science. As well,
       the entire discussion might strike some (me, for instance*) as
       loaded with poorly veiled contempt for research domains outside of
       the "hard sciences." The juxtaposition is ironic given the
       motivation of the discussion.
       The problem of the Stossel equivocation rings true. The rest is not
       so obvious and is lacking enough known or correctly expressed
       variables to produce a useful result.
       The observer effect doesn't preclude hard science from making
       useful predictions about the behavior of gases and myriad other
       collectives that defy comprehensive scrutiny of any given member.
       Similarly, experiments can be made to yield useful predictive tools
       for describing the behavior of what we call living organisms,
       including humans. Both levels and fields of inquiry (social science
       being an example of truly hard science given the intelligently
       uncooperative nature of its subject) can be communicated in ways
       making them useless for the public good. One is more prone to that
       than the other, arguably because it's harder for us to think about,
       a harder subject.
       *I'm pretty sure I've said all of this before; as a spouse of a
       social scientist who has been forced to read N+1 drafts of
       publications it's hard not to be disturbed when encountering such a
       casserole of speculation and insult, seasoned with a dangerously
       small amount of knowledge. A dish mostly of what shouldn't be

            fancy math, of course, but their domain is fundamentally much
            trickier.)

                 Reading my comment now- too late- I think it's a bit
                 accusatory and harsh. As my excuse I claim adverse
                 conditioning caused by reading too many Feynman quotes in
                 connection with careless remarks about other, foreign
                 areas of expertise (it seems to me that Feynman's own
                 problem was that he felt a little too free to cast
                 judgement outside his domain but as others have noted
                 he's hardly alone on that within his own province).
                 But, damn it, I see Michael actually mentioned Feynman
                 above! Maybe my hypothesis about my own behavior is
                 confirmed?? :-)
