The Slot Machine Theory of Paper Submissions

   Why do scientists publish so much? There is the whole "publish or
   perish" thing but that doesn't explain the large increase in quantity
   of publications. With a focus on important publications and measures
   like H-indices, a simple publication in a conference often won't help
   someone's career. Yet we continue to publish as much as we can. Why?
   When you play a slot machine and you win, you get lights, music, sounds
   of coins coming out of the machine. If you lose, nothing. Lots of
   positive feedback if you win with no negative feedback if you don't.
   If you submit a paper and it gets accepted into a conference, you feel
   excited. Excited to see your name on the list of accepted papers.
   Excited to update your CV and to give that talk or poster that only
   those few who's paper was accepted get to give.
   If your paper is rejected, nothing. You don't list rejected papers on
   your CV. Nobody will even know you submitted the paper. And you can
   just take that paper and submit it to another conference. Lots of
   positive feedback if your paper is accepted with no negative feedback
   if it isn't.
   Some people might argue the analogy doesn't work since slot machines
   are arbitrary and random. Those people have never seen a program
   committee in action.

       Lance, I'm sorry to hear that gambling problems are so wide-spread
       in our community. There are resources for people who find
       themselves addicted to the blinking rejection/acceptance emails
       (perhaps conference submission pages should have a hotline posted
       for serial submitters who want help?).
       > Yet we continue to publish as much as we can. Why?
       There is something to be said for the theory that people write and
       submit so many papers because of irrational emotional reasons. But
       I disagree with the slot machine version of the theory, for a few
       reasons:
       1)
       > With a focus on important publications and measures like
       H-indices,
       > a simple publication in a conference often won't help someone's
       career.
       For better or for worse, I don't think that's the case. Depending
       on where you are in your career (and depending on who is reading
       your CV), an extra publication or two can make a big difference in
       your job prospects -- think of grad students applying for postdocs
       or faculty jobs.
       Since many papers involve grad students and postdocs, this factor
       comes into play a lot, I suspect.
       2) When you start a research project, it's hard to tell whether it
       will turn into something major. Often you take on a question, solve
       (part of) it, and realize that you have a paper that is not
       Godel-prize material but still nice. What do you do with it? Your
       post suggests you should not even bother to write it up, but why
       get something out of your efforts so far? (And also why not tell
       the world about what you have learned? Maybe someone else will turn
       it into something more interesting.)
       3) I hate slot machines. (But I continue to write papers, even
       occasionally ones that are not Godel prize material.)

       1) Maybe we should have rejected papers on the CV :-)
       2) When you work on a problem and make progress you might THINK
       that you
       won't get futher so you submit. It gets turned down. Then you DO
       make some mor pogress (perhaps with a new co-author). So you submit
       and you don't think of it as the same paper. This can go on for a
       while. OR it can even get in
       and you submit an improvement. So TIMING can be an issue.

       If your paper is rejected, nothing.
       Clearly, you are a better man than I. For most people, rejection
       hurts, Umeshisms notwithstanding.

       When I saw the title of this post I thought it was going to be
       about how random and arbitrary many program committee decisions
       are, and how that encourages us to keep re-submitting the same
       rejected papers to more conferences in hopes of a luckier outcome.

       Another important reason that Lance forgot to mention is the
       pressure to publish coming from the funding model in the US. To get
       a grant it is important to have "recent" and "fair" number of
       publications. The grant is for a specific "project" which means
       that one can get more money by having more projects which means
       more publications. And so on. There are of course advantages for
       this model as well but I believe that it drives to some extent the
       publication culture.

       I'm with Adam -- there are a variety of reasons to write papers,
       and "slot-machines" doesn't seem like the right analogy to me.
       To start, I think you're confusing the question a bunch. It seems
       like underlying your question is not, "Why do we write small-result
       papers?" but "Why do we do so much small-result research?" Often,
       once we do the small-result research, we write it up and publish it
       as an act of completion, so we can feel done with it and move on.
       That's a fine thing; what may be a small result may lead someone to
       a larger result later on, so better to write it down that not, I'd
       think, although one might argue it's not the best use of time.
       As to why we do small-result research, again, there are lots of
       reasons, some pointed out here. Training of students is one. (And
       again, that's a good reason for going through the writing process
       as well.) Not knowing ahead of time whether a result will be "big"
       or not is another. The desire to make some sort of steady (if
       small) continuous progress rather than aim for paradigm-breaking
       jumps every time out comes into play.

       It is actually good that people make their results available for
       others. I hurts more when you do something and later learn that
       someone has already done it some decades ago but has not published
       it. So writing these up and making them available for others is not
       a bad thing.
       The question is why people submit these small results to good
       conferences? Why not just pot them on arXiv? When we invest in
       something we normally want to get as much as we can. That is
       normal. Part of the problem is that if these works are not
       published in a good conference there is no positive feedback. It is
       an all-or-nothing situation. Either we publish in a good conference
       and get the stamp on it or we don't get anything, they don't count.
       It is not just the lack of negative incentives for rejected papers,
       it is also the lack of positive incentives and appreciation for
       good and reasonable but not awesome research. We often forget that
       most results are combination of several small ideas that have
       appeared in not paradigm-breaking works. We tend to think of
       paradigm-breaking results as wonders made by a single or few
       authors in vacuum without much attention to small ideas that they
       have borrowed from various places and people.
       In this situation, it is expected that people will try the only way
       of getting a positive feedback. A negative feedback for rejected
       works may reduce such submissions but a more fair solution is to
       change the game so it is not an all-or-nothing situation. For
       example, submitting small but nice results on arXiv should count
       and have a reasonable positive feedback on people's careers.
       As usual, this is not an issue for awesome ground-breaking work,
       nor for works of too low quality. The issue is for the gray area
       between them where deciding what to accept and what to reject is
       influenced significantly by factors other than the quality of the
       works and therefore looks random from outside. Punishing these
       rejected papers which had similar chances to the accepted papers
       further is not a good solution.

       How old is the H-index concept? Five years?
       What is a "good" H-index? Imagine that I have done a solid
       dissertation and published one rock solid paper each year of being
       an assistant professor that is cited by dozens of people each year.
       I am coming up for tenure review. My H-index doesn't hit
       double-digits. My competition has been publishing 5 papers a year,
       many of which cite others he has written. Even without anyone ever
       citing one of his papers other than him, he has an H-index of 12.
       I have better results. He has more papers and a better H-index. Who
       looks better to colleagues who don't know my area? To the Dean's
       office? The President's office?

       The real problem is not small results or repeated submission. The
       real problem is the culture of computer science that insists that
       we waste hundreds of hours on deciding what the "good" papers that
       "deserve acceptance" are at "prestigious" conferences. Why don't we
       act like mathematicians, who hold conferences where pretty much
       everyone gets a turn to speak (unless the results are true
       crackpottery, and sometimes even then)? After all, good papers will
       get cited and be influential whether or not they appear at
       "prestigious" conferences. Nowadays the real action is on the arxiv
       anyway, isn't it?

       Nice post, lance.
       I think there is room for publication models to address some of
       these issues? One approach is to have, say, all submissions appear
       on arxiv or some other central repository, and reviews then also
       appear with these papers. This has weaknesses (just keep revising
       until all obvious "weaknesses" in a fundamentally lame idea are
       bandaided), but in general computers+internet offer opportunities
       not yet being fully exploited. I should note of course that ideas
       like this are in circulation
       http://yann.lecun.com/ex/pamphlets/publishing-models.html , and
       being experimented with.
       My own view (perhaps too obvious/simplistic) is that the
       "randomness" is an inevitable side effect of the level of
       competition. Basically there are a few things that are "automatic
       in" for various reasons (interest in the topic, technical quality,
       go ahead and add your favorite reasons), but then most things are
       in the gray area (I'm imagining a gaussian: most mass is
       effectively in a block near the median), and no one can really
       identify if the literature is better with one or the other. Same
       deal with faculty hiring and basically anything else with this
       low-acceptance rate....... As such, all we can really hope for is
       that the definite-ins are not discarded, and the gray area will
       slowly sort itself out.
       I do think the system could use constant overhauls/vigilance. I
       think it is good to worry that small results are over-emphasized,
       and also that the system is gamed in far too many ways.

       It seems like a high publication count is needed to get hired -- or
       even interviewed -- for academic positions (though obviously it is
       not sufficient). Can someone provide a single example of someone
       who was recently hired at a top school who didn't have a large
       number of publications? At CMU for example, it looks like pretty
       much everyone giving job talks has 15+ papers from grad school
       alone.

       If your paper is rejected, nothing.
       Maybe true if you are a long tenured professor. But if you are a
       grad student, you invested 12 months of life into doing the work
       and the clock is ticking until you need to graduated and move on.
       Putting nothing on your CV doesn't make this happen.
       With a focus on important publications and measures like H-indices
       I find this somewhat contradictory: everyone I know that has a high
       H-index publishes lots of papers. If you write something that is
       really important, there are plenty of good reasons to write a
       flurry of offshoot papers. They may not be groundbreaking or
       difficult, but will help guide at least a subset of your prior
       audience.

       I am a graduate student who moved to CS from pure maths and I don't
       see one good reason to publish papers that are incremental. Maybe,
       my voice is insignificant in front of big names who have already
       commented above me, but I feel responsible to the community to make
       my point. Personally, I prefer submitting to journals rather than
       conferences. I am fine having 3 good publications than 15
       insignificant one.
       I feel that if the hiring process is so much directed by numbers of
       papers rather than number of significant papers, computer science
       department at such schools needs to do some introspection. I will
       cite Harold Stark story of how he got tenured at MIT. His graduate
       thesis is on one of Gauss' conjecture. He did not had many results
       in 4-5 years post graduation, but then he proved the Gauss
       conjecture and got tenured at MIT.
       2. On the point of getting paper rejected or accepted. We further
       need to scrutinize the fact why papers with some subtle errors gets
       accepted. This is again due to the "incentive" of getting accepted
       paper in top venue. Frankly speaking, PC cannot give so much time
       to proof-read 40-50 pages. I believe, as a community, we should
       understand our responsibility to submit papers when we are
       "thoroughly" convince that every step of your proof is correct. PC
       should be just delegated to weigh if our work is better enough to
       be in 30 odd papers that will end up being accepted.
       One personal experience: in one of the conference, I was discussing
       with two tenure track professors (say X and Y) about one of their
       coauthored paper. Incidentally, X and Y was wrong in citing the
       major contribution of its own work and when I showed the paper, the
       response of one of the faculty was, "I don't remember what I worked
       at that time." The paper was published online in 2010 and I was
       talking to the faculty in 2012. If you cannot remember what you
       worked on two years back, think twice if you really worked on it!
       That sums up my frustration because as a graduate student, I need
       to do background reading covering many such papers.
