   Microsoft's Reversal on Windows 8.1 Suggests New Organization is
   working better than the old one did.
   This is the Thesis of my ITBusiness Edge entry this week. Firms with
   structures like Microsoft had tend to focus on blame and the end result
   is an inability to correct mistakes before they become disasters. But
   Microsoft heard back from developers that their move to block them from
   RTM was a bad idea and relatively quickly reversed themselves
   recognizing that doing it right was better than pretending that what
   you are doing isn't wrong. This may seem simple but it is an element
   that often seemed absent in the old Microsoft and I'm seeing behavior
   that suggests it will be common in the new firm. That is clearly a
   hopeful step in the right direction. Read the full piece in
