Apple Expected to Sell 5 Million to 8 Million iPhones This Weekend

   Analysts believe [48]Apple may sell more iPhones during launch weekend
   this year than in 2012, but not by much.

   Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, expects Apple to sell 5
   million to 6 million iPhones worldwide through Sunday, according to an
   investor note obtained by Mashable. Munster expects that Apple will
   sell about 2.5 million iPhone 5S devices and about 3 million iPhone 5C
   devices, with pre-orders accounting for 1 million of the latter.

   "We believe that Apple will likely sell all of the 5Ses they will
   produce for launch weekend," Munster wrote in the note. "Based on Apple
   not taking online pre-orders for the 5S, which we believe was to avoid
   customers immediately seeing delivery times for 2+ weeks out, we
   believe the 5S is more production-constrained than the iPhone 5 was at
   launch, likely due to the addition of the finger print technology."

   Other analysts were a little more bullish on their sales estimates.
   BTIG Research, which has expressed skepticism about Apple in the past,
   estimates that Apple will sell [50]"at least" 6 million iPhones over
   the weekend thanks to China being included among the countries which
   will get the product right away. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with KGI
   Securities who has an excellent record tracking Apple's product
   pipeline, [51]predicts that the company will sell 6 million to 8
   million new iPhones this weekend.

   By comparison, Apple said it sold 5 million iPhones during launch
   weekend last year, which [52]came in below analysts estimates for
   upwards of 10 million iPhones. That disappointment kickstarted a long
   and painful decline in Apple's stock, driven in part by concerns about
   supply constraints on the new devices. Analysts appear to be more
   cautious in their estimates this time around.

   This year, multiple reports have suggested that the iPhone 5s, the
   higher-end device, will be severely constrained, which may explain why
   Apple has only made the lower-cost iPhone 5c available for pre-order
   and focused its initial marketing around the latter product.

   Are you planning to purchase one of the new iPhone models this weekend?
