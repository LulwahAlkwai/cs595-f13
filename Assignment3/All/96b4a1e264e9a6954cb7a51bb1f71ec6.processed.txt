The chart Tim Cook doesn't want you to see

   By [101]David Yanofsky -- September 10, 2013

   At Apple's iPhone presentation today, Tim Cook [102]presented the
   following chart:

   iphone-sales

   At best the chart is misleading; at worst it's disingenuous. The chart
   has no scale. It could be showing billions of iPhone sales or it could
   be showing hundreds of iPhone sales.

   Furthermore, showing sales cumulatively tacitly overstates the number
   of iPhone users, since some iPhone purchases are replacing older or
   broken iPhones.  Many of the phones Apple is claiming as praiseworthy
   in this chart found the junkyard years ago.

   Using data from Apple's own quarterly reports filed with the Securities
   and Exchange Commission, I made a better chart:

   LB_7986_adjusted_bw

   The overlay shows that, although Apple can boast more than 400 million
   iPhones sold for all time, its quarterly sales of the product have
   declined over the last three quarters.

   Also worth noting is that the chart shown gives a preview of Apple's
   sales ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings release on October 21.
   Judging by the change in slope on its chart, quarterly sales of iPhones
   continued to decline.

Read this next: [103]How the iPhone 5C could turn around Apple's declining
growth
