Pointed talk: Michael Pollan and Amy Harmon dissect a GM controversy

   By [40]Nathanael Johnson

   Last month, the New York Times put its front-page spotlight on a
   [41]lengthy feature by Amy Harmon -- a story that followed an orange
   grower's quest to make the fruit disease-resistant through genetic
   engineering. The piece occasioned plenty of debate. But one tweet from
   Michael Pollan, in particular, triggered a cascade of puzzlement,
   debate, and anger.

   Here's what Pollan said about Harmon's piece:

     Important NYT story on GM oranges; 2 many industry talking pts, but
     poses questions: is prob tech? reg? or Monsanto? [42]nyti.ms/14pVZTY
     --
     Michael Pollan (@michaelpollan) [43]July 28, 2013

   The barrage of angry responses was immediate and sustained, mostly
   focusing on the part about "industry talking points." What did Pollan
   mean by that? Was he simply knocking the story because it showed
   genetic modification in a positive light? Some felt he was calling
   Harmon, a widely admired feature writer who has won two Pulitzers, a
   shill. Many science writers leapt to Harmon's defense.

   As the [44]Columbia Journalism Review reported:

     By exiting the conversation before fully explaining himself, dozens
     of writers argued that Pollan was not only depriving Harmon of a
     chance to respond, but also stunting the conversation surrounding
     genetic modification. "It's a serious charge," explained Carl
     Zimmer, a science writer and Times columnist, who took to Twitter to
     demand that the writer respond. "I don't think it's good enough to
     just say that and leave it."

   I was swept up in the Twitter debate momentarily, and was puzzled by
   the whole thing. I should disclose that Pollan is a friend and a mentor
   -- one who, in my experience, has always been kind and thoughtful. As I
   watched my Twitter stream, I couldn't help wondering what was going on:
   Had Pollan really erred here? And, if not, why the outrage?

   I called Pollan up and asked him some questions. That left me with
   other questions, so afterward [45]I interviewed Harmon as well. In
   retrospect it might have worked better to have the two of them talk
   directly rather than have me play the middleman. But I think there's
   also something to be gained by allowing each to have their say in
   response to my gentle prodding, rather than go at it in full-throttle
   debate: There's already an oversupply of that on this subject.

   michael pollan

   NJ Would you have tweeted the same thing if you knew what the blowback
   would be? And did you mean it as an insult?

   MP No, I didn't mean it as an insult, I thought there were flaws in the
   piece but that -- on balance -- it was a good piece that people needed
   to read. You know, I tweet all sorts of things. Some I agree with, some
   I disagree with, but it's all stuff that I thinks rises to the level
   of, "Hey, I think you should read this and draw your own conclusions."

   In this case for me to tweet it without indicating my reservations
   wouldn't have been accurate. I thought it was an attempt to look at a
   best case of a GM crop -- a potential best case. And that's an
   interesting exercise. I always ask critics of GM, "Can you imagine a GM
   crop that you could get behind?" It used to be, before this debate got
   so ferocious and polarized, that you could get a critic of GM to say,
   "Yeah, if they really worked on improving photosynthetic efficiency, or
   if they made crops that could produce their own nitrogen, I would
   support that." And that made for a very interesting discussion: OK, so
   the problem is not inherent in the technology, it's really in the way
   it's been applied, or the way it's been regulated. So here was one of
   those cases that was really an opportunity for everyone to hit the
   reset button and say, "Could I get behind this?"

   In the rest of my tweet -- and this was addressed to critics, this was
   a challenge to critics of GM -- I asked, is the problem the technology,
   is the problem Monsanto, is the problem regulation? What exactly is
   your problem with it? I think we need to ask those questions, and I ask
   those questions all the time.

   People assume that I'm a dyed-in-the-wool opponent of genetic
   engineering technology. I'm a skeptic, and I'm critical of the way the
   technology has been developed and deployed and what it's done to
   American agriculture, but I don't think the technology itself is
   intrinsically evil. I can imagine applications I would support. This
   was potentially one of those applications. But is it really true that
   there's no other way to deal with this problem? What about getting away
   from monoculture? Is this really the only answer?

   NJ And the other part of that tweet said something about too many
   industry talking points, which is what got people really riled. What
   did you mean by that?

   MP A talking point is not a lie. A talking point is not necessarily
   propaganda. Often they are facts, deployed in political argument. And
   so for example, one of the talking points in the piece was,
   conventional breeding sometimes produces toxic compounds too. And
   that's something I've been hearing from the industry for a very long
   time -- I think they have an example of some potato.

   NJ The [46]Lenape potato.

   MP Right. I'm sure you can find such an exception, but it's not like
   conventional breeding is routinely producing toxins. It's one of those
   facts that works as a bit of political rhetoric. Which is not to say
   that it's false, though it can be true and also misleading. It's useful
   in normalizing genetic engineering.

   NJ So what exactly are the other talking points you found in the piece?
   Let's go through them.

   MP Sure. There's this one. Genetic engineering is on a continuum with
   selective breeding or hybridization: an age-old human reshaping of
   plant genomes. Whether you believe that or not, this has been what
   Monsanto has led with since 1996. And if you go back to [47]that first
   piece I wrote on the subject they were telling me, this is just like
   fermentation, or selective breeding, or hybridization.

   And you know, that is a point you can argue. Yet it can also be argued
   that, unlike GM, those operations don't involve crossing the species
   boundary. Even breeding with radiation doesn't involve crossing the
   species boundary. Now maybe there's nothing wrong with crossing the
   species boundary -- viruses do it all the time -- but the point is,
   it's a talking point that needs to be approached with some skepticism.

   Here's another: Criticism of the industry explains why we haven't seen
   lots of terrific GM products in the market.

   NJ That one seems suspect to me.

   MP I think that's really dubious. The industry has been blaming critics
   for their failures from the earliest days, I just don't see a lot of
   great stuff being held up. And you might look at [48]Golden Rice to see
   if environmentalists are to blame for the delays, or was it competing
   patent claims and technological problems? But it's very convenient --
   it's a great thing to tell your investors -- if you are having trouble,
   that it's critics that are slowing things down.

   What else? Oh, GM products have received extensive health and safety
   testing, including dozens of long-term feeding trials. I think that's
   questionable. Federal regulation of new GM crops has been rigorous. I
   think that's a point you could argue. Critics of GM, and proponents of
   labeling, are scientifically illiterate and engaged in fearmongering.
   [laughs] Americans won't eat genetically modified foods even if they
   offer real benefits. Again, that proposition hasn't been tested.

   Part of the reason consumers are objecting to GM is that GM hasn't
   offered consumers anything of value. What if they did? I think that if
   they actually saved orange juice for America, people would get behind
   it. I think if they could produce a substantially healthier cooking
   oil, Americans would get behind it. I mean, we're the ones who bought
   Olestra.

   NJ Just look at cellphones -- there are [49]some legitimate questions
   about brain cancer.

   MP You're irradiating your head on a daily basis -- but we're willing
   to do it, if it offers a benefit. Americans are not all that skeptical
   of technology. We  sit for all sorts of things that Europeans don't sit
   for. And we trust our regulators, on balance, in a way that Europeans
   don't (the reason they don't is because of mad cow disease, and a few
   other things). So I think that too is an industry talking point -- that
   if we have labeling nobody is going to buy this stuff. I think it's
   arguable at best. It reflects the industry's failure to offer anything
   of value to consumers, which has created a vacuum into which critics
   -and, yes, some fearmongers -- could step.

   Public discussion of GM is a risk to consumer acceptance of GM
   products. In other words, just by debating labeling we're hurting this
   technology. If the technology can't survive public debate, then it's
   got a serious problem. This is the first time we've had any public
   debate -- you know, it's been on the market for 17 years. If you
   remember the premise of [50]my piece, in 1999, I think it was, I was
   looking at the introduction to this radical change in American
   agriculture -- by Monsanto's admission by the way, it was a radical
   change.

   NJ I remember.

   MP And there was no politics around it at all, while at the same time
   Europe was going crazy. So the premise of that piece was, are they
   crazy or are we crazy? Are they crazy for debating this change or are
   we crazy for not debating it? So in America this debate is fairly new.
   I mean people have been trying to stir it up but not getting much
   attention, certainly not getting 49 percent of the vote in California.

   And then the last one: People should support the GM products we have
   today because of the much better GM promised for the future. You know,
   farmers have a term for this: Buying a pig in a poke.

   NJ Just to circle back to the issue of health and safety testing: there
   have been quite a few long-term feeding trials, and -- sure -- you can
   go through and pick them apart. But it was fairly convincing to me to
   see how many big groups of scientists, where they get all these
   disciplines together, have come to the same conclusions. The Swiss just
   finished this, for instance -- and one after another they've come
   through and said, you know, we really don't think that this is
   something that, on balance, we have to worry much about. What do you
   think about that?

   MP Well, I don't know what to think about it, because I haven't looked
   at it as closely as you have, and I haven't read the studies or these
   institutional sign-offs. But I do wonder how much industry lobbying has
   gone on with these groups and how much independent science has been
   done. Very little of it gets done: It was hard to do it until you could
   get access to the seeds, and there was a huge penalty for doing it --
   people who tried came under attack.

   So you may well be right, I just don't know enough to say. And it's
   worth noting that American regulators do not demand any feedings
   studies -- what's been done has been at the behest of European
   regulators. Right, the FDA asks for tests on allergenicity -- by and
   large isn't that the deal with safety testing in this country?

   NJ Yeah, they test for a few other things, but feeding trials don't
   happen, or at least are very rare. And it's all done by the companies
   themselves, with oversight.

   MP Which is of course true with drug tests. But people assume the FDA
   has done a lot of feeding trials, and what I learned in reporting this
   is that, no, they don't. It's mostly in vitro allergenicity -- which is
   important, because that's where they've found problems in the past.

   I don't know the answer. I'm not yet convinced that you can say there's
   extensive, independent health and safety testing. It may well be -- but
   the point is that this is what the industry has been saying since the
   beginning, when it certainly wasn't the case.

   And again: All journalism contains talking points. I have published
   talking points. I didn't quite see it as the venal sin of journalism
   that some of the tweeters did, and I think there was a thin-skinnedness
   among some of my science-writing brethren about pointing it out.
   Political writers jostle and elbow each other all the time and it's not
   that big a deal. But we science writers are supposed to be so
   enlightened, so rational that we are above all that -- somehow
   post-political.

   NJ Because we're always right. [laughs] Being wrong as a science writer
   -- or not even being wrong, but being criticized implies wrongness
   -that's the worst thing that can happen.

   MP That's right. But, you see, the criticism is about journalism and
   not science.

   NJ What is that criticism? I think Amy Harmon said, and is probably
   right, that this was supposed to be a narrative piece and it was about
   oranges. There's no way to contain every point of the GM debate.

   MP And I don't know that you need to contain every point. But I would
   just say that when you are building a big, long-form narrative on a big
   subject around a microcosm, the question of just how representative
   your microcosm is of the general case becomes important.

   I love that kind of journalism, it's precisely the kind of journalism I
   did with my piece about a GM potato, so I've played in the same
   sandbox. But the question is, is it representative of other GM products
   and crops? And if it's not, could you just discuss for a little while
   what's anomalous about it? So, for example, point out that disease
   resistance is something that's not a high priority for this industry --
   wouldn't it be great if it were?

   Just kind of putting your microcosm in context, that's all. When you
   don't do that -- and your story stands as a metaphor for all of GM, and
   is perhaps the New York Times` only cover on the topic this year -- you
   have to ask, it a fair metaphor for all of GM? Is it a fair metaphor
   for what we might call -- after the old socialist line-"actually
   existing GM" [laughs].

   There was actually existing socialism, which was horrible, and then
   there was the Marxist ideal, which the socialists were always tried to
   rescue from the taint of the real thing. Well, we have actually
   existing GM and we have a wonderful scientific ideal. And I think being
   sensitive to the tensions between those two things would have served
   the reader, though I would lay this criticism more on the editors than
   the writer.

   But I have to stress, on balance, I'm happy the Times published that
   piece. And it really dropped a challenge at the feet of critics of GM
   to figure out, well, what is your problem? And my problem is not
   necessarily the same as their problem. My problem has been less about
   health and safety of the technology than it has been about the
   political economy of GM and what it has done to American agriculture,
   to competition in the seed business, and to the size and sustainability
   of our commodity crop monocultures.

   But you know, this is a tweet -- this isn't a book review! It's just,
   "Read this but be sensitive to this." Maybe what I should have done is
   listed my nine talking points in nine tweets.

   NJ Maybe so. And also, I think you may have violated the unspoken
   conventions of Twitter in that you aren't on there all the time. I
   think people kind of expect people who are on Twitter to be constantly
   responding and debating there.

   MP Carl Zimmer wrote me and said Twitter is a social medium and you
   have an obligation to respond. I actually don't accept that. There are
   different ways to use Twitter. I essentially use it as a broadcast
   medium rather than a social medium.

   NJ You don't respond at all.

   MP Very seldom. I use it as a clipping service for my readers: Here's
   something interesting that crossed my desk. And a lot of journalists
   use it that way. I don't necessarily feel it's a good place to conduct
   debates. I think it's a very good place to exchange readings. And get
   each other up to speed. I end up reading things I don't agree with
   because I'm on Twitter, and I'm sure that happens with my feed -- I
   mean, not everyone following me, obviously, agrees with me. There's not
   one way to use Twitter. And then there's the fact that I was on
   vacation and I was going 24 hours without opening my laptop and uh, you
   know, paid a price. [laughs]

   NJ You certainly were, what's the word? Chastised? [laughs] Punished?

   MP Punishment's a strong word for a handful of nasty tweets. You know
   how this started, actually? I opened my Twitter feed on that Sunday
   night, I guess it was, and there was this tweet from someone saying,
   it's been 24 hours and Michael Pollan hasn't commented on Amy Harmon's
   piece. And I fell right into that trap [laughs]. I didn't know about
   the piece. So I read it and I said, this is interesting, I'm going to
   tell my readers about it.

   And so there was -- the shitstorm, as they say. Though I wasn't
   following it minute by minute. And I did seriously consider responding,
   because I did feel bad I hadn't spelled out the talking points. But
   then I finally decided, is this the right arena in which to have the
   discussion? And I did write extensive emails explaining my point of
   view to anyone who reached out to me, including Carl Zimmer, and he can
   tell you that. I was happy to engage, and if Amy Harmon had written to
   me I would have been happy to engage.

   But, Jesus! This was a "Hey, read this piece" with a caveat. And I
   think it's a measure of just how ugly this debate has gotten that that
   is considered, you know, a low blow, an insult, tantamount to calling
   someone a shill. It's definitely not tantamount to calling someone a
   shill -- I never would have done that with that piece, because it isn't
   true. That's not what I was saying, and I think that reflects a
   misunderstanding of what an industry talking point is.

   It's really sad how this debate is getting played out. You're on one
   side or the other. I actually think my position on GM is somewhat
   nuanced. Being skeptical about science and technology is very much in
   the scientific spirit, and if everybody in the scientific community is
   on one side, it doesn't necessarily mean we shouldn't remain skeptical,
   not necessarily of the scientific consensus -- though we can argue
   about that -- but then certainly of the real-world impacts of the
   technology, which are political, economic, agronomic, and intellectual
   property issues.

   It's a very clever meme to liken doubt about GM to doubt about climate
   change, but it's misleading. You can accept that GM is safe -- the
   narrow scientific issue -without accepting that it's a good idea for
   the American food system, or has contributed much of value. Surely it
   would be a shame if climate-change skeptics gave skepticism a bad rap!

   The other thing is recognizing that we never escape politics and we
   never escape economics, even when we are talking about science and
   technology. Even for science writers who have satisfied themselves on
   the health and safety of GM, there are other issues -- much messier
   issues -- that they need to pay attention to.
     __________________________________________________________________

   After speaking with Michael Pollan, I asked Amy Harmon if I could get
   her side of the story.
   Amy Harmon Scott Matthews

   NJ The big Twitter kerfuffle basically came down to, what did Pollan
   mean by "talking points"? He says, you know, a talking point isn't
   something that's untrue -- it's more like a meme, a fact that one group
   decides to seed into the conversation as often as possible. Like Romney
   saying we have a trillion dollar deficit -- it was true, but repeating
   it without [51]unpacking it serves his interests. And, by the way, I've
   repeated many of the same talking points that came up in your story,
   and [laughs] a lot of astute Grist readers made damn sure to let me
   know. So, knowing that's what Pollan meant by talking points, does that
   change the way you interpret that tweet at all?

   AH Um, no. If someone said to a political reporter, "You included too
   many of the campaign talking points," that political reporter would be
   insulted, because she would know that meant that she was taking the
   campaign's propaganda unquestioningly and repeating it. So it was meant
   as a diss -- I don't see how it could be interpreted as anything other
   than that.

   NJ He says it wasn't a diss, he didn't mean to make it personal, just
   to include a caveat about the story.

   AH Well, OK, if you don't want to call it a diss you could call it a
   caveat. Most every other reporter who read it thought it was a diss,
   though.

   NJ [laughs] Well, I didn't think that was a diss. It doesn't mean that
   the industry pulled the wool over your eyes. I mean, what gave the
   story its rhetorical drive -- aside from the narrative drive, which was
   masterful -- was the challenge to people like me who do have some real
   concerns about GMOs. To say, look, here's a case that's pretty hard to
   oppose. Could you accept this type of GMO, and if not, why not? And by
   virtue of doing that, you kind of need to repeat all these points.

   AH Hm, well -- I appreciate your saying that about the rhetorical and
   narrative drives. What made this story challenging to me was precisely
   that -- I was trying to embed an argument, and a lot of explanatory
   information, in a classic kind of quest-story, with suspense and a
   narrative arc and all that. But I don't think that gives me a pass to
   parrot points from either side without doing a lot of reporting and
   making sure I understand which ones are fair, and why -- which is what
   I did.

   NJ I don't think you are parroting talking points, but they are in
   there, fair or not, as they are in my work. But since you mention
   narrative, that's a point that has come up -- that maybe story telling
   is a fundamentally biased form of communication.

   AH The [52]CJR reporter, Alexis Fitts, raised an interesting question
   in her piece on this episode. Basically, "Is it inherently manipulative
   to tell a narrative story from the point of view of a single character
   to viscerally draw people into a debate over a broader subject?" And to
   some degree it is.

   Like you said, I was trying to tell a story that challenged people's
   preconceptions of genetically modified food. And I was trying to make
   an argument through narrative, in part to make it less boring. I did
   want to raise the important points in the debate, but I was trying not
   to make them by saying, "Here's what opponents say and what proponents
   say."

   NJ That's a different form and it doesn't lend itself to narrative.

   AH A narrative can achieve the same thing as an overtly explanatory or
   essayistic piece of writing, I think -- it's just a different strategy.
   I personally like that form, I think it's underused in science writing.
   But precisely because you are engaging people's emotions with this kind
   of storytelling, and using characters and scenes and dialogue to get
   points across, I think it's your responsibility as a reporter to be
   sure you're reflecting some greater truth that you've verified with
   outside experts. That's what makes it not manipulative -- and
   potentially more powerful.

   Michael is obviously a great narrative reporter, but his type of
   narratives are pretty different than mine. I tend to do what's called
   "immersion narrative" -- you know, in the world [laughs] of
   narrative-writing people -- or "story narrative," where there is a main
   character with a conflict and some form of resolution at the end. And
   this is a tricky topic for that.

   For example I wrote about this young man with autism who was trying to
   achieve independence. And there was an argument behind that, choosing
   him and choosing that subject. Basically, "Hey, readers, these people
   with neurological differences are coming of age, and with accommodation
   and with the type of programs I chose to highlight they could stand a
   much better chance of being integrated into society." But that was a
   less controversial argument, probably, at least for New York Times
   readers. Because [genetically modified food] is an issue where many
   people hold the opposite view, it may have seemed more "inherently
   manipulative" to some readers.

   NJ I asked Michael what he would have wanted to see different in the
   piece. And he said, I would like to see a sentence or two placing this
   in context: Is this representative of the sort of problems we are
   solving with GM? What percentage of GMOs have to do with disease
   resistance? This story was about GM giving us more foods, and, except
   with papaya, that hasn't been the case: Most GM has really been about
   farming more efficiently. Should you have placed this in context a bit
   more?
   Not amused: A friend took a picture of Harmon right after she read
   Pollan's tweet. Philip CohenNot amused: A friend took a picture of
   Harmon right after she read Pollan's tweet.

   AH Let me read you a line in the story, from a [section] called "The
   Monsanto Effect":

     It had not helped win hearts and minds for G.M.O.'s, Mr. Kress knew,
     that the first such crop widely adopted by farmers was the soybean
     engineered by Monsanto with a bacteria gene -- to tolerate a weed
     killer Monsanto also made.

   So that's where I'm trying to nod to the fact that that not all GMOs
   are about saving the orange crop, and that the motivation behind one of
   the first ones was that it could help sell this chemical for Monsanto.
   The point is that that their association with chemical companies is why
   many people became opposed to GMOs in the beginning and are opposed to
   them now. And then it goes on:

     Starting in the mid-1990s, soybean farmers in the United States
     overwhelmingly adopted that variety of the crop, which made it
     easier for them to control weeds. But the subsequent broader use of
     the chemical -- along with a distaste for Monsanto's aggressive
     business tactics and a growing suspicion of a food system driven by
     corporate profits ...

   I mean, I think that is just the context Michael is saying is not
   there. It's not there in a strictly explanatory style. It's folded it
   into the narrative, and discussed as it relates to Kress [the main
   character of the story] and what his scientists are objecting to at the
   time. But I wanted to make sure that was in there, it was a priority.
   Because, the story was about Kress needing to face the public
   opposition to GMOs, so it would have been absurd not to explain why
   that opposition exists.

   NJ And probably the reason I didn't immediately think of those lines is
   because it is woven in, rather than doing a full stop: "OK, here's how
   this story is situated."

   AH I wish that section could have been longer -- in some of my many
   drafts, it was a lot longer. But then it also included what GM
   proponents say about herbicide-resistant crops -- that even if they've
   helped sales of Monsanto's flagship chemical, they have had a net
   environmental benefit by reducing the use of more toxic herbicides, and
   the carbon emissions associated with tilling.

   NJ I don't know that we need to hash out every one of these talking
   points that Pollan brought up. We certainly can. I know you've seen
   them. Are there any that you wanted to address?

   AH There was one in the [53]CJR piece, where he said, "She should have
   talked to more levelheaded critics because all the critics she talked
   to sounded crazy." But I feel like the head of the [54]Environmental
   Working Group, a major environmental organization, who I quote, is a
   legitimate spokesperson for anti-GM criticism. I also talked to
   Margaret Mellon at the [55]Union of Concerned Scientists, who I'm sure
   you've talked to. I didn't quote her directly but she helped me
   formulate some of the passages that explain why people worry about
   GMOs, like the one about why they are potentially more dangerous than
   previous forms of breeding.

   NJ One of Pollan's talking points was that critics of GM are
   scientifically illiterate and just fearmongers, and it sounds like you
   are saying, that's not the impression that readers of your story would
   be left with.

   AH Right, I don't think so. I linked to the press release -- from the
   national organization, Just Label It -- that the Environmental Working
   Group quote Michael said was not level-headed comes from, in which the
   president of the organization, Ken Cook, is connecting the need for
   labels on GMOs to other scary things:

     Arguing that the Food and Drug Administration should require labels
     on food containing GMOs, one leader of the Environmental Working
     Group, an advocacy group, cited "pink slime, deadly melons, tainted
     turkeys and [56]BPA in our soup."

   I can't imagine that Michael would say Ken Cook is not a reasonable
   person. And those are the tactics that they are using to get people to
   support labeling. It's not my fault. That's what they are doing. So I
   think it's fair to have that represented in my story.

   NJ There's one point that I wanted to go over with you because I wonder
   how true it is. And you got into this a little bit with your [57]Golden
   Rice piece. But Michael brought this up as a talking point, the idea
   that criticism or vandalism by activists explains why we don't have
   great GM innovations. Did you find good evidence of that?

   AH First of all, I'd like to know where he saw that in my story. There
   was a line that attributed that sentiment to some of the scientists
   that Kress was employing:

     Some of Mr. Kress's scientists were still fuming about what they saw
     as the lost potential for social good hijacked both by the activists
     who opposed genetic engineering and the corporations that failed to
     convince consumers of its benefits. In many developing countries,
     concerns about safety and ownership of seeds led governments to
     delay or prohibit cultivation of needed crops: Zambia, for instance,
     declined shipments of G.M.O. corn even during a 2002 famine.

   I mean, that is just a fact. I'm not saying that Greenpeace or other
   activists trumped up this concern. I just said concerns about the
   safety and ownership of GMO foods made governments choose what they
   chose.

   NJ I'm sure that's what he's referring to. Michael wasn't saying that
   you personally accept these points, just that they appear in the piece.

   AH I see how you're parsing it, and I should say I really appreciate
   Michael's drawing people's attention to the story, which he did call
   "interesting." But if he really felt that these points just represented
   different, legitimate points of view of the type that get aired in most
   any piece of journalism, then why would he say it contained too many
   and call them talking points?

   NJ Well let me just ask you, because I'm curious if you've figured this
   out. Have you found environmental activists really at fault for
   delaying wonderful GM technologies?

   AH Yeah, I have spent some time trying to track this down. Because that
   is -- whether it's a talking point or not -- a claim you hear from
   proponents of genetically modified food. And it's a claim I have heard
   a lot from scientists who work on it -- they have this perception that,
   for instance, they couldn't get funding because no one would invest in
   this unless they could be sure the public would accept it, and the
   public wouldn't accept it because these activists are scaring them.

   Golden Rice, [58]which I wrote about last weekend, is one of the
   classic cases where you hear that. It's designed to produce
   beta-carotene, the source of vitamin A, whose deficiency contributes to
   the death of millions of people in Asia and Africa each year, and it
   has been a lightning rod for criticism by activists who see it as a
   cynical attempt to get people to buy into genetic engineering. Some
   people say that kind of criticism has dissuaded governments from
   allowing the field trials necessary to test it. But my sense is that
   Golden Rice has been delayed mostly because they were getting the
   science right. And they were doing the testing right. They had trials
   to do, they had to improve the bioavailability of the beta carotene in
   it to make it a reasonable source of Vitamin A.

   NJ Aside from dissecting every word that you've written, why do you
   think there was such a strong reaction to Michael's tweet, both from
   yourself -- you seemed to be pretty upset about it -- and the rest of
   the Twitterverse? Call it a diss or call it a caveat, I think it is a
   critique, but it seems to be a pretty mild critique.

   AH For me, I was insulted because I really feel like he was challenging
   my journalistic integrity. I spent a year on the story, I worked
   weekends and evenings on the story. So you know ...

   NJ I can understand the disappointment.

   AH He was saying I hadn't done my homework, and I really had done my
   homework, so I was, you know, mad. And there was a level on which it
   was pretty patronizing to assume that I hadn't. I think he knows my
   previous work, I think he could have been more charitable in his
   assumptions about my ability to not parrot talking points.

   But in terms of the broader reaction, I think it's a testament to
   Michael's stature as a journalist and as a critic of industrial
   agriculture. So when he says something, people believe him. He has, you
   know, several hundred thousand Twitter followers. So there was a sense
   among other journalists that communicated with me, that he was trying
   to undermine work that they believed in. I guess I shouldn't be the one
   to say what other people thought, you could ask them.

   NJ Sure, but one thing that concerns me about this whole debate is that
   there is this kind of -- well, I think you said the word -- "belief."
   And journalists, especially science journalists, are really rallying
   around this issue. While you can certainly see my work at Grist has
   been trying to find some clarity and dismiss old myths, there certainly
   are legitimate questions in this area that require open-minded
   reporting. And there are value judgments in this debate. Maybe it was
   just because Michael was my professor, but I felt like there was a kind
   of knee-jerk response to his tweet.

   AH I actually think you would be wrong to attribute that to ideology on
   the part of science reporters. I think it comes down to a feeling that
   Michael, as great a reporter as he is on food issues, he has not really
   dug into the science of genetic engineering, especially the health and
   safety issues. As a result he seems to let stand a lot of the beliefs
   that fly in the face of what is really a broad scientific consensus
   that there is nothing intrinsically dangerous about moving DNA from one
   organism to another.

   The World Health Organization says each crop has to be evaluated on its
   own merits and tested, but these tests are reliable. I've been sending
   everyone who asks me the link to your post on the safety issues, which
   you investigated in a particularly compelling way, I thought, and came
   to that same conclusion. So I don't really think it's fair to say it's
   about values.

   I will say, other than personal pique, I had one higher-minded reason
   why I take some offense at the general position he has taken publicly
   about the subject. I really think he has an important critique, that
   these big companies are controlling the food system and that's a cause
   for concern and, you know, I agree with that. But I don't think you can
   figure out how to fix that problem if you haven't identified its real
   source. And I think the idea that GMOs are scary -- because they
   involve moving around genes and messing with the natural order of
   things -- is an easy way to get people up in arms about a problem that
   is both misleading about the technology and also not the true source of
   the problem. So I think he does a disservice to his larger critique.

   NJ Anything else you want to talk about here?

   AH Well, we can quibble about these points of journalism, but I'm
   curious to know what Michael's response to the story's overarching
   question really is. Tom Philpott at Mother Jones, another outspoken
   critic of genetic engineering, had quibbles himself with my story, but
   he actually came out and said I think saving the Florida orange crop
   from an otherwise incurable disease is a good use of genetic
   engineering. I'm curious to know if Michael thinks this is a good use
   of it or not, and the same in the case of Golden Rice.

   NJ Well, maybe it's time for him to write another GMO piece.
