   Why the Next CEO At Microsoft Should Be A Woman. Somewhat disagree,
   Ballmer didn't fail because he had a penis
   It goes to the core of why Microsoft isn't as successful as they should
   be. I don't see the problem as one connected to whether Steve Ballmer
   had a penis or not. You can argue it wasn't really a vision problem
   either, as Bill's Vision was pretty accurate and good for at least a
   decade. It was an execution problem and to fix that it likely will
   require someone who has both the knowledge of why tools like Forced
   Ranking don't work and understand how to get a dysfunctional company to
   function. In effect I don't believe a new CEO alone, male or female, is
   going to fix the firm. It needs a team of people that trust each other
   with both the collective knowledge of what needs to be done and the
   authority to do it. Just tossing in a female CEO alone will likely be
   another Carly Fiorina event that won't reflect well on female CEOs even
   though the failure wouldn't have anything to do with having a penis
   either. However the Huffington Post makes an interesting argument:
