   [3]Marginal Revolution

Is the labor market return to higher education finally falling?

   by [4]Tyler Cowen on June 27, 2013 at 2:04 am in [5]Economics,
   [6]Education | [7]Permalink

   Peter Orszag considers that possibility in [8]his recent column.  About
   one in four bartenders has some kind of degree.  Orszag draws heavily
   on [9]this paper by Beaudry and Green and Sand, which  postulates
   falling returns to skill.  It's one of the more interesting pieces
   written in the last year, but note their model relies heavily on a
   stock/flow distinction.  They consider a world where most of the IT
   infrastructure already has been built, and so skilled labor has not so
   much more to do at the margin.  This stands in noted contrast to the
   common belief -- [10]which I share -- that "IT-souped up smart
   machines" still have a long way to go and are not a mature technology.
   You can't hold that view and also buy into the Beaudry and Green and
   Sand story, unless you think we have suddenly jumped to a new margin
   where machines build machines, with little help from humans.

   Rather than accepting "falling returns to skill," I would sooner say
   that education doesn't measure true skill as well as it used to.

   The more likely scenario is that the variance of the return to having a
   college education has gone up, and indeed that is what you would expect
   from a world of rising income inequality.  Many people get the degree,
   yet without learning the skills they need for the modern workplace.  In
   other words, the world of work is changing faster than the world of
   what we teach (surprise, surprise).  The lesser trained students end up
   driving cabs, if they can work a GPS that is.  The lack of skill of
   those students also raises wage returns for those individuals who a)
   have the degree, b) are self-taught about the modern workplace, and c)
   show the personality skills that employers now know to look for.  All
   of a sudden those individuals face less competition and so their wages
   rise.  The high returns stem from blending formal education with their
   intangibles (there is also more pressure to get an advanced degree to
   show you are one of the privileged, but that is another story.)

   This polarization of returns -- among degree holders -- explains both
   why incomes are rising at the top end, and why [11]the rate of dropping
   out of college is rising too.  At some point along the way in the
   college experience, lots of students realize they won't be able to
   "cross the divide," and the degree alone won't do it for them.  They
   foresee their future tending bar and act accordingly.

   Too many discussions of the returns to education focus on the mean or
   median and neglect the variance and what is likely a recent increase in
   that variance.

          Tending bar is a tough job, but somebody has to do it.

          If the bartender with a degree is happier than he would be
          without a degree, then it was worth it. This article seems to
          suggest that students only study to get a job. Many of us study
          to avoid getting a job too early, though, and we enjoy the
          experience. It also ain't bad to be the smartest guy at the bar,
          with a degree in Egyptology and literature.

                "Many of us study to avoid getting a job too early"

                On the one hand obviously I would like to hear the
                explanation of what it means to get a job "too early", on
                the other hand I have the feeling that I would end up
                punching a wall if I heard that explanation.

                      Because jobs are not fun, and college is?

                      Some people value fun more than money. If that
                      revelation makes you want to punch a wall, sucks to
                      be you.

                            College is very expensive fun. It may be
                            better to travel the world tending bar at that
                            price, but hey, its all about preferences.

                          Urso June 27, 2013 at 11:52 am
                                  Fair enough, but these arguments about
                                  whether college is "worth it" always
                                  seem to operative from the base
                                  assumption that (1) college is
                                  universally some extremely expensive
                                  endeavor, and (2) everyone ends up with
                                  a useless degree in something like
                                  Egyptology. But it's not, and they
                                  don't. Most people attend public
                                  universities. Most people do not
                                  graduate with degrees in the liberal
                                  arts.

                                  And for what it's worth, tending bar in
                                  a foreign country sounds awful to me. As
                                  you say, it's all about preferences.

     If the bartender with a degree is happier than he would be without a
     degree, then it was worth it.

                For him, sure. But it certainly weakens the case for
                public support of his classroom education. After all,
                while it is good that he is happier, why should the things
                that make him happy be subsidized more than things that
                make other people who enjoy more experiential education
                happy?

              Andrew' June 27, 2013 at 7:31 am
                      Except he's not. And it's a stupid idea. And one you
                      never hear anywhere else.

                    Andrew' June 27, 2013 at 7:32 am
                            "If the patient is happier with the
                            superfluous diagnostics...then they are worth
                            it."

                            See, it doesn't work.

                                  I'm pretty sure that people make that
                                  argument for privately supported
                                  activities all the time.

                    John Thacker June 27, 2013 at 8:19 am
                            I apologize, but I'm not sure what your "he's
                            not" is referring to. I'm fairly certain that
                            university education is subsidized in a lot of
                            ways relative to other sorts of spending.

                          Andrew' June 27, 2013 at 9:37 am
                                  First, I wasn't disagreeing with your
                                  comment, I was disagreeing with the
                                  supposition that "if it feels good, do
                                  it" is a complete economics argument.

                                  As in He's not really happier. He might
                                  be proud of the endowment effect for his
                                  degree in a society that irrationally
                                  supports degrees. And if he is happier,
                                  it may only be because we have a regime
                                  of overspending on the education
                                  charade. He might not be happier if he
                                  personally did not get his useless
                                  degree. But he would almost certainly be
                                  happier if we did away with the useless
                                  degree raj.

                          John Thacker June 27, 2013 at 10:04 am
                                  Ah, thank you for the explanation, I
                                  believe I understand better now.

                                  I think it's tricky to disagree with
                                  people about whether or not they are
                                  happier. (It's tricky to measure it and
                                  to believe as well, certainly.) So I
                                  think it's perfectly fine to let people
                                  "overspend" on things that don't
                                  objectively help them, and I think it
                                  happens all the time. However, as I
                                  think you agree, the effect on public
                                  spending is different.

                There is nothing wrong with working "happiness" into your
                ROI, but costs still matter. Lower costs still produce
                better ROI.

              Andrew' June 27, 2013 at 9:39 am
                      Right, "working in" is not the same as "is so
                      important that we need to take YOUR money because it
                      makes this bartender happy to have a psychology
                      degree (not to mention it helps with the ladies!)"

   Ed June 27, 2013 at 2:56 am
          This appears to be overthinking the issue, thouogh people will
          yell "lump of labor" if you get close to what is really going
          on.

          Basically, the university system emerged to train professionals
          (originally mostly clergy). If its function -"colleges" plus
          graduate school is still mainly to train professionals, for
          several decades they have been turning out more degree holders
          than the professions can absorb. But the cost to students has
          been rising sharply, for a diminsihing chance of making a
          success in the professions.

          An alternative explanation is that in the United States,
          secondary institutions shouldn't be grouped with graduate
          schools, but instead with high schools. A college degree is
          really the equivalent of what the high school diploma had been
          fifty years ago. But then this is a sneaky way to charge people
          for what the public school system used to provide "for free"!
          And of course if you charge quite a bit for something that had
          been free at the point of service, then the returns of that
          thing will have diminshed.

          Incidentally, if you view the college degree as it stands now as
          a sort of license to enter the labor market, then the rising
          cost of college could be one explanation for the falling labor
          force participation rate.

          It's not just the variance, it's the risk. I.e. a predictable
          spread would have less impact than a capricious spread. Also,
          the risk of debt is now (perceived to be?) higher, so that
          increases the impact of the risk.

          I think there's a structural piece to it as well - universities
          aren't responding fast enough to the absolutely massive impact
          the social web is having on recruitment. Like the old media, on
          the slide to oblivion, unless they can re-invent themselves
          ground up. It's not education that doesn't have a value, it's
          the overall package linking income with outputs that now doesn't
          sit right with the market.

          The base challenge for any educator: demonstrate that the skills
          an educatee gains are (a) meaningful in the market and (b)
          gained as a consequence of their learning. If they can do that,
          then they have enduring value.

          "Where did the Productivity Growth Go? Inflation Dynamics and
          the Distribution of Income", by Ian Dew-Becker and Robert J.
          Gordon, September 8-9, 2005

          [14]http://zfacts.com/metaPage/lib/gordon-Dew-Becker.pdf

          "We argue that economists in their explanations of growing
          income inequality have placed too much emphasis on "skill-biased
          technical change" and too little attention to the "economics of
          superstars," i.e., the pure rents earned by the top CEOs, sports
          starts, and entertainment stars. This source of divergence at
          the top, combined with the role of deunionization, immigration,
          and free trade in pushing down incomes at the bottom, have led
          to the wide divergence between the growth rates of productivity,
          average compensation, and median compensation."

          "To be convincing, a theory must fit the facts, and the basic
          facts to be explained about income equality are not one but two,
          that is, not only why inequality rose after the mid-1970s but
          why it declined from 1929 to the mid-1970s. Three events fit
          neatly into this U-shaped pattern, all of which influence the
          effective labor supply curve and the bargaining power of labor:
          (1) the rise and fall of unionization, (2) the decline and
          recovery of immigration, and (3) the decline and recovery in the
          importance of international trade and the share of imports....
          Partly as a result of restrictive legislation in the 1920s, and
          also the Great Depression and World War II, the share of
          immigration per year in the total population declined from 1.3
          percent in 1914 to 0.02 percent in 1933, remained very low until
          a gradual recovery began in the late 1960s, reaching 0.48
          percent (legal and illegal) in 2002. Competition for unskilled
          labor not only arrives in the form of immigration but also in
          the form of imports, and the decline of the import share from
          the 1920s to the 1950s and its subsequent recovery is a basic
          fact of the national accounts."

        John Thacker June 27, 2013 at 5:49 am
                Hmm, but what are the policy recommendations from this?
                Surely not "let's have another Great Depression and World
                War II to decrease inequality," one hopes. And personally
                even if immigration increases national inequality, it
                certainly seems to decrease global inequality, and I place
                value on that.

          What are these "personality skills that employers now know to
          look for"? How are they different from personality skills that
          employers looked for 20 years ago? How did employers learn to
          look for them?

          If you have 2 types of degrees: (1) tangibly valuable ones and
          (2) not-tangibly valuable ones and the ratio (1)/(2) shifts, you
          get this result.

          Haven't repeated posts here discussed how the growth in college
          degrees have mostly come from soft degrees?

        Joss Delage June 27, 2013 at 9:24 am
                I agree with Luis. I think those discussions are useless
                without a look at majors. Without this, we're comparing
                apples to oranges.

        JWatts June 27, 2013 at 9:47 am
                If you have 2 types of degrees: (1) tangibly valuable ones
                and (2) not-tangibly valuable ones and the ratio (1)/(2)
                shifts, you get this result.

                Nice sentence!

                However, you don't even need a shift in the ratio between
                (1) & (2) to get this result. Even, if the ratio is
                constant, but the degree'd population is rising (more high
                school graduates going to college) and the demand for (2)
                is not rising as fast as the the degree'd population is,
                then you get a surplus of (2).

                The surplus drives the wages for (2) down, which should
                theoretically reduce the supply in the long run except the
                type of student who would pursue not-tangibly valuable
                degrees are less price sensitive than the general
                population.

                Therefore, we end up with a lot of bartenders with degrees
                in Egyptology and literature. And the world has never had
                much demand for Egyptologists, nor is that likely to
                change.

        [16]Marisa Gunther June 28, 2013 at 6:07 pm
                Totally agree with you.

   uffy June 27, 2013 at 4:02 am
          Who, exactly, "face less competition and so their wages rise" in
          this scenario and why? Would not this explanation involve a
          somehow diminished lump of those with "true skill"?

          At least we are having this conversation though.

   Rahul June 27, 2013 at 4:12 am
          Bartenders and taxi-drivers are a biased sample though. These
          have traditionally been the refuge of intelligent, often
          highly-educated people who somehow did not want to pursue
          traditional routes.

          Lack of skill is the wrong explanation here; it has to do with
          other reasons often: A disillusionment with systems, rebellion,
          idealism, desire to stay with a gf / bf, strong geographical
          preferences, ennui, boredom, flagging of motivation etc.

                Lack of skill is the wrong explanation here; it has to do
                with other reasons

                I think a lot of the problem is the signaling mechanism
                was inefficient for a generation or two. I think the Baby
                Boomer's parents told them to get a college degree and
                you'll do fine, and simultaneously the access to college
                degree was rapidly rising. And the advice was good.

                However, the Baby Boomer's gave their children the same
                advice. However, by that time, the ability of the market
                to absorb college degrees was saturating and so the the
                price point for entry level positions started slipping and
                the demand for the jobs became greater. So many of the Gen
                X'rs who took the advice and got degrees, but didn't think
                it mattered what the major was in and so obtained
                intellectually interesting or fun degrees without any
                intrinsic value.

                The weird aspect is that this has been recognized as a
                problem (too many useless college degrees) for at least a
                decade and all kind of solutions have been discussed, but
                nothing has been done. Why hasn't the public school system
                started ramping up the number of trade school positions?
                Why aren't more parents telling their children that
                getting a well paid job as a plumber is a better way to
                raise a family than following your desires, because after
                all your only young once.

                I'm believe the advice to young people to follow their
                hearts desire while they are young is ultimately self
                destructive and irrational.

          Tyler said: "The more likely scenario is that the variance of
          the return to having a college education has gone up, and indeed
          that is what you would expect from a world of rising income
          inequality".

          Sorry but isn't that tautological in the modern western world?
          The real question is why is this variance now appearing?

          "Many people get the degree, yet without learning the skills
          they need for the modern workplace. In other words, the world of
          work is changing faster than the world of what we teach
          (surprise, surprise)."

          That's a possible explanation but I suspect it is either wrong
          or, more precisely, very partial. What has changed so
          dramatically about the workplace that the employers now no
          longer value vast swath of diplomas. Furthermore, is there such
          a huge difference between the `lesser trained' (I would say,
          graduates from less prestigious programs) and the others?

          "The lack of skill of those students also raises wage returns
          for those individuals who a) have the degree, b) are self-taught
          about the modern workplace, and c) show the personality skills
          that employers now know to look for. All of a sudden those
          individuals face less competition and so their wages rise".

          How? Unless there's been a drop in the quantity of these top
          students/individuals, why should the returns accrue to them
          simply because there are more badly trained/inadapted students
          lying around? CEOs salaries didn't get higher because we
          increased the supply of low skilled immigrants.

          "there is also more pressure to get an advanced degree to show
          you are one of the privileged, but that is another story."

          I think that's more what needs to be explored. In general, the
          college premium has been stagnating while the top 1% or top 0.1%
          kept on doing well. It seems like a different dynamic at work.

          "Too many discussions of the returns to education focus on the
          mean or median and neglect the variance and what is likely a
          recent increase in that variance".

          I think you ought to look at European experiences, notably
          France's. There is, afaik, nothing `likely' about the increase
          in variance. It is happening. Ditto the compression of the
          college premium and the over-qualification for mundane jobs etc.
          I think the USA is `just' catching up because 1- college is far
          more expensive there so educational attainment was lower in the
          US than Europe and 2- the USA, for a host of reasons, including
          supply-sided ones, had a more dynamic economy in the last 15-20
          years and thus the consequences of this polarisation and
          segmentation were less obvious/were not happening to the same
          extent.

        dearieme June 27, 2013 at 6:06 am
                "educational attainment was lower in the US than Europe":
                I saw that explained recently by the assertion that the
                American high schools were designed to turn out people who
                were literate but not educated.

              [18]Frederic Mari June 27, 2013 at 7:40 am
                      If you mean American high schools focus too much on
                      reading, writing and maths to the exclusion of too
                      much else that's needed in college, I am ill-placed
                      to comment, having no experience with the US system.

                      I think the high price tag of college is a simpler
                      explanation but, well, maybe that's not the whole
                      explanation, fair enough.

   John Thacker June 27, 2013 at 6:12 am
          It's true that jobs that used to not require college education
          now do.

          Another effect is that while the percentage of people going to
          college and getting decreases in increasing, [19]the percentage
          of people (as a percentage of the overall age cohort) getting
          "traditional" majors is stable. The increase in college
          education is entirely in majors that are direct "job
          preparation" type majors, many for jobs that did not used to
          require a bachelor's degree, from nursing to criminal justice to
          undergraduate business majors to actuarial science majors.

        uffy June 27, 2013 at 3:50 pm
                That's interesting data I had not seen before and seems to
                complicate this picture even further. Doesn't seem to
                support the view that the "truly skilled" per capita
                should be declining.

   [20]Ashok Rao June 27, 2013 at 7:10 am
          As someone noted, I doubt bartenders are a representative
          sample, though that doesn't say much because we see this trend
          for file clerks as well. We can't talk about this without
          discussing the debundling of education that is occurring. If you
          take each person's prior normal distribution for future salary,
          which we can never measure but it's a good thinking tool, the
          uncertainty comes from Charles murray like "intangibles" and
          just luck. What you are suggesting when talking about the
          variance of the larger normal distribution is one where
          individual means diverge That may be the case. But the important
          action is that the individual *variances* will increase. The
          variance of variances is where the action is, and the picture
          may not be so bleak ([21]http://bit.ly/10Yavrg):

          "Except it's not the variance that's important. I see it this
          way. Every college student's future earning potential, after
          controlling for background and genetics, is normally
          distributed. The uncertainty arises from intangibles (call this
          the Charles Murray factor) but also dumb luck. As Cowen has it,
          we would agree that it is the variance of means that increases
          when, in fact, it is the variance of variances. There's no way
          to forecast this, or even form a Bayesian prior on what one's
          normal distribution is. But we can assert that it exists, and
          that it will change.

          It's a little tricky to explain why I think this. An increase in
          variance, other things equal, means there's a higher chance that
          someone with a lower mean (because they came from a poor family
          and such) will end up in the top decile. That's clearly not the
          case. So we can take the inequality of prior means to be a
          background condition, the symptom of an unequal country. Within
          this context, the debundling of education will increase the
          variance by allowing students to more accurately target their
          strengths. There's also much more room for falling below the
          curve without the guidance of an environment.

          Net net, you will see that more surprisingly poor kids make it
          "out" in the debundled world, than the counterfactual of our
          current education system. And you'll see more people do even
          worse. So Cowen is right, in a sense, that the variance of the
          aggregate normal distribution will increase. However this is
          predicated on a background trend (inequality) that almost
          guarantees that result. "

   Andrew' June 27, 2013 at 7:30 am
          Thankfully, the education system does a good job with aptitudes,
          opportunity matching and career planning.

   Rahul June 27, 2013 at 7:43 am
          One flaw lies in clubbing all higher education together: There
          doesn't seem to be much falling return to skills such as those
          of doctors, nurses or chemical engineers.

          Not all degrees are made equal. It'd be interesting to see the
          classification by major of these bartenders.

          It's kind of a paradox.

          For some periods in my life, I've had the same income as a bus
          driver. But, thanks to college I learnt to think about the
          future, how to make plans and stick to them, do investments.
          Despite having the same (even less) income as the bus driver, I
          was securing a comfortable financial future. I learnt to do that
          in college, not sure if it was knowledge from classes,
          interacting with other intelligent people, feeling that you may
          me lagging behind all the intelligent people or simply that I
          need money to make a beautiful woman stay by my side. Anyway, I
          learnt.

          Meanwhile, we bash the bus driver for being a simpleton, for not
          educating his kids in the best possible manner, for being
          incapable of doing a little critical thinking. Yes, he's an
          idiot for watching and believing Fox News and not caring about
          savings and investments.

          The case is: I got my financial education during college years
          while I'm not sure about the source. Is there anyway the rest of
          the population can also get financial education without going to
          expensive college so they can also build a secure future?

          It's a funny contradiction, we mock the poor for being unrefined
          and stupid and complain at the same time for spending public
          resources on higher education....on the poor. We are disgusted
          by their ignorance and hate to pay for making them less
          ignorant. Today we complain there's a guy behind a bar with a
          college degree, today also we complain about the old people
          living on welfare cause they could not build a secure financial
          future while young. So, what to do?

          Ps. It would be interesting to compare a population of "guys
          with college degree behind a bar" with a "co-workers without
          college degree" in 30 years to find out if college was a bad
          investment or not.

        Andrew' June 27, 2013 at 9:41 am
                Are you sure that everything you think you learned during
                college years is attributable to college? No, you aren't
                sure. A lot of other people seem sure.

              JWatts June 27, 2013 at 10:21 am
                      Maybe that's where he learned to mock bus drivers?
                      So he fit in with the hip crowd.

          Bartenders can be reasonably well compensated, so I'm not sure
          why having college-educated bartenders is an issue or even
          surprising.

          A college education is no doubt a benefit for those bartending
          positions where interaction with highly educated customers is
          needed. Not coincidentally, these bartending jobs are often
          higher paying.

   [22]Floccina June 27, 2013 at 11:02 am
          I worked with a girl who had graduated with a very high average
          and a degree in in computer science but was not a good
          programmer. I worked with other with great credentials but where
          poor programmers. I have also worked with a guy with AA degrees
          who is an amazing programmer. IMHO programming ability is a
          quirky talent not well measured by schools.

        Peldrigal June 28, 2013 at 10:59 am
                It may not be measured by schools, but sure is valued and
                measured by employers. The two friends of mine that
                everyone recognizes as the best programmers among them,
                dropped from college for a variety of reasons. Both landed
                well paying programming jobs.

          "lesser trained students end up driving cabs"

          And then we invent driverless cabs, and they become ZMP
          workers...

   [23]jseliger June 27, 2013 at 12:05 pm
          The more likely scenario is that the variance of the return to
          having a college education has gone up, and indeed that is what
          you would expect from a world of rising income inequality. Many
          people get the degree, yet without learning the skills they need
          for the modern workplace.

          I also wonder about the extent to which a college degree is now
          part of what I've begun calling a "lottery ticket" effect.
          Students get an undergrad degree because they know it will open
          up some options that might be closed, and, if those options
          don't work out, they go back to bartending, or whatever. Getting
          a degree is part of what Paul Graham calls "[24]staying upwind."

          Furthermore, most 18-year-old high school graduations probably
          don't know very much about themselves or about their real
          prospects five to ten years later. Getting a degree is one way
          of discovering information about their job market skills and
          prospects. If you start working at age 18 you know you're
          unlikely to get a white-collar job at age 24, but if you get a
          degree you have a chance of a white-collar job at age 24 and
          bartending remains a viable fallback.

          "They consider a world where most of the IT infrastructure
          already has been built, and so skilled labor has not so much
          more to do at the margin."

          Yes, that goes along with the world where in the US 60MPH
          passenger and freight rail infrastructure serve every city and
          factory and farm depot, the nuclear power plants are fully built
          out to provide power to cheap to meter, the power grid is built
          to handle failure in a robust fashion to prevent widespread
          failure, the roads and highways are modern and provide capacity
          for decades in the future.

          I can't figure out what happened to economists in the past
          couple of decades where they are so detached from reality where
          capital always fall in value over time.

          Instead the idea that as control over real capital assets is
          centralized, investment in the capital can fall below
          depreciation, but monopoly power allows the returns to be
          maintained or increased, resulting in higher prices for the
          capital even as it falls in value.

          The nuclear power plants are not falling in price fast enough to
          reflect reality, so SONGS had some minimal investment made,
          which had a high price tag, based on SONGS having a high price.
          When the investment made the problems of aging at SONGS worse
          because they did not employ enough college graduates for long
          enough, like for the past decade, all of a sudden, the price of
          SONGS fell below zero to become a huge liability.

          All sorts of scientists and engineers have been looking at US
          infrastructure for decades and predicting doom, and in the
          nuclear R&D sector both government employees and industry
          employees and independent people have been warning of problems
          and recommending actions. But the pressure has been to reduce,
          not merely hiring of college grads in nuclear, but actually
          reducing actual employment.

          One place where advocates of more investment, and where people
          predict looming need for workers is in the career and university
          sector.

          If you have an interest in nuclear, you can easily find lots of
          reasons to study nuclear science and engineering:

          - nuclear power plants worldwide are reaching end of life

          - nuclear solves the pollution problem that coal presents - look
          at smog in Asia

          - new solutions are needed for the 3% used up fuel which is
          currently treated as waste because Jimmy Carter placed a
          temporary halt to reprocessing to extract plutonium for making
          another 10,000 bombs

          - 90% of current nuclear scientists and engineers are over age
          50

          Obviously, graduating with a nuclear degree means a great job
          market because the investment in going to be huge in nuclear in
          just a few years.

          Apply the same to hundreds of skill areas, from civil
          engineering specializing in rail or road transport, in bridges,
          etc, to the trades like welding and machining and large scale
          foundry operations, and there are many exciting career
          opportunities.

          Except political-economists have made investing in actual
          capital too great a burden on society and too high a risk, but
          instead argue that pump and dump asset churn price inflation is
          the solution to creating wealth, which IS growth. And if you
          have growth, jobs are created.

          I grew up in an world where new and higher paying jobs created
          growth.

          But I grew up in a world where investment started with creating
          jobs and those jobs created capital that increased production
          while the income created the demand.

          Now it is a world where government is supposed to create demand
          even as jobs and incomes are cut, but government should not
          create demand by giving welfare or by buying things like nukes
          that will never be used or bridges that replace decaying bridges
          that have not failed yet - instead, government create demand by
          pumping cash into the economy by buying the debt from asset
          churn in an effort to inflate asset prices.

          The Fed is buying MBS on existing capital in order to promote
          churn in real estate to drive up housing prices, because if
          housing prices are going up, the mortgages can be refi'd based
          on the higher prices "creating wealth" and maybe new houses will
          be built creating some jobs, or at worse, after a refi,,,

          ... you will have more money in your pocket to take a cab driven
          by a college grad to dinner where you will be served drinks by a
          college grad bartender and served your meal by a college grad
          waiter.

        Finch June 27, 2013 at 3:46 pm
                Young people are justifiably afraid of majoring in nuclear
                engineering because you never know when the government is
                going to step in and turn your job off forever. There's
                just too much political risk.

                If you were really highly confident in global warming
                forecasts, and you thought that the consequences of global
                warming would be severe for the first world, maybe you
                could be confident that eventually politics would come
                around as nuclear power is the only reasonable solution if
                it's a real problem. But outside of politicians, I don't
                think anyone is all that confident in the science and
                economics. The guy who could be a nuclear engineer could
                also be an electrical engineer, and then he doesn't have
                to deal with all this risk even if he's reasonably
                confident he's right about the problem being real.

                      By confident in the science and economics, I don't
                      mean "confident the earth has warmed some in the
                      past 200 years and people are partially
                      responsible," I mean "confident the earth will warm
                      a lot in the near future and it's worth doing
                      something about it because it will have very serious
                      negative effects for people in Cleveland if we
                      don't." You need to think the second to be confident
                      in a nuclear future.

                      Unless you plan a career in subs. My experience was
                      most of the people in the nuclear engineering
                      department were Navy guys.

                      Young people are justifiably afraid of majoring in
                      nuclear engineering because you never know when the
                      government is going to step in and turn your job off
                      forever. There's just too much political risk. ..
                      The guy who could be a nuclear engineer could also
                      be an electrical engineer,

                      I resemble that remark. And yes, talk to young
                      engineers at the UT Knoxville campus and they'll
                      tell you that choosing nuclear as a career means a
                      future of dwindling options.

                      How good do think all the recent German graduates in
                      nuclear engineering are feeling? My guess is their
                      considering either a) going back to school or b)
                      emigrating.

          "I would sooner say that education doesn't measure true skill as
          well as it used to."

          This one line cuts right through the confusion one might have
          after reading the Orszag article.

   paul June 27, 2013 at 7:43 pm
          The correct return to education is measured in utility, not in
          money. As our society gets wealthier, the cost of forgoing a
          high income job falls, because it does not imply destitution.
          I've spent some years working overseas, and have noticed that
          the offices of many international NGOs like the Clinton
          Foundation are overflowing with young people from top schools,
          who graduated at the top of their classes, and are taking home
          less pay than taxi drivers and bartenders. These are often not
          liberal arts degree holders; these are people who could have
          taken expensive Wall Street jobs but chose not to. Equally the
          many highly educated carpenters of Boulder, or organic farmers
          of Massachusetts.

          The growing norm of finding happiness outside of financial
          success is lowering the measured financial return to education,
          especially to the extent that this norm is most prevalent among
          the highly educated.

   Phil Goetz July 8, 2013 at 8:11 pm
          I'm following you through this point:

          "Rather than accepting "falling returns to skill," I would
          sooner say that education doesn't measure true skill as well as
          it used to. The more likely scenario is that the variance of the
          return to having a college education has gone up, and indeed
          that is what you would expect from a world of rising income
          inequality."

          My interpretation: Education doesn't measure true skill as well,
          and rising inequality has increased the variance of the return
          to having a college education. Unclear whether you mean these to
          be two things that have both happened, two alternatives, or a
          result and a cause. But this much seems clear: You're saying
          rising inequality is the CAUSE of rising variance of college
          degree value.

          This makes sense. In the 1950s, your career would not be greatly
          impacted by getting a doctorate from Harvard vs. from state
          university, and there was not as much income inequality whether
          your career was middling or outstanding. Today, students at
          Harvard / Yale / Princeton / Oxford / Cambridge are the only
          people allowed into the clubs with stratospheric incomes in
          finance, law, & consulting, and are also almost the only people
          who get grants or academic tenure. A degree from Harvard is now
          worth many times more than a degree from Michigan State, because
          rising inequality of income and increased focus on undergraduate
          college on a resume means the jobs you can get with a degree
          from Harvard are worth much more than the jobs you can get with
          a degree from Michigan State.

          Then you suddenly make a 180 turn in mid-paragraph:

          "Many people get the degree, yet without learning the skills
          they need for the modern workplace. In other words, the world of
          work is changing faster than the world of what we teach
          (surprise, surprise). The lesser trained students end up driving
          cabs, if they can work a GPS that is. The lack of skill of those
          students also raises wage returns for those individuals who a)
          have the degree, b) are self-taught about the modern workplace,
          and c) show the personality skills that employers now know to
          look for."

          This is reversing the causality, saying that there is an initial
          variance in skill that CAUSES the variance in income. There's no
          reason to believe this. Even if the world of work changes
          faster, this wouldn't cause any skill differential. It would
          make it equally more-difficult for everyone.

          The only reason to support this view is that it justifies income
          inequality, saying that it is the result of skill inequality,
          and therefore makes rich people feel like they've earned their
          money. But this hypothesis is absurd. The dramatic recent
          increase in income inequality is a result of a sudden,
          unexplained increase in variance of skill?
