   The most contemporary home design ever created, one issue you have to
   move to Mars to live in it.
   This is actually really cool because it was designed to be built by
   robots on mars. Yep mars, though I'm kind of missing the big sweeping
   windows of the red sands and little red men running around with
   scantily clad women. I've clearly read too many John Carter of Mars
   books in my youth. But Robots would mine and craft the materials and
   the result is something that looks both alien and really cool. Check it
