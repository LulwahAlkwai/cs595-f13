[120]The Second Draft of the History of Science

   by Carl Zimmer

   I've been hearing good things for a while now about [121]Retro Report,
   a journalism project that produces 10-to-20-minute-long videos about
   what happened to big headline stories from decades ago. I'm now
   gobbling up my Monday morning watching their backlist. It's excellent
   stuff, and I've been trying to figure out why I like it. I think it's
   because the programs get beyond the simple "Where Are They Now?"
   format. The journalists who make the pieces really report the
   stories-they go back and find people who were in the midst of the news
   to interview them, and then they discover the surprising course of the
   story after it fell away from the world's attention.

   What really surprised me about Retro Report is that most of their
   categories are related in one way or another science. I write about new
   scientific research, and so my job requires me to keep my eyes locked
   on the future, trying to figure out what some discovery or invention
   will mean to generations to come. And the longer you spend in this job,
   the more you start asking yourself, "Hey, what happened to...?" In many
   cases, things quietly take an unexpected-but revealing-turn. Retro
   Report shows that going back to a story about science can reveal
   important lessons about what's going on today, but ones you may not
   have predicted.

   [122]Here, for example, is a piece about a GMO tomato that turned up in
   supermarkets way back in 1994. People went hysterical over the Flavr
   Savr tomato, either as an evil plot or the salvation of our food
   supply. After the cameras were shut off and the reporters went away,
   the company that made the tomato struggled to make a business out of it
   and quietly sold their patent off to GMO giant Monsanto, which then
   quietly shut the project down-arguably because it was boldly labeled in
   stores as genetically modified. Since then, Monsanto has gone on to
   make big profits on GMO plants by making farmers their customers, not
   consumers.

   IFRAME: [123]//player.vimeo.com/video/68929952

   Here's another piece, called [124]Crack Babies. In the 1980s, people
   got frantically worried that crack-addicted women would give birth to a
   generation of brain-damaged infants. The idea-based on some preliminary
   research-turned out to be wrong. Yet it became a wildly successful
   meme, perhaps because it involved a then-new drug and perhaps because
   crack addicts were mostly poor blacks. Retro Report rightly asks why we
   never talk about the threat of "Booze Babies," when alcohol is more
   harmful during pregnancy than crack.

   IFRAME:
   [125]//player.vimeo.com/video/66409924?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&colo
   r=1db4c2

   These videos remind us forcefully that the real meaning of stories
   about science takes time to unfold. That is very hard to remember,
   because there's something intoxicating about a new science story.
   Suddenly some great truth about the world seems to be unveiled. That
   truth can be terrifying, or elating. I can't count all the emails I've
   gotten when I've written a story about some very preliminary research
   on a disease, from people who suffer from the disease and want to know
   where they can go to get cured.

   In reality, a lot of science-related conclusions fall apart or have to
   be revised in later years. Science itself is starting to grapple with
   its flaws, with papers like [126]"Most Published Research Findings Are
   False." On the other hand, some findings gain strength over the years,
   as more and more evidence supports them. But those studies pile up like
   sand grains, and so it's easy for journalists to overlook them, even
   after they've grown into a mountain.

   I hope Retro Report does more investigations into science. They're
   wonderful history lessons, and they also help people think more
   realistically about today's news.

   Other science stories include:

   -[127]Summer of Fire: How this year's massive forest fires are part of
   a 25-year trend, due in part to human activity.

   -[128]Biosphere 2, the sealed building that was supposed to become
   self-sufficient and instead went wrong in a fascinating way.

   -[129]Y2K, the computer bug that terrified the world in 1999 with the
   prospect of computers shutting down on New Years Day.

   -[130]Voyage of the Mobro 4000: an ill-fated voyage of a garbage barge
   that gave rise to the recycling movement.

   (P.S.: Retro Report is a [131]non-profit project. The New York Times,
   where I'm a columnist, distributes Retro Report, but I've not had any
   dealings with them aside from as a viewer.)

       I've really been enjoying the retro reports too. I agree that
       looking back at things like Biosphere 2 and the hysteria over crack
       babies helps keep us humble about the state of scientific knowledge
       today! These reports are pretty addictive.

       So what role do you think journalists and science writers play in
       what stories get forgotten, or which ones are modified to be more
       powerful later? I've long thought it funny that science stories get
       "embargoed" as if they can get scooped, when of course the birds
       that were finding their way using some amazing mechanism, or the
       microbes that produces some incredible compound that makes them
       social, were doing it yesterday and will keep doing it tomorrow.
       Sometimes it seems as if the way science is reported feeds into
       this breathless idea of breaking developments, when that isn't how
       one feels about it when doing it.

       It might just be your over-eager readership -- but it's probably
       also you and the researchers actively overselling the preliminary
       work.
       [CZ: Unlike you, I have great sympathy for people grappling with
       cancer, psychological disorders, and other medical problems. I
       entirely understand how easy it is for them to grab at any glimmer
       of hope. As for my own work, I make the preliminary nature of
       research as clear as possible within the space constraints I deal
       with. If you have a particular story of mine in mind, please
       discuss it. But if this is just speculation based on no article in
       particular, then please keep these empty insults to yourself.]

       From my studies of the history of science, I think the main problem
       is that "science" was expanded beyond the careful, limited, solid
       procedure described by Sir Francis Bacon. Indeed, science is often
       still described in similar terms, in which data gathering and
       inductive reasoning inspire imaginative deductive conclusions (I
       don't know how people can say Bacon's method was simply inductive
       logic) which are then tested by attempts at further repeatable
       observations, with controlled experiments if possible or necessary
       to distinguish between possibilities and clearly demonstrate what
       is actually happening in nature.
       About 200 years later, when "natural philosophers" started calling
       themselves "scientists," they had already started accepting a
       different process, which started with induction and then by simple
       extrapolation extended the inductive conclusions into the past and
       to global and celestial scales, accepting the results as facts
       despite the obvious inability to repeatedly observe or
       experimentally reproduce such events. Flipping the normal practice
       of science on its head, the new conclusions were then used to
       interpret all new data, giving a false appearance of harmonious
       independent support that was actually the result of circular
       reasoning. This is most clearly seen in the extreme form of
       uniformitarian geology which eventually resisted and then was
       overthrown by the evidence for things such as plate tectonics and
       J. Harlan Bretz' Missoula flood.
       Of course, modern pressures from academic reviews, funding sources,
       and even the temptation of fame through sensational news stories
       only exacerbate the problem of scientists stating things without
       proper caveats, and then having to retract them.
       Examples that come to mind include "Bathybius haeckeli"; Langley's
       expensive, army-funded flying experiments ending in failure with
       help from negative press while a pair of brothers with a bicycle
       shop succeeded in building a man-carrying, controlled flying
       machine; Thalidomide causing terrible birth defects; and
       "Nutcracker Man."

       RetroReports has become a `must-see' for me. As a journalist my
       colleagues and I often bemoan the lack of perspective in today's
       reportage. So much of it seems to revolve around celebrities,
       scandalous crimes, minor political tussles, or the constant
       hammering on one main topic at the exclusion of other important
       stories.
       RetroReports stands as a unique example to remind us where we've
       been (via big news events from the past) and with the luxury of
       time-passed what actually came out of those stories that so
       captivated us.
       There's no other service like it out there today. Kudos!

       The problem occurs because you have Humanities-minded people being
       fascinated with the work of Science-minded people. I have two words
       for you: "Cold Fusion." Remember that little media fiasco? It was
       but one example of how the Humanities-minded get all caught up in
       the hype but have no genuine understanding of the facts or, more
       specifically, have no ability to evaluate the details of scientific
       research. I suppose another good example is the eventual eruption
       of Yellowstone: geologists have a genuine understanding of the
       scale of time on which such events are likely to occur; meanwhile,
       all the media people hear are "It's going to erupt BIG!". The
       media-types latch on to whatever can grab a headline and thereby
       foster attention/ratings, because that's what
       journalism/communications programs teach: "appeal to the masses,
       down to the lowest common denominator." Is it any wonder why
       Discovery subsequently produces and promotes a show like
       "Megalodon"?
       [CZ: The announcement of cold fusion came from two physicists, not
       two English majors. It may feel nice to pretend that all the
       problems are off in someone else's domain, but in this case--and in
       the focus on hot science news in general--there's a whole system at
       work that includes not just journalists, but scientific journal
       editors, people who award grants, and scientists themselves.]

       Does anyone else find it incredibly unfortunate that the History of
       Science includes no attempt to prove the theory of mutation-driven
       evolution? Thus, we have had no scientific support for a theory
       widely touted as support for `natural selection." Indeed,
       mutation-driven evolution was finally refuted only yesterday in a
       "Nature Communications" article titled: "An experimental test on
       the probability of extinction of new genetic variants."
       Does anyone think that article will make a difference to
       evolutionary theorists, or can we all expect to continue see the
       propagation of ridiculous mutation-driven evolution in the absence
       of any scientific evidence for it? I hope Retro Report investigates
       the propagation of mutations theory in the absence of any
       scientific evidence for it whatsoever. That fact should be
       considered in the context of the History of Science, and the future
       of scientific pursuits.
    8. David Bump
       September 15, 2013
       Really, James V. Kohl? I only have access to the abstract of that
       Nature article, and naturally that says that all is essentially
       well with the theory, as their study shows the extinction rates
       were "...as expected... as expected..." and "...confirms the key
       results from classical population genetics..." The only hint of
       surprise (let alone refutation) is that "... at intermediate
       frequencies, the fate of invaders might not result in their
       ultimate fixation or loss but on their maintenance" and they
       conclude that "...the nature of adaptation can be complex."
       Something hiding in the main text that you would claim refutes the
       theory? Or are you just saying that the lack of total elimination
       of traits nerfs selection to the point where it wouldn't produce
       significant change over time? but something must be eliminating
       traits, or do we carry the code for all of our ancestors in our
       DNA, or what?
    9. James V. Kohl
       September 15, 2013
       David, thanks for asking, but the article is OPEN ACCESS at
       [132]http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130913/ncomms3417/full/ncomm
       s3417.html
       What I'm saying is without their obfuscation: " Our study confirms
       the key results from classical population genetics ..." As I
       recall, it was studies on peppered moths and industrial melanism
       that led, in part, to the classical misrepresentation of predator
       selection as the mutation-driven force in mutation-driven
       evolution.
       This article addresses the problem with fixation, which can be
       placed into the context of nutrient-dependent pheromone-controlled
       adaptive evolution sans mutations theory, since Darwin's
       `conditions of life' are nutrient-dependent and
       pheromone-controlled. So is the physiology of reproduction in
       species from microbes to man, and reproduction occurs via conserved
       molecular mechanisms that I have detailed with across-species
       examples in my model.
       [133]http://www.socioaffectiveneuroscipsychol.net/index.php/snp/art
       icle/view/20553/27989
       If fixation had ever been linked to mutations, but not to
       nutrient-dependent pheromone-controlled reproduction, the authors
       might have been able to continue to tout theory. Instead, they
       refuted mutation-driven evolution but say "...our results show that
       further empirical work and more theoretical models are required to
       accurately predict the fate of that allele over long time spans."
       They indicate they are simply waiting to begin touting another
       theoretical model.
       Why do we need more theoretical models to predict the fate of any
       allele over long time spans? It is perfectly clear that epigenetic
       effects of the sensory environment arrive via olfactory/pheromonal
       input and control the nutrient-dependent physiology of
       reproduction, which controls the fate of alleles across the
       evolutionary continuum?
       What we need is to simply acknowledge the biological facts. The
       authors of this article do that, but only in passing. They say:
       "Our study confirms... and highlights [the fact] that the nature of
       adaptation can be complex." That complexity is obviously found in
       the systems biology of epigenetically effected alternative
       splicings and fixation of alleles, which is nutrient-dependent and
       pheromone-controlled, which I began modeling in the early 1990's.
       Perhaps I should not have assumed that most people would know that
       new alleles are nutrient-dependent. That assumption led me to think
       it didn't need to be proved, and that most people would accept the
       fact that fixation was pheromone-controlled, not mutation-driven
       and mutation-controlled. I was wrong to expect others would accept
       the facts instead of continuing to accept the theory of
       mutation-driven evolution.

       Re: "Most published research findings are false." Most scientists
       are aware of this possibility and take it into account. If a
       finding is important, it is redone before building on it. The
       problem is ideology. William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and Peter
       Guthrie Tate were happy to use the prestige of physics to claim the
       sun and earth were 20 million years old. They continued to make
       this claim all their lives. Huxley and Haeckel, in Bathybius,
       thought they found the transition between inorganic and organic,
       and Henry F. Osborn believed he had found the remains of a fossil
       man in Nebraska. They were important claims, and they were wrong
       and excepting Kelvin's, who had a choir, were quickly corrected.

            Well, the ideal is to only build on things that have been
            definitely established, say by repeated observations with
            sufficient documentation by various researchers, preferably by
            experiments that control conditions and rule out other
            possibilities. In practice it doesn't always work out that
            way. Also Jonny O pointed out, what gets reported to the
            public may be something quite different. Sadly, textbooks also
            have been shown to be highly fallible, and often unavoidably
            out of date. They included Haeckel's, um, fudged drawings of
            embryos for decades.
            I believe the *known* physics at the time of Kelvin's death
            still favored the Earth and Sun being far less than a billion
            years old. Has there been a way to determine exactly how much
            radioactive material there is in the Earth and how much it
            would affect its heating, or is it assumed or estimated?
            Likewise, I have not heard of any way that evolution, by any
            means, could cross the transition between the chaos or stasis
            of the inanimate to the controlled, organized dynamic
            complexity (CODC) of living things (i.e. "chemical
            evolution"), nor, for that matter to produce all the entirely
            new systems exhibiting CODC of all living things, over any
            amount of time. It's simply the result of philosophical
            necessity, given that explaining the origin and history of
            life is granted the mantle of "science" and science is defined
            as "providing natural explanations for everything."

       Thanks W. Benson. I get that a lot. People think that no evidence
       and a report indicating none will ever be found to scientifically
       support mutation-driven evolution should not quickly be accepted.
       Instead, they prefer to stick with mutation-driven evolution, when
       adaptive evolution is clearly nutrient-dependent and
       pheromone-controlled in species from microbes to man because there
       are examples of cause and effect in species from microbes to man.
       Do you think we should wait another 86 years for the next
       refutation of mutations theory?
   12. James V. Kohl
       September 27, 2013
       "Signaling Crosstalk: Integrating Nutrient Availability and Sex" is
       an excellent representation of how nutrient-dependent
       pheromone-controlled adaptive evolution occurs via conserved
       molecular mechanisms found at the origin of sexual reproduction in
       yeast. I mention this for those who are afraid to comment on the
       fact that mutation-driven evolution has been tossed to the ground
       and kicked aside by biologist bullies who are presenting facts. If
       you have evidence that can be used to stop the bullying, please use
       it.
