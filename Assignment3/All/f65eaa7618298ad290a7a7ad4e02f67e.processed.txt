   What's This?
   Cordle-in-court
   [47]Francis%2520berkman-1670
   By Fran Berkman2013-09-18 15:32:24 UTC

   One viral video and several twists and turns later, Matthew Cordle
   finally kept his promise to accept responsibility for his involvement
   in a fatal crash.

   The 22-year-old pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated vehicular
   homicide and driving while intoxicated in an Ohio courtroom Wednesday
   morning, a week after he pleaded not guilty [48]due to a court
   procedure at his arraignment.

   Crash

   "I drank so much I was blacked out," Cordle told the judge, who asked
   Cordle why he could not remember the details of the night of the
   accident on June 22.

   Prosecutor Ron O'Brien told the court Cordle's blood alcohol level was
   measured at .19, more than twice the legal limit, on the night of the
   accident. He said hospital attendants reported Cordle did not realize
   he had been in a car accident and became hostile when initially asked
   for a blood sample.

   "He's waiving all of his constitutional rights, and he's doing so in an
   expedited manner, in order to honor the promises he's made," W. Martin
   Midian, one of Cordle's attorneys, told the judge.

   Cordle's [50]YouTube confession has amassed more than 2 million views
   since it was posted Sept. 3. In the video, he admits to driving drunk
   at the time of the crash, when Cordle drove his pickup truck the wrong
   way on I-670 in Ohio and crashed into Vincent Canzani's Jeep. Canzani,
   61, was pronounced dead at the scene, the Columbus Dispatch
   [51]reported.

   Many were quick to question Cordle's sincerity when he entered a not
   guilty plea at his arraignment on Sept. 11, but Franklin County
   assistant prosecutor Keith McGrath said Cordle was simply following
   standard operating procedure.

   "This is not unusual," McGrath told Mashable. "Every person that came
   through that arraignment court entered a not guilty plea. It's how you
   get assigned to a random judge here in Franklin County. You have to
   enter that not guilty plea first."

   "When I get charged, I will plead guilty and take full responsibility
   for everything I've done to Vincent and his family," Cordle says in the
   video titled "I Killed a Man," which was posted on the website Because
   I Said I Would. The site encourages people to make promise cards to
   "remember the importance of your commitments and goals."

   Cordle contacted Alex Sheen, the founder of Because I Said I Would, on
   [52]Facebook. Sheen produced and published the confessional video.

   "I thought, like anybody, that he might back down -- he might try to
   pull something that would get him a lighter sentence or something,"
   Sheen told Mashable during a phone conversation last week. "Matt has
   been sticking true to his word, taking what's coming to him -- what he
   deserves."

   At the hearing Wednesday, Cordle's attorneys said he had made a
   "commitment to sobriety," starting with voluntarily entering himself
   into a two-week rehabilitation program when he was released from the
   hospital.

   Cordle faces anywhere from two to eight-and-a-half years in prison and
   a fine of up to $1,675. In addition, the aggravated vehicular homicide
   charge brings a mandatory lifetime drivers license suspension. His
   sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 10.
