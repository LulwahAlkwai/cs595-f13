   Contributions from many parties have enabled and benefitted the
   creation of the HTML edition of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. We
   wish to thank

     * Carver Mead, for his warm encouragement and generous financial
       support, without which this edition would have been impossible,
     * Thomas Kelleher and Basic Books, for their open-mindedness in
       allowing this edition to be published free of charge,
     * Adam Cochran, for tying up the many slippery loose ends that needed
       to come together in order for this edition to be realized,
     * Alan Rice for his steadfast enthusiasm for this project, and for
       rallying the support of Caltech's Division of Physics Math and
       Astronomy,
     * Michael Hartl and Evan Dorn, for the excellent job they did
       converting Volume I of the FLP LaTeX manuscript into HTML.

       MathJax, and scalable vector graphic (SVG) figures. Your browser
       must support javascript and permit scripts from mathjax.org. We
       recommend using a modern browser; some older browsers may not
       display this edition correctly. PNG figures (that degrade when
       scaled) may be served to browsers that do not support SVG. We do
       not support versions of Internet Explorer older than 8.0. For
       information about MathJax features and accessibility options,
       please visit the [6]MathJax User Help page. (This is a work in
       progress. Initially we are publishing Volume I; We hope to
       eventually publish Volumes II and III, and lectures will be posted
       as time and funds permit.)[7]©
