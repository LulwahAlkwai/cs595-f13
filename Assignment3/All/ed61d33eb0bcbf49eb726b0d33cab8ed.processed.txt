   Only Seattle Makes To Internet Cities List
   So much for the technology capital of the world because Silicon Valley
   isn't on the list of top ten greatest internet cities. The criteria was
   speed, availability, openness to innovation, support of public data,
   and security and data privacy. Prague made the list but the home of
   Google didn't. Seattle, closest to Microsoft did though which is kind
   of interesting given Steve Ballmer's latest job change notice. Story is
   in UBM's Future Cities:
