   What's This?

   [48]Android may have a much bigger chunk of the market, but that's
   irrelevant if people are actually using [49]Apple devices more. At
   least that's Apple CEO Tim Cook's take on the market.

   Cook, along with software chief Craig Federighi and head designer
   Jonathan Ive, spoke with [50]Businessweek about the state of the mobile
   phone category. Not surprisingly, Cook wasn't about to abandon Apple's
   premium positioning for market share.

   "There's always a large junk part of the market," he said. "We're not
   in the junk business ... There's a segment of the market that really
   wants a product that does a lot for them, and I want to compete like
   crazy for those customers. I'm not going to lose sleep over that other
   market, because it's just not who we are."

   Regarding Android's commanding share of the mobile phone market, Cook
   cited research showing 55% of all mobile web activity comes from iOS
   devices. He asked, "Does a unit of market share matter if it's not
   being used? For us, it matters that people use our products. We really
   want to enrich people's lives, and you can't enrich somebody's life if
   the product is in the drawer." Cook also pointed out that there are
   many different versions of Android since users don't always upgrade to
   the new ones and manufacturers customize the platform. "I don't think
   of Android as one thing," he said.

   Elsewhere in the article, the three confront the rap that Apple has
   fallen behind on innovation. Ive pointed out that the [52]iPhone 5S's
   fingerprint scanner is breaking new ground: "There are so many problems
   that had to be solved to enable one big idea," he said. "We didn't
   start opportunistically with 10 bits of technology that we could try to
   find a use for to add to our features list."

   Federighi added: "New? New is easy. Right is hard."
