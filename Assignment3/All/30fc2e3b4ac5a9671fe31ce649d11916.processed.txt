[24]My HTC One story (broke and denied warranty) UPDATED

   Posted by [25]baadnewz on Oct 3, 2013 in [26]Articles | [27]4 comments

   I'll try to be as short as I can and not bore everyone to death with my
   sob story.

   Last week, Wednesday (25th September) my HTC One died, I took it out of
   my pocket and it was off, I tried powering it on - nothing, kept the
   vol-down + power button pressed for more than 1 minute, nothing, no
   blinking soft keys lights, dead, kept it charging for 1 hour, no
   charging on led,again nothing. Ultimately I took it to Regenersis
   Romania to be fixed under warranty.

   Along the way Regenersis Romania, did NOT give any information besides
   the "under repair" status. I had to call HTC Romania to find out that
   actually Regenersis Romania does NOT fix the HTC ONE phones here, but
   instead they ship them to Poland and fix them there. Today I called
   again Regenersis to find out whats happening with my phone( 8 days have
   passed since I claimed the warranty), again I got the status "under
   repair". So I called HTC Romania since they were always very nice and
   helpful maybe the can give one more time more information and once
   again they did. They told me that Regenersis Poland denied warranty
   with the code S 400 (which basically means custom software). Now I'm
   asking the HTC representative, how the hell did they saw it was
   unlocked since the phone clearly didn't powered on, either they had to
   replace the battery or the board. if it was the battery I would be
   happy, ok new battery and although the "custom software" would break
   the battery only in 0.1 % of the cases lets say i'm that 0.1%, I would
   gladly pay for the new battery and their trouble (although again
   normally I shouldn't but wth, I want my phone back) and get back in
   business. If they had to replace the board, oh well new board means new
   everything so no way they see it was unlocked, or least probable the
   phone suddenly started to work again andi  couldn't care less about
   everything else(well not quite I'll write below why not) But it seems
   again I was wrong. They only checked the database and saw that I
   unlocked my phone via htcdev (or at least this what my logic dictates
   if you take in consideration what I wrote above). And continuing my
   logic, from that moment they didn't even looked at the phone or the
   defects I reported, unlocked bootloader = no warranty, doesn't matter
   what's wrong with your phone we don't even look.

   I read on forums (xda and others) - again read on forums, take it with
   a grain of salt - that this is somewhat common practice for the
   services to make an extra quick buck but what is funny they didn't even
   mentioned whats broke and how much would cost me to fix it - maybe
   they'll share more information once I'll pick up my phone.

   Now I was saying above that I'll explain why even if the phone would
   suddenly start working I wouldn't be pleased about them denying my
   warranty. I wouldn't be pleased because apart the fact that the phone
   wasn't powering on, I reported 2 other defects to be fixed, defects
   that are under no way related to "custom software", 1st one was the
   pink tint of camera under very low light condition, common problem with
   HTC ONE, problem that from what i hear HTC's directive is to replace
   the phone, no question asked, and 2nd one would be gaps, again nothing
   to do with software. Regenersis decided to ignore everything and denied
   my warranty based on the htc unlock database (see my logic above why I
   argue that they did this based only on IMEI).

   Right now my only possible way to attack this decision is to call
   Customer Protection and let them take it from there. But given how
   things work in Romania, by the time there would be an definitive
   decision for my reclamation, HTC ONE would be as old as HTC Sensation
   is these days.

   While i'm pretty upset about the whole situation, I really want to
   thank HTC Romania for all the information they gave me along they way
   when Regenersis should have given them in the first place

UPDATE

   So due to numerous replies regarding this subject I feel there is need
   to explain a bit more.

   Since I live in Romania, the producer and the post sale service must
   obey European Legislation. European Legislation says that in order to
   void your warranty the producer or the service must prove that the
   issue was generated by the customer. While yes HTC says warranty MIGHT
   be void using unlock there is a "might" there and they have to prove
   that me unlocking my phone is the reason the phone malfunctioned, which
   they didn't, they saw i generated a code for an imei, i could have kept
   that code on a txt on my desktop and never used it. And even if they
   can prove I've used it, they still have to prove that a custom software
   did the damage. sure one can argue, yes flashing roms broke your phones
   - again they have to prove it. in the end flashing a rom is writing 3
   partitions on phone /system /data and boot nothing so critical that can
   make your phone power off for good and forever. Let's say the software
   is bad and rendered the phone unusable, you either get stuck at splash
   screen, or a bootloop, or phone reboots itself without any reason, data
   connection is not stable gps doesn't work etc, even a brick - things
   that can be generated by a software error. but from this to the phone
   not powering on at all is a big difference. is highly unlikely a
   software could to this to a phone, and even if it did they have to
   prove it 1st before voiding my warranty. As i said even a bricked
   device is visible to a PC when connected and can be fixed

   I know some will argue, that with unlock you can flash a custom kernel
   and overclock the hell out of the cpu and gpu and this might end its
   life, but before it kills it, there will be some signs like
   overheating, instability reboots etc, and it will be signs of
   overheating on the board itself, which is not the case.
   So as I argued before a bad software at most can cause instability, or
   the phone not to boot, but at least you have bootloader or something.
   even if you brick it as the lingo goes, the phone will still be visible
   to the PC as QHSUSB_DLOAD in device manager and can be fixed. but from
   this to not powering on at all is difference.

   I really hope I can solve this without paying money for repair, because
   unless they can prove it is my fault for this defect. will be like
   feeding the beast, confirming them that this kind of practice is OK.

   This is it, thanks for reading, I know i said i'd be short but I got
   carried away. I hope this article will help me get the phone repaired
   without additional charge, and help others who run into these kind of
   issues.

Update 04 October 2013

   HTC Romania escalated this problem to their superiors and waiting for
   reply
   HTC international asked for my ticket no. and said they will look into
   it. hope is up again.

   For now I can only blame Regenersis for their [28]shady practices. This
   link only confirms my logic. Sure one can blame HTC for their poor
   choice of outsourcing companies, but at least here in Romania,
   Regenersis is the go-to service for all major producers and carriers(
   Regenersis services Samsung, BB, Apple, Vodafone etc.) . And at least
   until now HTC escalated the situation in an effort to solve my problem.
   Remains to be seen if they can come through.
