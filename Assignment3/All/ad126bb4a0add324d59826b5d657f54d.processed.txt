   War on Patent Trolls Begins with Large Marketing Campaign
   While we Geeks know and generally hate firms that acquire patents for
   pennies on the dollar in order to blackmail companies into paying them
   for protection from those patents the general public is in the dark
   about what this costs them. Yes these legal fees go right to the price
   off the offering and company is immune. Apparently there is a campaign
   beginning this Friday to make the public aware that they too are being
   screwed and it will spread across 17 states in print (does anyone still
   read print) and radio (radio ?!?). Background article on NPR today:
