   Renée James Elected President


   SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 2, 2013 - Intel Corporation announced today
   that the board of directors has unanimously elected Brian Krzanich as
   its next chief executive officer (CEO), succeeding Paul Otellini.
   Krzanich will assume his new role at the company's annual stockholders'
   meeting on May 16.


   Krzanich, Intel's chief operating officer since January 2012, will
   become the sixth CEO in Intel's history. As previously announced,
   Otellini will step down as CEO and from the board of directors on May
   16.


   "After a thorough and deliberate selection process, the board of
   directors is delighted that Krzanich will lead Intel as we define and
   invent the next generation of technology that will shape the future of
   computing," said Andy Bryant, chairman of Intel.


   "Brian is a strong leader with a passion for technology and deep
   understanding of the business," Bryant added. "His track record of
   execution and strategic leadership, combined with his open-minded
   approach to problem solving has earned him the respect of employees,
   customers and partners worldwide. He has the right combination of
   knowledge, depth and experience to lead the company during this period
   of rapid technology and industry change."


   Krzanich, 52, has progressed through a series of technical and
   leadership roles since joining Intel in 1982.


   "I am deeply honored by the opportunity to lead Intel," said Krzanich.
   "We have amazing assets, tremendous talent, and an unmatched legacy of
   innovation and execution. I look forward to working with our leadership
   team and employees worldwide to continue our proud legacy, while moving
   even faster into ultra-mobility, to lead Intel into the next era."


   The board of directors elected Renée James, 48, to be president of
   Intel. She will also assume her new role on May 16, joining Krzanich in
   Intel's executive office.


   "I look forward to partnering with Renée as we begin a new chapter in
   Intel's history," said Krzanich. "Her deep understanding and vision for
   the future of computing architecture, combined with her broad
   experience running product R&D and one of the world's largest software
   organizations, are extraordinary assets for Intel."


   As chief operating officer, Krzanich led an organization of more than
   50,000 employees spanning Intel's Technology and Manufacturing Group,
   Intel Custom Foundry, NAND Solutions group, Human Resources,
   Information Technology and Intel's China strategy.


   James, 48, has broad knowledge of the computing industry, spanning
   hardware, security, software and services, which she developed through
   leadership positions at Intel and as chairman of Intel's software
   subsidiaries -- Havok, McAfee and Wind River. She also currently serves
   on the board of directors of Vodafone Group Plc and VMware Inc. and was
   chief of staff for former Intel CEO Andy Grove.
