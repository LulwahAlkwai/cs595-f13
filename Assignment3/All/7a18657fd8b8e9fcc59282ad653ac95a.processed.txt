   Scientists from Saudi Arabia and the United States have reported
   finding a partial match for the MERS coronavirus in a sample taken from
   a bat in Saudi Arabia.

   The fragment of viral DNA was extracted from a fecal swab from an
   Egyptian tomb bat - the species' proper name is Taphozous perforatus -
   in the western part of the country. The bat is an insect eater, and is
   often found among fruit trees because the fruit attracts insects.
   [86]Story continues below

   The small fragment is a perfect match for the corresponding portion of
   the MERS virus isolated from Saudi Arabia's first known case, a man who
   died in June 2012. The bat was found in a colony that roosted in ruins
   near where the man lived.

   This the first time a match for the human virus - even a fragment of it
   - has been found in samples taken from an animal. But while the finding
   adds further support for the widely held suspicion that the new
   coronavirus originated in bats, the fragment isn't large enough to say
   definitely that the bat virus was identical to the MERS coronavirus, an
   expert said.

   If the scientists had been able to sequence the full genetic blueprint
   of the bat virus differences between it and the human virus might have
   been spotted, explained Andrew Rambaut, a professor of molecular
   evolution at the University of Edinburgh who has been following the
   MERS story.

       novel coronavirus: 9 things you should know about MERS

   "There's still potential for it to be relatively distant if we had the
   complete genome," he said in an interview.

   "It's definitely implicated in the story, but we don't quite know where
   it lies in that story."

   The report was published online Wednesday in Emerging Infectious
   Diseases, a journal published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
   It was reported by scientists from the Saudi Ministry of Health,
   Columbia University and the organization EcoHealth Alliance.

   Lead author Dr. Ziad Memish, the Saudi deputy minister of health, said
   bats have always been suspected to be the original source of the virus,
   but there are probably other players of the chain of transmission that
   haven't yet been identified.

   "There must be something in the middle," Memish said during a talk on
   MERS in Washington, D.C., that was organized and webcast by the
   University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Center for Health Security.

   "Is it food? Is it (an)other animal reservoir? That's something to be
   determined."

   The finding is one that senior author, Dr. Ian Lipkin, has publicly
   spoken about in the past. In early July, he said in an interview with
   The Canadian Press that he might not publish the results because of the
   limited size of the fragment.

   It would have been bigger, but for a heartbreaking twist of fate.

   Last October, researchers from Lipkin's Center for Infection and
   Immunity at Columbia University and from EcoHealth Alliance gathered
   different types of samples - blood, fecal swabs and fecal pellets -
   from seven species of bats they found roosting in abandoned buildings
   near Bisha, near where the first Saudi MERS case lived.

   The samples were shipped back to the United States for testing in
   Lipkin's lab, which is famous for finding new viruses.

   However, a mixup occurred at customs when the samples reached the
   United States. The material sat at room temperature for two days. All
   the samples, which had been shipped frozen, thawed. As a result, the
   material degraded. Lipkin's team hoped to be able to extract more DNA
   from the sample, but they were unable to because of the poor state of
   the specimen.

   Then a group of international scientists reported finding a coronavirus
   in a South African bat that was a close relative - the closest seen to
   date - to the MERS virus. Lipkin said he felt it was important to get
   his team's finding into the scientific record.

   "I looked at that and I said: `Well, that's clearly not the closest
   match. If that's what's out there, we need to put this out."`

   He put the finding in context this way: "Let's say you're looking for a
   fingerprint at a crime scene. And you'd love to get all four fingers,
   right? But you've got half of one finger and it's a perfect match.
   That's enough, if you have the rest of the evidence, to say yes, this
   was certainly somebody who was here at the scene of the crime.

   "And that's what we're saying. This is a bat that clearly has a virus
   that is identical in this region (of the genome). So that's good enough
   to make that link."

   Rambaut agreed the finding is important but noted it doesn't help
   answer the key question about MERS: How are people being infected by a
   bat virus?

   Many scientists believe, as Memish does, that another type of animal or
   animals is serving as a bridge, getting infected by bats and then
   transmitting the virus to people. But Rambaut believes it is possible
   that there is no other animal bridge. Bats might be infecting people
   indirectly by contaminating something people eat or drink, for
   instance.

   "I think it's a tantalizing clue, but it's too early to say whether it
   is a virus that has given rise to that human case directly from the bat
   or whether there is an intermediate host that is spreading it through
   the area," Rambaut said of the viral fragment.

   More pieces of the MERS puzzle may come into focus soon. Lipkin said
   his lab has been testing blood and other samples from camels and other
   animals from Saudi Arabia and he expects to publish the results within
   a few weeks.

   Suspicion has shifted to camels of late, after another group of
   scientists reported finding antibodies to MERS or a closely related
   coronavirus in camels in Oman and in the Canary Islands, off North
   Africa. As well, a few - though certainly not the majority - of people
   who have become infected with MERS reported having had contact with
   camels before they became ill.

   Rambaut said the jury is still out on camels, suggesting that while
   they appear to be susceptible to the virus, it's not clear they play
   any role in passing it to people.

   To date there have been 97 confirmed cases of MERS and 46 of those
   infections have ended in death.

   All cases have originated from four Middle Eastern countries - Saudi
   Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. MERS infections
   have also been diagnosed in Britain, France, Italy, Tunisia and
   Germany. But in these instances the virus was brought into the country
   by someone who had travelled in the Middle East before getting sick or
   who travelled to Europe by air ambulance seeking care.
