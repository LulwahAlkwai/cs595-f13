   Summary:

   If history has taught us anything, then the line between patterns and
   fallacies is nearly invisible. In a place where we talk about inventing
   the future, the patterns (or fallacies) of the past can prove to be
   counterproductive and create unnecessary biases.

   At the start of every day I make myself three promises -- I will limit
   the amount sugar I consume, have little or no salt and whatever I do, I
   will not let my preconceived notions come in the way of learning. I am
   successful about half the time, but rest of the time I am faced with my
   own limitations and weaknesses. A scone here, a little curry there, and
   of course, looking back into the past and making a snap judgement about
   something in the future -- such as my [38]inability to grok Vine.

   The fact is that we use patterns we have seen throughout our lives and
   we start to draw conclusions based on those patterns. As we grow older,
   we accumulate more data in our brains and as a result to start to rely
   on the patterns generated by that data more and more. As a result, we
   often find ourselves unable to recognize change, embrace change or
   realize that something might actually be different than what came
   before it.

   [39]paulgraham_240x3203 And the patterns we rely on lead to
   physiological biases -- a concept that Naseem Nicholas Taleb explored
   in his [40]Black Swan Theory. A simpler way of explaining that is if
   you walk looking backward, you are more than likely to run into a pole,
   a tree or a car. And while I don't mean to discount the pattern
   recognition, I would say we should think of it -- at best -- as an
   ephemeral yardstick of accumulated wisdom.

   So why am I talking about patterns? Because I read this interview of
   Paul Graham, who started YCombinator, a startup incubator based in
   Mountain View, California. He told the [41]Inc magazine the following:

     One quality that's a really bad indication is a CEO with a strong
     foreign accent. I'm not sure why. It could be that there are a bunch
     of subtle things entrepreneurs have to communicate and can't if you
     have a strong accent. Or, it could be that anyone with half a brain
     would realize you're going to be more successful if you speak
     idiomatic English, so they must just be clueless if they haven't
     gotten rid of their strong accent. I just know it's a strong pattern
     we've seen.

   [42]Graham, who made a similar observation in a story in the New York
   Times, later [43]tweeted to clarify that what he meant was that accents
   "so strong that people can't understand them. It's fine if founders
   merely have accents."

Accented nuances

   Paul and YCombinator have backed many successful companies that are
   headed by people with accents. I also understand that what he told Inc
   magazine (and the New York Times earlier) was a factual observation
   from the data collected and had the context of nuance. When he made
   those comments to the media, he was talking about the negative
   influence of accents from the context of Demo Days.

   But unless you know the context or nuance of Graham's observation, this
   observation quickly becomes a fact in our age of instant amplification
   and in the process create unwarranted biases, which ultimately eat away
   at the meritocratic foundations of Silicon Valley. Sure, a heavy accent
   can make things difficult to understand in a 2-minute pitch on a demo
   day in a room full of venture capitalists -- most with some form of
   ADD. In this hot house, if you can't communicate your vision properly,
   then your chances of success are less than stellar.

   The inability to communicate is merely not an issue of
   difficult-to-understand accents but also includes the inability to
   articulate your idea, stage fright or simply social awkwardness. They
   are all going to cause communication problems with investors, employees
   and even in real-world relationships.

   Think of it this way: If YC is the best-way router of startups and
   innovation, and if investors flock to demo days because they believe
   Graham and Co. have identified the best options, then it doesn't matter
   if you have a Skype or a Tidemark -- you might get left out because you
   have an accent. That to me makes no sense. But if a two-minute pitch on
   a demo day is defining the candidate selection process, then perhaps
   there is a need to change the lens through which we view the world.

   Whenever we talk about accents, race or gender, I was reminded of that
   scene from Moneyball, when Oakland Athletics general manager Billy
   Beane -- after having lost Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason
   Isringhausen -- is sitting in a room with his scouts. The scouts are
   talking about various players and one of them says, "He passes the eye
   candy test. He's got the looks, he's great at playing the part. He just
   needs to get some playing time."

   Those baseball experts were falling back on fallacies -- arguments that
   sounded good even though facts stated otherwise. And so will Silicon
   Valley if we don't constantly question the patterns themselves. Just
   because you hit the ball out of the park three times in a row doesn't
   mean the fourth swing will also result in a home run.

   [44]Silicon Valley & The Scent of Money

Innovation is a universal language

   In my Silicon Valley (which is a symbiosis of an idea and an ideal and
   not a physical landmass), an accent is not a barrier to entry to
   innovation and or a measure of one's entrepreneurial ability. Andy
   Grove, the legendary chief executive of Intel and a Hungarian by birth,
   has an accent. Andy Bechtolsheim, who hails from Germany and started
   Sun Microsystems and more recently created Arista Networks, has a mild
   accent. And so do Vinod Khosla (Sun, Khosla Ventures) and Jayshree
   Ullal (Arista Networks.) How about Arianna Huffington and the founders
   of Zoosk -- Alex Mehr and Shayan Zadeh? What did their accents sound
   like when they were starting out -- like they do today? Maybe, maybe
   not.

   [45]Arista's Andy Bechtolsheim at GigaOM RoadMap 2011

   They all have accents -- which is just a euphemism for voices that
   sound different from how we believe people should sound. "There is an
   enormous amount of information carried in the accent and the prosody of
   human speech," my friend Steve Crandall wrote to me last night,
   pointing out that while we might be comfortable with watching animated
   characters, we still want human accents instead of computer-generated
   voices. Accents add texture to our world.

   Then, perhaps, what is being viewed as a pattern is nothing more than a
   fallacy, in other words a misguided pattern of reasoning and nothing
   more. What really is an accent? I mean everyone speaks with an accent.
   Accents are what make us unique. In our post-internet connected world,
   we are all locals and all foreigners -- somewhere. When I talk to my
   colleagues, I have an Indian accent. When I am in India, my family
   thinks I have an American accent.

   I think a lot of people who speak differently from a group don't quite
   realize that they have an accent. I often argue with my mum or my
   colleagues that I don't have an accent -- or at least that voice in my
   head doesn't think I have an accent. Just a simple act of listening to
   my own podcasts is good enough to show my inner voice -- I sound
   different than I think.

An interconnected world without borders

   The issue of accents is highly personal for me. In the early days as an
   immigrant in my new homeland, I found my attempts at getting interviews
   with media organizations ended abruptly mostly because people found me,
   my name and my accent strange. I guess I was different than others.
   Then one day, I learned of a job I desperately wanted. [46]After about
   a few dozen messages and many faxed resumes later, Forbes.com founding
   editor David Churbuck thought that my accent wasn't that strange after
   all and hired me. Those early rejections prepared me for one thing --
   not taking no for an answer. Adversity is and will always be a
   self-selecting process.

   That one chance changed my life. We need to take a chance -- on the
   weird, the crazy, the funny sounding and odd looking -- they just might
   change the status quo. The fact of the matter is that it is not the
   entrepreneurs who should be rejected based on their accents, but
   instead it should be investors.

   After all, if an investor who doesn't have a few extra minutes to
   understand a founder who might be different will also be unable to find
   compassion and empathy [47]when the shit does hit the fan. How can you
   take any investor seriously if instead of focusing on technical prowess
   and power of the mind, they have a bias against how you look, what
   gender you belong to and how you speak. [48]Why have a bias against
   couples as founders?

   There is one pattern which has mattered in Silicon Valley in the past
   -- a pattern of brilliance. And it is the only pattern that should
   matter -- everything else is just a fallacy.

   Update: Paul Graham on Friday, August 29 [49]elaborated on what he
   meant when talking to the reporter.

       Thanks for writing this. I was quite baffled by Paul Graham's
       comments in the Inc. article, and could find no good way to explain
       it, especially coming from the 500startups program, where
       international founders are actively courted and welcomed. During
       pitch prep, the 500startups staff brought in a speech instructor
       and helped simplify the pitches so that everyone, regardless of
       accent and English proficiency, could deliver a 3 minute pitch that
       is clear and easy to understand. Turns out, it is not that hard
       compared to building a successful company.

       I feel sorry for Paul Graham and for his terrible mistake or may be
       narrow minded view, measuring people by accents.
       Please don't forget that even if you are born somewhere in the USA,
       you will have an accent in another state (:-)).
       Success is not a function of accent and in fact a lot of the
       Silicon Valley successes is built by various accents owners. The
       numbers and the reality speak higher than opinions.

       Bravo. Another nostalgia moment, Om.
       I worked for a spell long ago in another universe called Louisiana.
       Moved there from New England. I couldn't have sounded more
       different if I tried. Louisiana accents are soft and subtle - but
       distinctive.
       So, I put a sign up at the entrance to my work area, "DANGER! NORTH
       AMERICAN WILD YANKEE. Please do not feed."
       Humor worked. Even with one co-worker who was a KKK member.

       Thanks Om. Having come from India, I brought my accent along.
       Before I came to the United States, I lived in a few countries
       (Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and France) and in each country, I
       thought I should do something to change my accent but when I looked
       around, I saw that every other person had an accent too. Finally, I
       gave up on doing anything about it.
       Although I have not been directly affected by this, in my heart I
       know that some people find it difficult to understand what I am
       saying (especially when I am speaking in public) so I go out of my
       way to prepare a lot more - have compelling slides to help me get
       my point across, work on stories that will help clarify a point. In
       a way, having that limitation has made more more humble and prepare
       a lot more than someone who won't have that problem.
       On a lighter note, I was at Inbound conference last week and heard
       Arianna Huffington speak. She addresses this topic right at the
       beginning of her keynote (please watch: 00:30 to 1:05) here:

       Om,
       I followed your twitter feed re: this topic and had a few
       light-hearted exchanges with Lydia Leong of Gartner re: this topic.
       Personally, I don't (and hope others also don't) think for a moment
       that PG is a racist, his essays reveal a deep level of thinking and
       ability to simplify complexity into a layman's language.
       Communication is a fundamental principle of any human action, and
       it is imperative that people "communicate" effectively. However,
       communication is a 2-way street where the listener must also make a
       full effort to understand what is being communicated - verbally and
       non-verbally. In today's hyper-connected world, people, especially
       VCs who hide behind ADD to justify poor etiquette - like checking
       emails, interrupting - need to stay grounded and pay attention to
       what is being communicated.
       Entrepreneurship isn't a sole specialization of America or
       Americans, although the bulk of investors and investment money is
       focused on America. Everyone of us has a different identity and
       biases, and where PG needs to correct his position (attributed or
       otherwise) is in opening his mind to where his ilk can add value to
       the discussion instead of mindlessly discarding ideas, people and
       businesses based on surface level characteristics and assumptions.

            No one who ever says something totally clueless about brown
            people or how they speak is every really a racist, just
            misunderstood.
            Clueless about women who can't take a little harmless
            flirting.
            Clueless about utterly inane startups receiving millions to
            launch yet another paradigm shifting me-too social portal
            while real businesses started by people who didn't happen to
            go to Stanford can't raise a nickle.
            Clueless is a 23 year old millionaire complaining about all
            the bothersome proles begging for food killing his caffeine
            buzz or perhaps god forbid putting a scratch on his Porsche.
            It's about men and women with nothing more than the shirt on
            their backs (and the connections that come with an elite
            education) being freed from having to deal with people not
            like them mucking things up.

       Om,
       I'm on the fence about this one. I was lucky enough to come to the
       US at an age where I never developed an accent and spoke English as
       if it were my native language (albeit with a NY accent). At the
       same time, here in Germany, where I've lived for over 17 years I
       still to this day have a very heavy accent in German. Every native
       speaker immediately knows I am either from the US or the UK.
       Usually they presume UK as I am fairly fluent in German (more so
       the case for Brits than Americans in their minds).
       Anyway, my point is that I too was always aware of my accent. It
       was even heavier in the early days but I made an effort to remedy
       that. At the same time, I never considered going to a language
       course where someone would try to "get rid off" my accent. It
       defines me here in my role. Everyone knows I speak with this heavy
       accent in German (think Schwarzenneger's English but in reverse
       back in Terminator days) and I made sure I am always
       comprehensible.
       It's a fine line in terms of what Paul writes. Yes, one should
       never discriminate against a heavy accent when picking founders yet
       at the same time, if a founder doesn't do his best to become
       "understandable", where else is he lacking? I got the gist of what
       Paul wrote yet I can see where misinterpretation would be possible.
       At the same time, living the problem in another language I know
       what it means to "make it work" and technically, no one is held
       back (unless due to physical issues) from improving their accent.
       As a VC I always told entrepreneurs here in the EU that if they
       ever wanted to go to the US, they better speak understandable
       English or they are toast.

            Paul,
            Can you elaborate on the demographic for whom the founder
            should "become understandable"? Learning English (since
            English is the language referred to in PG's interview) when
            one isn't taught English starting from school-level takes a
            significant amount of effort later in life; developing an
            American-friendly accent comes off as insincere at worst and
            ineffective at best. People end up feeling like caricatures.
            I speak 4 languages, have tried my hand at learning Japanese,
            French and Spanish, and I know the struggle of learning a new
            language as an adult. Not impossible, but nowhere near native
            skill levels.
            Given this context of struggle with a language, should a
            founder invest in learning the nuances of English or focus on
            running his/her business?
            If I were to turn the tables on PG and his team, why don't
            they learn Mandarin, Arabic, Japanese or Hindi in order to be
            the valuable advisors they claim to be?

                 Yes Naveen, I can easily define the demographic: VC's.
                 All US VC's (as well as most international VC's) speak
                 English (and many with accents). Further, that
                 demographic includes customers. In the US you will mostly
                 be speaking English when pitching your product. Hence
                 "you want my money, you speak my language". I didn't say
                 anything about "accent". I said understandable English.
                 By "understandable" I mean fairly correct grammar-wise
                 and with a decent level of technical vocabulary.
                 The argument that VC's or customers should learn your
                 language is ridiculous. It's the US and the language is
                 English. If you can't pitch or get your point across, you
                 are going to have a very difficult time. Hence as a VC
                 and to help the entrepreneurs I was speaking to, I made
                 sure they were prepared.

       a brilliant and great reminder for many of us. "... book by it's
       cover"..? yeah, we all do that.

       Interesting article, Thank you @Om!
       As a US immigrant from Germany, I have an accent. Most people think
       it's light but there are some people who just cannot understand a
       word I say.
       My point: "hard to understand accent" is a relative thing.
       Having said that, the ability to communicate effectively is
       important.
       Best,
       Natascha

       Om,
       Even though I have lived in the US for 25 years, I still have a
       strong French accent.
       Some like it, some don't. I don't loose sleep over it.
       As you write, one is made aware of her/his accent when listening to
       a recording of their voice.
       Regarding language, we might be confusing 2 things here, accent and
       vocabulary, fluency.
       Coming from Europe (same must be true for people from India), I
       knew British English and had to learn differences with American
       English.
       Having lived in same state since I came to the US, for past few
       years, i introduce myself as `The French Guy from New Jersey' which
       often breaks the ice.
       My 2 cents

       Thanks for a great article Om. I am not in what context PG said
       that but definitely no entrepreneur wants to work with folks who
       cannot see world beyond accents. I am indian and i have been living
       in the bay area for the past 13 years. Though my startup failed i
       dont think it failed because of my heavy accent.
       People who think accent is a problem, please take a look at this
       presentation -
