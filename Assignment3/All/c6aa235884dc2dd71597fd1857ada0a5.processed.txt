Sea Change: Pacific Ocean takes perilous turn

   Ocean acidification, the lesser-known twin of climate change, threatens
   to scramble marine life on a scale almost too big to fathom.

   Center on Crisis Reporting.

   NORMANBY ISLAND, Papua New Guinea -- Katharina Fabricius plunged from a
   dive boat into the Pacific Ocean of tomorrow.

   She kicked through blue water until she spotted a ceramic tile attached
   to the bottom of a reef.

   A year earlier, the ecologist from the Australian Institute of Marine
   Science had placed this small square near a fissure in the sea floor
   where gas bubbles up from the earth. She hoped the next generation of
   baby corals would settle on it and take root.

   Fabricius yanked a knife from her ankle holster, unscrewed the plate
   and pulled it close. Even underwater the problem was clear. Tiles from
   healthy reefs nearby were covered with budding coral colonies in
   starbursts of red, yellow, pink and blue. This plate was coated with a
   filthy film of algae and fringed with hairy sprigs of seaweed.

   Instead of a brilliant new coral reef, what sprouted here resembled a
   slimy lake bottom.

   Isolating the cause was easy. Only one thing separated this spot from
   the lush tropical reefs a few hundred yards away.

   Carbon dioxide.

   UNHEALTHY REEF: Algae and seaweed crowd out reef growth on a tile
   placed near Papua New Guinea's CO[2] vents. The more corrosive water
   mirrors what's expected throughout the world's oceans near the end of
   this century.

   In this volcanic region, pure CO[2] escapes naturally through cracks in
   the ocean floor. The gas bubbles alter the water's chemistry the same
   way rising CO[2] from cars and power plants is quickly changing the
   marine world.

   In fact, the water chemistry here is exactly what scientists predict
   most of the seas will be like in 60 to 80 years.

   That makes this isolated splash of coral reef a chilling vision of our
   future oceans.

`High rates of extinction' to come?

   Imagine every person on Earth tossing a hunk of CO[2] as heavy as a
   bowling ball into the sea. That's what we do to the oceans every day.

   Burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, belches carbon
   dioxide into the air. But a quarter of that CO[2] then gets absorbed by
   the seas -- eight pounds per person per day, about 20 trillion pounds
   a year.

   Unhealthy reef: Fabricius records data from instruments placed
   alongside corals in the CO[2] vents off Dobu Island.

   Scientists once considered that entirely good news, since it removed
   CO[2] from the sky. Some [21]even proposed piping more emissions to
   the sea.

   But all that CO[2] is changing the chemistry of the ocean faster than
   at any time in human history. Now the phenomenon known as ocean
   acidification -- the lesser-known twin of climate change -- is helping
   push the seas toward a great unraveling that threatens to scramble
   marine life on a scale almost too big to fathom, and far faster than
   first expected.

Join the conversation

   Ocean acidification could disrupt marine life on an almost unfathomable
   scale. What are your thoughts and reactions?

   [22]Post a comment ->

   Here's why: When CO[2] mixes with water it takes on a corrosive power
   that erodes some animals' shells or skeletons. It lowers the pH, making
   oceans more acidic and sour, and robs the water of ingredients animals
   use to grow shells in the first place.

   Acidification wasn't supposed to start doing its damage until much
   later this century.

   Instead, changing sea chemistry already has [23]killed billions of
   oysters along the Washington coast and at a hatchery that draws water
   from Hood Canal. It's helping [24]destroy mussels on some Northwest
   shores. It is a suspect in the softening of clam shells and in the
   death of [25]baby scallops. It is dissolving a tiny plankton species
   eaten by many ocean creatures, from auklets and puffins to fish and
   whales -- and that had not been expected for another 25 years.

   And this is just the beginning.

   Ocean acidification also can bedevil fish and the animals that eat
   them, including sharks, whales, seabirds and, of course, bigger fish.
   Shifting sea chemistry can cripple the reefs where fish live, rewire
   fish brains and attack what fish eat.

   Those changes pose risks for our food, too, from the frozen fish sticks
   pulled from the grocer's freezer to the fillets used in McDonald's fish
   sandwiches, to the crab legs displayed at Pike Place Market, all
   brought to the world by a Northwest fishing industry that nets half the
   nation's catch.

   And this chemical change is not happening in a vacuum.

     Island reefs of Papua New Guinea offer a window on our future, while
     fishing ports in Alaska and along the Washington coast show how the
     deterioration of food webs could strike close to home.

   Globally, overfishing remains a scourge. But souring seas and ocean
   warming [26]are expected to reduce even more of the plants and animals
   we depend on for food and income. The changes will increase ocean
   pests, such as jellyfish, and make the system more vulnerable to
   disasters and disease. The transformation will be well under way by the
   time [27]today's preschoolers reach middle age.

   "I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go
   extinct," said James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
   Institute in California. "But this change we're seeing is happening so
   fast it's almost instantaneous. I think it might be so important that
   we see large levels, high rates, of extinction."

   Globally, we can arrest much of the damage if we bring down CO[2] soon.
   But if we do not, the bad news won't stop. And the longer we wait, the
   more permanent the change gets.

   "There's a train wreck coming and we are in a position to slow that
   down and make it not so bad," said Stephen Palumbi, a professor of
   evolutionary and marine biology at Stanford University. "But if we
   don't start now the wreck will be enormous."

   You might think that would lend the problem urgency. So far, it
   has not.

   Combined nationwide spending on acidification research for eight
   federal agencies, including grants to university scientists by the
   National Science Foundation, totals about $30 million a year -- less
   than the annual budget for the coastal Washington city of Hoquiam,
   population 10,000.

   The federal government has spent more some years just studying sea
   lions in Alaska.

   So to understand how acidification could transform marine life, The
   Seattle Times crisscrossed the world's greatest ocean, from the
   sun-dappled reefs of the South Pacific to the ice-encrusted surface of
   the Bering Sea.

How much carbon are we putting into the ocean?

   We're dumping the equivalent of a hopper car of coal -- about 100 U.S.
   tons -- into the ocean every second.

   Acidification will strike every ocean, and no one can predict exactly
   how things will look -- the seas are too complex for that.

   But the island reefs of Papua New Guinea's Milne Bay province offer a
   window on our future, while fishing ports in Alaska and along the
   Washington coast show how damage to fish brains and the deterioration
   of food webs may strike close to home.

A disturbing glimpse of the future

   Papua New Guinea's Solomon Sea island vents are remarkable because of
   where they are: in shallow waters normally fringed by coral reefs as
   striking as fields of wildflowers.

   These remnants of earthquakes or eruptions come in all shapes:
   mini-geysers, a giant crack that burps basketball-size blobs of gas,
   rows of pinprick holes in the sand that exhale curtains of
   Champagne bubbles.
   [32260e97e68c753eb02711c1dd92654f.jpg]

   Katharina Fabricius swims through carbon-dioxide bubbles off Papua New
   Guinea. The waters here offer a glimpse of how acidification is likely
   to transform the seas.

   As Fabricius glided through earlier this year, a bleak
   portrait emerged.

   At dusk on the upper deck of the M/V Chertan, biologist Anna
   Kluibenschedl, at microscope, documents marine life growing on a tile
   removed from the reef off Normanby Island.
   [5138f130a91291aa3d71fc8893c4dbd0.jpg]
   Children help biologist Joy Smith cart plastic tubs of coral and
   sediment through the jungle on Normanby Island, Papua New Guinea. She
   is studying whether CO[2] might harm tiny animals at the bottom of the
   marine food chain. [28]View photo gallery ->

   Instead of tiered jungles of branching, leafy reefs or a watery Eden of
   delicate corals arrayed in fans, she saw mud, stubby spires and squat
   boulder corals. Snails and clams were mostly gone, as were most of a
   reef's usual residents: worms, colorful sea squirts and ornate
   feather stars.

   The culprit: excess carbon dioxide. When CO[2] hits seawater it becomes
   carbonic acid -- the same weak acid found in club soda -- and releases
   hydrogen ions, reducing the water's pH. This chemical change robs the
   water of carbonate ions, a critical building block for many marine
   organisms. Clams rely on that carbonate, as do corals, lobsters,
   shrimp, crabs, barnacles, sand dollars, cucumbers and sea urchins.

   In Puget Sound, for example, 30 percent of marine life -- some 600
   species -- draws upon carbonate ions to grow.

   Reaction to high CO[2] varies by species. Acidification can kill
   [29]baby abalone and some [30]crabs, deform [31]squid and weaken
   [32]brittle stars while making it tough for [33]corals to grow. It can
   increase sea grasses, which can be good, and boost the toxicity of
   [34]red tides, which is not. It makes many creatures less resilient to
   [35]heavy metal pollution.

   Roughly a quarter of organisms studied by researchers actually do
   better in high CO[2]. Another quarter seem unaffected. But entire
   marine systems are built around the remaining half of susceptible
   plants and animals.

   "What does well in disturbed environments are invasive generalists,"
   said Ken Caldeira, a climate expert at Stanford's Carnegie Institution
   for Science, who helped popularize the term ocean acidification. "The
   ones that do poorly are the more highly evolved specialists. Yes, there
   will be winners and losers, but the winners will mostly be the weeds."

   Many species, from [36]sea urchins to abalone, have some capacity to
   adapt to high CO[2]. But it's not clear if they will have the time.

     "What can I, as an individual with no money nor power, do to help
     stop this? I can reduce my energy use as far as possible. Apart from
     the online stuff I'm pretty low CO[2]. I can reduce, reuse, and
     recycle. (I need to get better at that.) But what else can I do?"

   "It's almost like an arms race," said Gretchen Hofmann, a marine
   biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "We can see
   that the potential for rapid evolution is there. The question is, will
   the changes be so rapid and extreme that it will outstrip what they're
   capable of?"

   That is the underlying problem: The pace of change has caught everyone
   off guard.

   Already, the oceans have grown 30 percent more acidic since the dawn of
   the industrial revolution -- 15 percent just since the 1990s. By the
   end of this century, scientists predict, seas may be 150 percent more
   acidic than they were in the 18th century.

   The oceans are corroding faster than they did during [40]past periods
   of marine extinctions that were linked to souring seas. Even 55 million
   years ago, the rate of change was [41]10 times slower than today. The
   current shift has come so quickly that scientists five years ago
   [42]saw chemical changes off the West Coast not expected for half
   a century.

   And the seas are souring even faster in some places.

   The Arctic and Antarctic have shifted more rapidly than other waters
   around the world because deep, cold seas absorb more CO[2]. The U.S.
   West Coast has simply seen consequences sooner because strong winds
   draw its CO[2]-rich water to the surface where vulnerable
   shellfish live.

   A worker harvests oysters from the Nisbet family's Goose Point Oyster
   Co. in Willapa Bay. After ocean acidification started killing billions
   of baby oysters along Washington's coast, both in the wild and in
   hatcheries where the Nisbets bought their oyster seed, the family took
   a radical step. They opened a hatchery in Hawaii. [43]View photo
   gallery ->

   Sea chemistry in the Northwest already is so bad during some windy
   periods that it kills young oysters in Washington's Willapa Bay. In
   less than 40 years, half the West Coast's surface waters [44]are
   expected to be that corrosive every day.

   That threatens to reduce the variety of life in the sea.

   "That loss of biodiversity should matter to people just like a lack of
   diversity in your stock portfolio should bother people," said Jeremy
   Mathis, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration. "It works exactly the same way. If you go all-in on one
   stock and that stock crashes, you're stuck."

   Katharina Fabricius sees plenty of reason to worry.

   In six trips to Papua New Guinea, she found sea cucumbers and urchins
   living near the vents, but the shrimp and crab she expected to see
   instead [45]were almost nonexistent. She saw only 60 percent as many
   hard corals as she did on healthy reefs nearby. Only 8 percent as many
   soft corals survived, and one species dominated. The reefs that
   remained were less intricate, offering fewer places for animals to
   hide. Dull, rounded boulder corals, which seemed to thrive, still grew
   a third slower than normal. Sea grasses flourished but were less
   diverse. There was twice as much fleshy algae.
   [75b52a8e06ff3574bf9c6da0ec9ba85f.jpg]

   Biologists Sam Noonan, left, and Miwa Takahashi collect sea grass in
   Papua New Guinea. Sea grasses, which are expected to increase as the
   ocean becomes more acidic, grow far faster near the CO[2] vents.

   "We're seeing sea-grass meadows as green as golf lawns," Fabricius
   said. "But corals are suffering, and they are incredibly important."

   Corals protect shorelines from erosion and severe weather and provide a
   dormitory where staggering varieties of life seek shelter. Those tiny
   plants and animals then become food for other creatures. Study after
   study shows the same thing -- the more reefs collapse and fleshy algae
   spreads, the less we see of important tropical fish: wrasses, tangs,
   damselfish, parrotfish.

   Those losses come at a price.

   One-sixth of animal protein consumed by humans comes from marine fish
   -- in some cultures nearly all of it. The vast majority of wild seafood
   is fish, and fish account for three-quarters of the money made from
   ocean catches.

   Yet reefs are just the first of many ways ocean-chemistry shifts could
   hit seafood.

   Scientists once thought fish would dodge the worst direct effects of
   acidification. Now it appears that might be wrong -- a fact researchers
   learned almost by accident.

Losing Nemo: Fish harmed, with deadly results

   In 2007, American biologist Danielle Dixson arrived in Papua New Guinea
   hoping to find out how Nemo got home.

   Clownfish live in waggling anemones near coral reefs, often near
   islands. Scientists suspected they traced their way through the sea by
   following their noses. But how?
   [536cb9761a54557997d20116976e89c1.jpg]

   Clownfish swim through an anemone near Dobu Island, Papua New Guinea.
   CO[2] can alter how clownfish see, hear and smell, which increases the
   chance of death.

   Solving this riddle would help uncover one of acidification's most
   haunting problems: its ability to scramble fish behavior.

   Dixson, then a graduate student at Australia's James Cook University,
   wanted to find the olfactory cue that drew clownfish back to the reef.
   She tested smells from different water. She tested dirt. Nothing was
   quite right, until she looked up.
   [aed7294e9d1497588a39733a3c2fdc2f.jpg]

   Biologist Jodie Rummer dissects a fish she caught at one of the
   carbon-dioxide vent sites off Papua New Guinea as part of her effort to
   understand how or if chemically altered water affects fish.

   Since Papua New Guinea's island rain forests drape over the sea, Dixson
   took five island plants and spread the scent of their leaves in water.
   Young clownfish immediately swam toward the smell.

   Back in Australia, she prepared to repeat the experiment in a lab.
   There she bumped into Philip Munday.

   Munday, a James Cook University professor, had been trying to see if
   carbon dioxide hurts fish. He checked everything: weight, survival,
   reproduction. No obvious problems surfaced, which came as no surprise.
   Fish are excellent at altering blood chemistry to accommodate
   changing seas.

   But he wanted to do more tests. He asked Dixson if she minded raising
   some extra clownfish for him.

   On a whim they decided: Why not see if CO[2] altered how fish use
   their noses?

   "We thought, `let's just combine the two experiments and see how it
   goes,' not expecting that we'd see anything," Munday said.

CO[2]-rich seas can scramble fish behavior

   High levels of CO[2] can alter a fish's sense of smell, hearing and
   sight -- even its decision-making. That leads young tropical reef fish
   to die more often. Here's what happens.
   CO<sub>2</sub>-rich seas can scramble fish behavior

   Mark Nowlin / The Seattle Times

   Surprises came right away. Exposed to high CO[2], the fish quit
   distinguishing between odors and were equally attracted to every scent.
   Since clownfish use smell to stay safe, the duo then exposed babies in
   high-CO[2] water to dottybacks and rock cod -- bigger fish that eat
   young clownfish.

   Normal clownfish always avoided the danger. The exposed fish lost all
   fear. They swam straight at predators.

   Over the next few years, scientists learned CO[2] changed many reef
   fishes' senses and behaviors: sight, hearing, the propensity to turn
   left or right. Baby reef fish exposed to high CO[2] and placed back in
   the wild [46]died five times more often. Even when baby reef fish and
   predators were both exposed to high CO[2], young fish were bolder,
   ventured farther from home -- and died twice as often.

   Only last year did researchers learn why: Elevated CO[2] disrupts brain
   signaling in a manner common among many fish.

   The clownfish story, in other words, was no longer just
   about clownfish.

   By then, another American living in Australia, marine scientist Jodie
   Rummer, was learning that high CO[2] [47]boosted aerobic capacity for
   some tropical fish, transforming them into super athletes. Yet even
   some of these fish showed behavioral problems. Rummer called it "dumb
   jock syndrome."

   "You might expect that a more athletic fish can be better at chasing
   food, or be better at getting away from a predator, or finding a mate,"
   she said. "But if their cognitive function -- or their brain -- is
   compromised under these high-CO[2] conditions, they might make bad
   choices. They might turn the wrong direction and end up right in a
   predator's mouth."

   Most of this research had been limited to a select few tropical
   species. But scientists knew it wouldn't take much for behavioral
   problems to impact consumers.

   Acidification need only harm the wrong fish.

Big warning for high-stakes fishery

   [e13781edcf053677cf7caedc3958eb66.jpg]

   Walleye pollock show some behavioral problems similar to those found in
   clownfish when exposed to high levels of CO[2]. That raises concern
   about the North Pacific's $1 billion-a-year pollock fishery, which
   accounts for half the nation's catch of fish.

   Across the Pacific Ocean from Papua New Guinea, Tom Enlow climbed a set
   of stairs in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, a thousand miles out in the Aleutian
   Islands chain. He arrived on the sorting line of a fish-processing
   plant owned by Redmond-based UniSea.

   Behind Enlow, giant vacuum hoses spit thousands of oily walleye pollock
   onto a conveyor.

   Pollock "is the lifeblood of our local economy, certainly, and the
   state's economy, and one of the largest industries on the Northwest and
   West Coast," said Enlow, the plant's manager.

   The North Pacific pollock catch is so big it sounds almost absurd.
   Fleets of fishermen and factory trawlers haul in 3 billion pounds
   annually. No other North American fishery operates on this scale.
   Seafood companies reel in $1 billion a year from that catch.

   Pollock gets carved into frozen fish sticks, sold overseas as roe and
   imitation crab, or packed in blocks. McDonald's runs television
   commercials trumpeting the Bering Sea fishermen who supply pollock for
   Filet-O-Fish sandwiches.

   So pollock was among the first species the U.S. government tested in
   high-CO[2] water. Results late last year brought no surprise:
   Acidification would hurt neither the fish's body nor its growth. Adult
   and young seemed physically unharmed.

   But after tracking clownfish research, government scientists in Oregon
   tried new tests.

   After smelling prey, pollock scout around and hunt it down. So NOAA
   biologist Thomas Hurst exposed young pollock to high CO[2] and
   introduced the scent of what they eat. Some of the fish struggled
   [48]to recognize their food.

   "In some of the very early work it looks like pollock may show some of
   the same kinds of deficits that are seen in coral-reef fishes,"
   Hurst said.

   It's too soon to say how -- or even if -- that would affect pollock
   fishing. Some tropical fish raised in high-CO[2] water gave birth to
   young that adjusted to their new environment. Pollock might respond the
   same way.

   But the fish also might not. And a lot rides on the outcome,
   particularly in the Northwest.

   Dutch Harbor might as well be a distant Seattle suburb. Washington
   businesses or residents often own or run its trawlers, crab boats and
   processors. Employees typically come from the Puget Sound region. Even
   the former five-term mayor of Unalaska, Dutch Harbor's municipal
   government, used to fish out of Ballard.

   "We don't yet know whether it's going to be a really severe impact or a
   modest impact," Hurst said. But "if the fish is less able to recognize
   the scent of its prey and then therefore locate food when it's foraging
   out in the wild, obviously that's going to have negative impacts for
   growth and then survival in the long run."

   And that's just one species. Similar tests are under way for rockfish,
   cod, several kinds of crab and sharks.

   But brain damage is not even the biggest threat to commercial fish.
   [88707423ec71a999aef77a6fd1c1f1ff.jpg]

   This pteropod, also known as a sea butterfly, comes from Puget Sound.
   The tiny shelled creatures are an important food source for many fish
   and seabirds. The shells of pteropods already are eroding in
   Antarctica, where the water chemistry isn't as bad as it is in parts of
   the Pacific Northwest.

Key link in food chain dissolving

   All over the ocean, usually too small to see, flutter beautiful, nearly
   see-through creatures called pteropods, also known as sea butterflies.
   Scientists have known for years that plummeting ocean pH eventually
   would begin to burn through their shells.

   Few people would find that significant save for one fact: Many things
   eat pteropods.

   Birds, fish and mammals, from pollock to whales, feast on this abundant
   ocean snack. Pteropods make up half the diet of baby pink salmon and
   get eaten by other fish, such as herring, that then get swallowed by
   larger animals.

   So scientists [50]were alarmed late in 2012 when researchers announced
   that pteropods in Antarctica were dissolving right now in waters less
   corrosive than those often found off Washington and Oregon. What did
   that mean for the Northwest?
   [844e33c37ce2155525ef3d9bcf64945e.jpg]

   Pink salmon swim through Finch Creek, near a salmon hatchery on Hood
   Canal. Pteropods make up roughly half the diet of young pink
   salmon in Alaska.

   The United States does so little monitoring of marine systems that we
   know almost nothing about the health of creatures that form the bottom
   of the ocean food chain -- things like pteropods, krill or other
   important zooplankton called copepods. The most-studied animals remain
   those we catch. Little is known about the things they eat.

   Computer modelers such as Isaac Kaplan, at NOAA in Seattle, are
   scrambling to figure out how sea-chemistry changes could reverberate
   through the ocean.

   Initial results are disturbing.

   "Right now, for acidification in particular," Kaplan said, "the risks
   look pretty substantial."

   Kaplan tracks the Pacific coast -- temperature, pH levels, currents,
   salinity. He incorporates studies that detail how CO[2] impacts
   creatures. Then he extrapolates how all those variables are likely to
   affect the fish people catch.

   While the models are rough and uncertainty is high -- too many elements
   cannot be controlled -- the trend is clear.

   Kaplan's early work predicts significant declines in sharks, skates and
   rays, some types of [52]flounder and sole, and Pacific whiting, also
   known as hake, the most frequently caught commercial fish off the coast
   of Washington, Oregon and California.

   "Some species will go up, some species will go down," said Phil Levin,
   ecosystems leader for NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center in
   Seattle. "On balance, it looks to us like most of the commercially
   caught fish species will go down."

Fearing `a mess for this little town'

   The findings confound those who rely on commercial fish.

   Capt. Ben Downs stood atop the wheelhouse of the F/V Pacific Dove, in
   Westport, Grays Harbor County, on a recent summer day as he rolled on a
   fresh coat of whitewash. Downs spent years piloting one of the coast's
   biggest whiting boats. This day he was prepping for shrimp fishing.

     "The early warnings are there. We've seen the first wave that hit
     the oysters. We're just hoping it doesn't come our way."

     Dave Fraser

     Who runs a hake fishing cooperative

   "The ocean is always changing," Downs said. Nearby a ship offloaded
   whiting at the city's largest processor. "This is nothing different.
   I've battled the ocean all my life."

   Yet even a skeptic like Downs sees the stakes.

   Coastwide, fishermen bring in tens of million pounds of whiting a year.
   It's the biggest product at Westport's fish plant, which at times
   employs a quarter of the city's workforce.

   "If the hake went away, it'd be a mess for this little town," he said.
   "Astoria, Oregon, same thing. Newport, Oregon, same thing."

   Dave Fraser, who runs a whiting fishing cooperative, wasn't skeptical,
   but weary. Fishermen already face tangible crises daily: the dollar's
   value swinging wildly against the yen; quotas falling based on routine
   marine shifts.

   "Being able to focus on something 10 or 20 years away ... it's hard,"
   he said. "The early warnings are there. We've seen the first wave that
   hit the oysters. We're just hoping it doesn't come our way."

   It is a problem not limited to fishing fleets.

   "If you go 100 miles from the coast, most people say, `Why do I care
   about ocean acidification?' " Mathis, at NOAA, said. "Convincing a
   farmer in Iowa or a teacher in Kansas to care about ocean acidification
   is our challenge."

   He measures progress by the drop in emails from angry Alaskans
   challenging his findings.

   "Acidification is very real: There isn't any doubt it's happening,"
   said Clem Tillion, a former Republican Alaska state Senate president,
   even though he still denies human contributions to global warming.
   "It's obvious. And it's going to be devastating."

At stake: food for rural people

   On a warm Papua New Guinea night, a quarter-mile from Fabricius' CO[2]
   vents, Edwin Morioga and Ridley Guma sat in the dark in a canoe and
   prepped their spears.
   [6f6507b8c97e7c44b61e1ffd70e7e24f.jpg]

   Ridley Guma and Edwin Morioga dive at night using spears and
   flashlights to catch reef fish off Normanby Island, Papua New Guinea.

   The rain-forest jungles of Milne Bay are home to wallabies, flying
   rodents, cockatoos and butterflies the size of dinner plates. Villagers
   raise taro, yams and other vegetables. Many know increasing storms and
   rising seas someday will force them to move their sago tree huts to
   higher ground.

   But with a quarter of a million people spread across 600 islands, the
   threat to food may be more significant.

   Most of their protein comes from the sea. Fishermen unspool hand lines
   to collect sweetlips and sea perch. They gather shrimp and crustaceans.
   And at night they dodge tiger sharks and saltwater crocodiles to spear
   small fish from beneath bountiful corals.

   Globally, the sea provides the primary source of animal protein for a
   billion people. Many, like Morioga and Guma, have few alternatives.

   The pair slipped into the water and floated face down, flashlights
   trained on the reef. Neither knew much about Fabricius' acidification
   research. But they agreed they did not want CO[2] from the West or an
   industrializing Asia transforming their reefs into places resembling
   the desolate nearby bubble sites.

   Away from the vents, amid the coral, life of all kinds is
   still plentiful.

   In an instant, Morioga saw a flash. He took a breath and dived,
   stabbing beneath a branching coral. After a pause, Morioga surfaced.

   On the end of his spear writhed a tiny rabbitfish, his first catch of
   the night from what remains one of the world's healthiest reefs.

   At least for now.

Changes come decades faster than expected

   Less than a decade ago, scientists expected acidification wouldn't harm
   marine life until late in the 21st century. In the past five years,
   researchers instead have figured out it's happening now. Here is a
   timeline of what we thought we knew -- and how that changed.

   Early 20th century

   Scientists begin to understand how carbon moves between the atmosphere
   and the sea.

   [purplecoral2.png]

   1999

   A handful of scientists [54]predict rising CO[2] emissions may change
   sea chemistry enough [55]to harm corals by late in the 21st century.

   2003

   Atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira predicts sea chemistry [56]will
   change more rapidly over the next century than it has in tens of
   millions of years.

   2006

   Seattle oceanographer Richard Feely, with the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and others discover North Pacific
   sea chemistry [57]has changed dramatically just since they sampled it
   in 1991.

   Top ocean researchers release [58]first major ocean-acidification
   report and brief Congress, highlighting marine changes they fear are
   possible by century's end.

   [Coral.png]

   2007

   Feely and colleagues take an ocean research trip between Canada and
   Mexico and find enormous stretches of seawater already changing in ways
   [59]not expected for 50 to 100 years. Because of ocean currents,
   weather and geography, they figure out, West Coast sea chemistry --
   unlike oceans at large -- will worsen for decades even if fossil-fuel
   emissions are cut.

   2008

   Scientists suspect sea-chemistry changes are [60]killing oyster larvae
   in the Northwest, which would mean acidification is harming marine life
   at least a half-century sooner than expected.

   Scientists predict tiny shelled pteropods, an important food for fish,
   birds and whales, will begin dissolving in Antarctica [61]between 2030
   and 2038.

   2009

   Oceanographer Jeremy Mathis finds the chemistry of water in the Gulf of
   Alaska [62]changing more drastically than models projected.

   2011

   Mathis discovers CO[2] levels in the Bering Sea [63]are amplified by
   melting sea ice. That exposes more ocean surface to fossil-fuel
   emissions and lets in sunlight, which allows plankton to bloom and die,
   boosting carbon dioxide even more. The pH of broad stretches of the
   North Pacific is now so low several months of the year that some
   animals already may struggle to grow shells.

   2012

   Scientists [64]say they're certain ocean acidification is killing
   Northwest oysters.

   Computer models based on new data project that the acidified water that
   occasionally kills Northwest oysters will be [65]common every day on
   half the U.S. West Coast in less than 40 years.

   Scientist Nina Bednarsek finds pteropods in Antarctica [66]already
   dissolving.

   2013

   [red-king-crab.png]

   Researchers show baby king crab [67]die in high numbers when exposed to
   CO[2]-rich waters expected later this century. Mathis finds North
   Pacific sea chemistry at certain times of the year [68]already is that
   bad.
