Stand with the Aurora, Colorado Shooting Victims and Their Families

   By Mayors Against Illegal Guns ([15]Contact)

   To be delivered to: Political Leaders
   Petition Statement
   Join me in standing with the victims and families of the Aurora,
   Colorado shooting and pledge to end gun violence.

Petition Background

   It's happening again. A tragic gun violence massacre is sending
   shockwaves across our nation. And our hearts go out to the victims of
   another senseless act by a killer armed to the teeth with dangerous
   weapons.
   Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson and now Aurora. The list of mass gun
   tragedies grows longer and, every day in America, gun violence claims
   dozens of victims.
   When they express their concern and condolences, America's political
   leaders speak for all of us. But when they fail to back up those
   high-minded sentiments with action to end the violence, their kind
   words begin to ring hollow.
   Please join people all across our nation in demanding action from our
   leaders and in personally pledging to keep pressing until America takes
   concrete action to end the violence.
