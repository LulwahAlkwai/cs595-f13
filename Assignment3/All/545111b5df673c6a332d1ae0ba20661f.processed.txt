Bill Nye the Science Guy Joins Bill Maher

   By [50]Jacob Klein [51][Author-Posts.png] | HBO Series: [52]Real Time
   with Bill Maher | Sep 11, 2013

   Neil head on Bill shoulder 23

   REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER returns from hiatus and resumes its 11th
   season FRIDAY, SEPT. 13 (10:00-11:00 p.m. live ET/tape-delayed PT),
   with a replay at 11:00 p.m., exclusively on HBO. Allowing Maher to
   offer his unique perspective on contemporary issues, the show includes
   an opening monologue, roundtable discussions with panelists, and
   interviews with in-studio and satellite guests. Emmy® winning scientist
   Bill Nye is the mid-show interview guest. The roundtable guests are
   economist Zanny Minton-Beddoes, former Lt. Governor Michael Steele and
   editor Matt Taibbi. The top-of-show interview guest will be announced
   when confirmed.

   HBOWatch: Well, I'm betting [53]/r/atheism and [54]/r/science are
   equally happy today. Bill Nye is a god amongst men in certain circles
   and we can't wait to hear what he has to say on the issues of the day.
   [55]Neil Degrasse Tyson is also a fan favorite scientist and friend of
   Real Time. His [56]previous appearances were very entertaining as he
   spoke truth to stupid. Let's hope Mr. Nye can do the same.

   We've all been eager to hear Bill's thoughts on Syria and the other
   issues that have arisen since his break started this summer. Tune in
   this Friday for all the goods.

   We'll update this post when we know who the top of the show guest is.

       Dang it. I don't have HBO.

            Real Time is available as a podcast at
            [57]http://www.hbo.com/podcasts/billmaher/podcast.xml It's
            audio only (except for his "New Rules" bits which get released
            individually, but I've found that it's usually good enough to
            get most of the show.

       I would love to watch, but I cannot afford HBO.

            If you've got a friend of family member with HBO hang out at
            their house on Friday night! Or it will be on HBOGo at the
            same time if you can borrow their login. IT'S FOR SCIENCE,
            MAN!
