   Investigators believe Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist, was the
   lone gunman in the shooting spree at the [71]Navy Yard in Washington
   D.C. earlier today in which 12 people were killed before the suspect
   was killed in a firefight with police, and authorities have lifted a
   shelter in place for the remaining residents in the area.

   The 12 deceased shooting victims range in age from 46 to 73 years old,
   Washington D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray said at an evening news conference.
   Officials are still notifying the families of about half of the 12
   people who were killed, he said.

   "We have no evidence that any active military are amongst the victims,"
   Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier said.

   Officials said three others suffered gunshot wounds and five more
   people suffered other injuries.

   Police identified the seven victims whose families had been notified
   as: Michael Arnold, 59; Sylvia Fraiser, 53; Kathy Gaarde, 62; John
   Roger Johnson, 73; Frank Kohler, 50; Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46; and
   Vishnu Pandit, 61.

   The death of Alexis, 34, of Fort Worth, Texas, brought the toll of the
   carnage at the Navy Sea Systems Command headquarters to 13. The
   shooter's identity was confirmed based on a partial finger print
   analysis, authorities said.

   The suspect had a security clearance that allowed him onto the Navy
   Yard as part of his civilian subcontracting work, officials said.

   Aaron Alexis, deceased, is believed to be responsible for the shootings
   at the Washington Navy Yard, in the Southeast area of Washington, DC,
   around 8:20 a.m. on Sept. 16, 2013. The FBI is asking for the public's
   assistance with any information regarding Alexis.

   Alexis and members of the subcontracting team, according to law
   enforcement sources, were staying at a Residence Inn about a mile from
   the Navy Yard. The suspect's car was found on the Washington Navy Yard,
   law enforcement sources said.

   A senior law enforcement official said he used his security clearance
   to get on campus and it appeared he did not force his way onto the
   property. Officials were in the process of getting a search warrant to
   search the vehicle, which was described as a rental car.

   Authorities had earlier said they were searching for a possible second
   suspect, but officials said at the evening news conference said the
   search for a black suspect in olive-drab uniform age 40 to 50 has been
   exhausted.

   Earlier today, Lanier praised the works by police officers who
   responded to the incident.

   "I think the actions by the police officers, without question, helped
   to reduce the number of lives lost," she said.

   Lanier said police and the suspect exchanged gunfire "multiple times"
   before he was shot and killed in a final gunbattle.

   Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington
   D.C. field office, said investigators were trying to learn everything
   they can about Alexis.

   "No piece of information is too small," Parlave said.

   She asked anyone with information about his recent movements, contacts
   and associates to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI.

   Another man who was sought for a possible connection to the shooting
   was located this afternoon and was no longer a "suspect or person of
   interest," according to a tweet from the Metropolitan Police
   Department.

   Lanier declined to discuss what evidence led police to believe the
   massacre could have potentially been carried out by more than one
   person.

   "We have reason to believe these people may be involved and we want to
   talk to them," Lanier said at an afternoon news conference. She said
   there was "no known motive" for the massacre.

   Among the [75]wounded was a law enforcement officer who was shot in an
   exchange with the gunman.

   The shooting brought parts of Washington D.C. to a standstill.

   The Washington Nationals, whose stadium is a couple blocks away from
   the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters, said the team's game
   tonight against the Atlanta Braves was postponed until Tuesday.

   The Senate complex was placed under a temporary lockdown this afternoon
   "in light of the uncertainty surrounding the shooting" and the
   possibliity that a second shooter might have been at large, Senate
   Sergeant at Arms Terrance W. Gainer wrote in a note to the Senate
   community.

   At nearby Reagan National Airport this morning, a ground stop was
   imposed by the FAA. All planes have since resumed flying out of the
   airport, a Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority spokeswoman told
   ABC News.

   Nine D.C. public schools were placed on lockdowns this morning,
   according to the District of Columbia Public Schools' Twitter account,
   but all schools were dismissed as scheduled this afternoon.

   Washington D.C. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton told reporters the district
   has not "had a day like this since 9/11."

   President Obama ordered the flags at all federal and military
   installations to be flown at half-staff through Friday in honor of the
   victims.

   At the beginning of a news conference today, Obama said he was briefed
   on the shooting.

   "We are confronting yet another mass shooting, and today it happened on
   a military installation in our nation's capital," he said.

   Obama said he wanted a "seamless" investigation into the shooting and
   was standing with the victims and their families affected by what he
   called a "cowardly act."

   "It targeted our military and civilian personnel, men and women who
   were going to work, doing their job protecting all of us. They are
   patriots and they know the dangers of serving abroad," Obama said. "But
   today they faced the unimaginable violence that they won't have
   expected here at home."

   Two Officers Among the Injured

   Two law enforcement officers were among the injured when the suspect
   fired shots inside the 3,000-person building at 8:20 a.m. Law
   enforcement officials initially told personnel to evacuate the building
   but they were later told to shelter in place.

   A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
   sent a team of special agents to help secure the scene. This is the
   same team that helped apprehend Boston Marathon bombing suspect
   Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, according to the spokesman.

   Three gunshot victims were taken to Washington Medical Center with
   "severe injuries," according to Janis Orlowski, chief medical officer
   at the hospital.

   The victims were described as a male Metropolitan police officer who
   had "multiple gunshot wounds to his legs," a woman who was shot in the
   head and the hand and another woman who was shot in the shoulder.

   Orlowski said all three were in critical condition, however they were
   conscious and were expected to survive.
