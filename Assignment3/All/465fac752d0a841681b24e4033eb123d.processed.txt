How the internet is making us poor

   By [101]Christopher Mims -- March 27, 2013

   Everyone knows the story of how [102]robots replaced humans on the
   factory floor. But in the broader sweep of automation versus labor, a
   trend with far greater significance for the middle class--in rich
   countries, at any rate--has been relatively overlooked: the replacement
   of knowledge workers with software.

   One reason for the neglect is that this trend is at most thirty years
   old, and has become apparent in economic data only in perhaps the past
   ten years. The first all-in-one commercial microprocessor went on sale
   [103]in 1971, and like all inventions, it took decades for it to become
   an ecosystem of technologies pervasive and powerful enough to have a
   measurable impact on the way we work.

   This feature is Part II in a series on the rise of the machines. You
   can read Part I, on the usurpation by robots of the last of the world's
   unskilled manufacturing jobs, [104]here.

"Software is eating the world"

   Marc Andreessen is funding the companies making the software disrupting
   labor markets the world over. AP/Paul Sakuma

   Sixty percent of the jobs in the US are information-processing jobs,
   notes Erik Brynjolfsson, co-author of a recent book about this
   disruption, [105]Race Against the Machine. It's safe to assume that
   almost all of these jobs are aided by machines that perform routine
   tasks. These machines make some workers more productive. They make
   others less essential.

   The turn of the new millennium is when the automation of middle-class
   information processing tasks really got under way, according to [106]an
   analysis by the Associated Press based on data from the Bureau of Labor
   Statistics. Between 2000 and 2010, the jobs of 1.1 million secretaries
   were eliminated, replaced by internet services that made everything
   from maintaining a calendar to planning trips easier than ever. In the
   same period, the number of telephone operators dropped by 64%, travel
   agents by 46% and bookkeepers by 26%. And the US was not a special
   case. As the AP notes, "Two-thirds of the 7.6 million middle-class jobs
   that vanished in Europe were the victims of technology, estimates
   economist Maarten Goos at Belgium's University of Leuven."

   Economist Andrew McAfee, Brynjolfsson's co-author, has called these
   displaced people "[107]routine cognitive workers." Technology, he says,
   is now smart enough to automate their often repetitive, programmatic
   tasks. "We are in a desperate, serious competition with these
   machines," concurs Larry Kotlikoff, a professor of economics at Boston
   University. "It seems like the machines are taking over all possible
   jobs."

   Like farming and factory work before it, the labors of the mind are
   being colonized by devices and systems. In the early 1800's, nine out
   of ten Americans worked in agriculture--now it's around 2%. At its
   peak, about a third of the US population was employed in
   manufacturing--now it's less than 10%. How many decades until the
   figures are similar for the information-processing tasks that typify
   rich countries' post-industrial economies?

   Web pioneer and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen describes this
   process as "software is eating the world." As he [108]wrote in an
   editorial (paywall) for the Wall Street Journal, "More and more major
   businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as
   online services--from movies to agriculture to national defense."

The hollowing out of the middle class

   To see how the internet has disproportionately affected the jobs of
   people who process information, check out the gray bars dipping below
   the 0% line on the chart, below. (I've adapted this chart to show just
   the types of employment that lost jobs in the US during the great
   recession. Every other category [109]continued to add jobs or was
   nearly flat.)
   People who process information are losing their jobs at rates
   comparable to the rate of loss in manufacturing. St. Louis Fed

   What's apparent is that the same trend seen in making and processing
   things--represented by the "Production..." and "Operators..."
   categories--shows up for the routine cognitive workers in offices and,
   for related if not identical reasons, sales.

   Here's another clue about what's been going on in the past ten years.
   "Return on capital" measures the return firms get when they spend money
   on capital goods like robots, factories, software--anything aside from
   people. (If this were a graph of return on people hired, it would be
   called "Return on labor".)
   Not surprisingly, information processing tasks benefit as much from the
   application of capital--including information technology--as
   manufacturing does. St. Louis Fed

   Notice: the only industry where the return on capital is as great as
   manufacturing is "other industries"--a grab bag which includes all the
   service and information industries, as well as entertainment, health
   care and education. In short, you don't have to be a tech company for
   investing in technology to be worthwhile.

Companies that invest in IT do better

   Here's yet a third clue about what's going on. For many years, the
   question of whether or not spending on information technology (IT) made
   companies more productive was [110]highly controversial. [111]Many
   studies found that IT spending either had no effect on productivity or
   was even counter-productive. But now a clear trend is emerging. More
   recent studies show that IT--and the organizational changes that go
   with it--are doing firms, [112]especially multinationals (pdf), a great
   deal of good.

   One reason for the delay is that it has taken some time for companies
   to learn how best to use IT. Economist Carlota Perez calls this the
   "[113]installation phase." Moreover, the more recent rise of the
   internet has multiplied the power that IT has on its own.

   In any case, if computers are the factory floor for routine cognitive
   workers, then when software and the internet makes some workers more
   productive, others are no longer needed.

Winner-take-all and the power of capital to exacerbate inequality

   "Skill-biased technical change" is a fancy phrase for "Google engineers
   are richly rewarded for their talents." AP Photo/Mary Altaffer

   One thing all our machines have accomplished, and especially the
   internet, is the ability to reproduce and distribute good work in
   record time. Barring market distortions like monopolies, the best
   software, media, business processes and, increasingly, hardware, can be
   copied and sold seemingly everywhere at once. This benefits
   "superstars"--the most skilled engineers or content creators. And it
   benefits the consumer, who can expect a higher average quality of
   goods.

   But it can also exacerbate income inequality, says Brynjolfsson. This
   contributes to a phenomenon called "skill-biased technological [or
   technical] change." "The idea is that technology in the past 30 years
   has tended to favor more skilled and educated workers versus less
   educated workers," says Brynjolfsson. "It has been a complement for
   more skilled workers. It makes their labor more valuable. But for less
   skilled workers, it makes them less necessary--especially those who do
   routine, repetitive tasks."

   The result is that, with the aid of machines, productivity
   increases--the overall economic pie gets bigger--but that's small
   consolation if all but a few workers are getting a smaller slice.
   "Certainly the labor market has never been better for very
   highly-educated workers in the United States, and when I say never, I
   mean never," MIT labor economist David Autor [114]told American Public
   Media's Marketplace.

   The other winners in this scenario are anyone who owns capital. Only
   about half of Americans own stock at all, and as more companies are
   taken private or never go public, more and more of that wealth is
   concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people. As [115]Paul
   Krugman wrote, "This is an old concern in economics; it's
   "capital-biased technological change", which tends to shift the
   distribution of income away from workers to the owners of capital."

Unlike other technological revolutions, computers are everywhere

   The ubiquity of smartphones in rich countries is just the tip of the
   silicon iceberg. Computers are more disruptive than, say, the looms
   smashed by the Luddites, because they are "general-purpose
   technologies" [116]noted Peter Linert, an economist at University of
   Californa-Davis. Sensors, embedded systems, internet-connected devices,
   and an ever-expanding pool of cloud computing resources are all being
   put to the same use: how to figure out, in the most efficient way
   possible, what to do next.

   "The spread of computers and the Internet will put jobs in two
   categories," [117]said Andreessen. "People who tell computers what to
   do, and people who are told by computers what to do." It's a glib
   remark--but increasingly true.

   In a gleaming new warehouse in the old market town of Rugley, England,
   [118]Amazon directs the actions of hundreds of "associates" wielding
   hand-held computers. These computers tell workers not only which shelf
   to walk to when they're pulling goods to be shipped, but also the
   optimal route by which to get there. Each person's performance is
   monitored, and they are given constant feedback about whether or not
   they are performing their job quickly enough. Their bosses can even
   send them text messages via their handheld computers, urging them to
   speed up. "You're sort of like a robot, but in human form," one manager
   at Amazon's warehouse [119]told the Financial Times. "It's human
   automation, if you like."

   And yet despite this already high level of automation, Amazon is
   already working on how to eliminate the humans in its warehouses all
   together. In March 2009, Amazon [120]acquired Kiva Systems, a warehouse
   robotics and automation company. In partnership with a company called
   Quiet Logistics, Kiva's combination of mobile shelving and robots has
   already [121]automated a warehouse in Andover, Massachusetts. Here's a
   video showing how Kiva's robots, which look like oversize Roombas, can
   store, retrieve and sort goods with minimal involvement from humans.

This time it's faster

   History is littered with technological transitions. Many of them seemed
   at the time to threaten mass unemployment of one type of worker or
   another, whether it was buggy whip makers or, more recently, travel
   agents. But here's what's different about information-processing jobs:
   The takeover by technology is happening much faster.

   From 2000 to 2007, in the years leading up to the great recession, GDP
   and productivity in the US grew faster [123]than at any point since the
   1960s, but job creation did not keep pace. Brynjolfsson thinks he knows
   why: More and more people were doing work aided by software. And during
   the great recession, employment growth didn't just slow. As we saw
   above, in both manufacturing and information processing, the economy
   shed jobs, even as employment in the service sector and professional
   fields remained flat.

   Especially in the past ten years, economists have seen a reversal of
   what they call "[124]the great compression"--that period from the
   second world war through the 1970s when, in the US at least, more
   people were crowded into the ranks of the middle class than ever
   before. There are many reasons why the economy has reversed this
   "compression," transforming into an "[125]hourglass economy" with many
   fewer workers in the middle class and more at either the high or the
   low end of the income spectrum. But whatever those forces, they are
   clearly being exacerbated by technological change.

   The hourglass represents an income distribution that has been more
   nearly the norm for most of the history of the US. That it's coming
   back should worry anyone who believes that a healthy middle class is an
   inevitable outcome of economic progress, a mainstay of democracy and a
   healthy society, or a driver of further economic development. Indeed,
   [126]some have argued that as technology aids the gutting of the middle
   class, it destroys the very market required to sustain it--that we'll
   see "less of the type of innovation we associate with Steve Jobs, and
   more of the type you would find at Goldman Sachs."

Is any job safe?

   Recently I sat down with the team at [127]Betterment, a tech startup to
   which people have already handed over $150 million in assets. For many,
   that money represents a significant chunk of their savings and
   retirement accounts. Betterment is the sort of company that, if it does
   well, will someday be a canonical example of the principle that
   "software eats everything." It's an attempt replace the kind of job you
   might think is still beyond the reach of an algorithm: personal
   financial advice.

   The legal field has been transformed by software too. For example, it
   [128]replaced paralegals in the previously labor-intensive process of
   sifting through documents during the discovery phase of a lawsuit.

   No one, it seems, is more aware of this phenomenon than the
   technologists themselves. In [129]an interview with Pando Daily, Josh
   Kopelman, a venture capitalist with First Round Capital, said that even
   his industry is going to be eaten by software. "In fifteen years, will
   VCs make as much money as they do now?" he was asked. "They probably
   shouldn't," was his response.

Survival of the fittest--and the richest

   Barring a civilization-ending event, technology is not going to move
   backward. More and more of our world will be controlled by software.
   It's already become so ubiquitous that, argues one of my colleagues,
   [130]it's now ridiculous to call some firms as "tech" companies when
   all companies depend on it so much.

   So how do we deal with this trend? The possible solutions to the
   problems of disruption by thinking machines are beyond the scope of
   this piece. As I've mentioned in [131]other pieces published at Quartz,
   there are [132]plenty of optimists ready to declare that the rise of
   the machines will ultimately enable higher standards of living, or at
   least forms of unemployment as foreign to us as "big data scientist"
   would be to a scribe of the 17th century.

   But that's only as long as you're one of the ones telling machines what
   to do, not being told by them. And that will require self-teaching,
   creativity, entrepreneurialism and other traits that may or may not be
   latent in children, as well as retraining adults who aspire to middle
   class living. For now, sadly, your safest bet is to be a technologist
   and/or own capital, and use all this automation to grab a
   bigger-than-ever share of a pie that continues to expand.
