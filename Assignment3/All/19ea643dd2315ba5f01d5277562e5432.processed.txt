Drug addiction: The complex truth

   We're told studies have proven that drugs like heroin and cocaine
   instantly hook a user. But it isn't that simple - little-known
   experiments over 30 years ago tell a very different tale.

   Drugs are scary. The words "heroin" and "cocaine" make people flinch.
   It's not just the associations with crime and harmful health effects,
   but also the notion that these substances can undermine the identities
   of those who take them. One try, [14]we're told, is enough to get us
   hooked. This, it would seem, is confirmed by animal experiments.

   Many studies have shown rats and monkeys will neglect food and drink in
   favour of pressing levers to obtain morphine (the lab form of heroin).
   With the right experimental set up, some rats [15]will self-administer
   drugs until they die. At first glance it looks like a simple case of
   the laboratory animals [16]losing control of their actions to the drugs
   they need. It's easy to see in this a frightening scientific fable
   about the power of these drugs to rob us of our free will.

   But there is more to the real scientific story, even if it isn't widely
   talked about. The results of a set of little-known experiments carried
   out more than 30 years ago paint a very different picture, and
   illustrate how easy it is for neuroscience to be twisted to pander to
   popular anxieties. The vital missing evidence is a [17]series of
   studies carried out in the late 1970s in what has become known as
   [18]"Rat Park". Canadian psychologist Bruce Alexander, at the Simon
   Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, suspected that the
   preference of rats to morphine over water in previous experiments might
   be affected by their housing conditions.

   To test his hypothesis he built an enclosure measuring 95 square feet
   (8.8 square metres) for a colony of rats of both sexes. Not only was
   this around 200 times the area of standard rodent cages, but Rat Park
   had decorated walls, running wheels and nesting areas. Inhabitants had
   access to a plentiful supply of food, perhaps most importantly the rats
   lived in it together.

   Rats are smart, social creatures. Living in a small cage on their own
   is a form of sensory deprivation. Rat Park was what neuroscientists
   would call an [19]enriched environment, or - if you prefer to look at
   it this way - a non-deprived one. In Alexander's tests, rats reared in
   cages drank as much as 20 times more morphine than those brought up in
   Rat Park.

   Inhabitants of Rat Park could be induced to drink more of the morphine
   if it was mixed with sugar, but a control experiment suggested that
   this was because they liked the sugar, rather than because the sugar
   allowed them to ignore the bitter taste of the morphine long enough to
   get addicted. When naloxone, which blocks the effects of morphine, was
   added to the morphine-sugar mix, the rats' consumption didn't drop. In
   fact, their consumption increased, suggesting they were actively trying
   to avoid the effects of morphine, but would put up with it in order to
   get sugar.

   `Woefully incomplete'

   The results are catastrophic for the simplistic idea that [20]one use
   of a drug inevitably hooks the user by rewiring their brain. When
   Alexander's rats were given something better to do than sit in a bare
   cage they turned their noses up at morphine because they preferred
   playing with their friends and exploring their surroundings to getting
   high.

   Further support for his emphasis on living conditions came from another
   set of tests his team carried out in which rats brought up in ordinary
   cages were forced to consume morphine for 57 days in a row. If anything
   should create the conditions for chemical rewiring of their brains,
   this should be it. But once these rats were moved to Rat Park they
   chose water over morphine when given the choice, although they did
   exhibit some minor withdrawal symptoms.

   You can read more about Rat Park in [21]the original scientific report.
   A good summary is in [22]this comic by Stuart McMillen. The results
   aren't widely cited in the scientific literature, and the studies were
   discontinued after a few years because they couldn't attract funding.
   There have been criticisms of the study's design and the few attempts
   that have been made to replicate the results have been mixed.

   Nonetheless the research does demonstrate that the standard
   [23]"exposure model" of addiction is woefully incomplete. It takes far
   more than the simple experience of a drug - even drugs as powerful as
   cocaine and heroin - to make you an addict. The alternatives you have
   to drug use, which will be influenced by your social and physical
   environment, play important roles as well as the brute pleasure
   delivered via the chemical assault on your reward circuits.

   For a psychologist like me it suggests that even addictions can be
   thought of using [24]the same theories we use to think about other
   choices, there isn't a special exception for drug-related choices. Rat
   Park also suggests that when stories about the effects of drugs on the
   brain are promoted to the neglect of the discussion of the personal and
   social contexts of addiction, science is servicing our collective
   anxieties rather than informing us.

   This is my [25]BBC Future article from tuesday. The original is
   [26]here. The [27]Foddy article I link to in the last paragraph is
   great, read that. As is [28]Stuart's comic.

       To my mind this mechanism explains also the high incidence of
       mental disorders in drug users. People self medicate due to lack of
       proper support. It's irritating to see many studies making the
       inverse conclusion that drugs cause mental disorders. Also the
       dutch free heroin on prescription showed that addicts can function
       completely normally in society once the time/effort needed to
       obtain the product has been eliminated. Also the inverse
       cannabis/psychosis studies are annoying since they prohibit
       politicians making the right policies.
       A worrying example is France where deadly violence due to the
       illegal cannabis trade has reached 1930's gangster proportions with
       the only difference that the tommygun has been replaced with the
       AK47. The asinine response of the french government is to increase
       the war on cannabis whilst its blindingly obvious to common sense
       that legalizing it would take away the majority of reasons for the
       voilence.

       Carl Hart says more or less the same in his book."High Price". Like
       the previous commentator, I am horrified by the destructive effect
       of the asinine "war on drugs", counter-scientific and inhuman.
       Anything less ethical than drawing nonhumans into this ridiculous,
       cruel and counter productive business can hardly be imagined,
       unless it's to show that callousness is at the root of this human
       behaviour as well as that displayed to the poor which drives them
       into drugs in the first place.

       It makes intuitive sense that an environment with limited freedom,
       limited exercise, limited social interaction and limited "play"
       would promote both stress and the formation of patterns of
       addiction. Could this be another factor linking poverty and
       substance abuse?

       legalizing it would take away the majority of reasons for the

       Would legalizing cannabis take away human GREED?
       Many say Prohibition was stupid. Yet, look at America now. There
       are so many alcoholic and drug rehab and social services and
       dysfunctional families from LEGALIZING ALCOHOL...Did that really
       remove VIOLENCE? How many alcoholic fathers beat their children and
       wives? How about DUI and drunk drivers?
       If legalizing alcohol was supposed to remove violence someone
       forgot to tell New Orleans as it has a murder rate 10 times the
       national average, highest poverty rates and illiteracy rates in
       America, yet has the most bars per capita in America.
       Oh, and isn't America 16 TRILLION in debt from social services that
       are supporting the effects of ALCOHOL via dysfunction families, via
       Section 8 housing, EBT, food stamps, rehabs, health services,
       mental health services, schools with kids from dysfunctional
       families where parents and teachers blame each other, etc...
       And what about Europe? If legalization was working there, where is
       the MONEY? They have so many social programs the EURO is about to
       breakup and how many bailouts????

            To suggest that the Euro problem is due to legal alchohol is
            simply dishonest. Legalised alchohol? It was never illegal!
            Please.
            You blame the alchohol. Anyone with an ounce of sense can see
            that the problem begins with the poverty, as clearly shown in
            the studies quoted above.
            I think if you want to look for where the US is in debt from,
            look to all those stupid wars you insist on starting, and the
            millions in jail over cannabis. There's your national
            addictions.
            You simply have an agenda and will bend any old factoid to try
            and support it. Must try harder.

            The Netherlands it's working fine, except that they have to
            work around EU legislation which makes it rather messy
            legalwise. Which is the reason they can't levy tax, else
            they'd done it already. As it stand snow the larger cities are
            starting giving cannabis culture permits to professional
            agriculturists. As for addiction etc. the level of
            addiction,related crime, health problems is still directly
            linked to the level of criminalization, where USA scores worst
            and the Netherlands scores best.
            As for being in debt, i fail to see how that's drug related
            and/or relevant

       If the Netherlands is working fine, why do Russian men, who have a
       high number of alcoholic, e.g. vodka, have a very very low life
       expectancy? And in fact, Russia's population is decreasing so bad
       due to alcohol, they have to PAY women to have babies!!!
       And how many men in Afghanistan are under the influence of drugs
       like opium? And how are they doing?
       Or what about those Latin American countries that are biggest
       exporters of drugs? If they are doing so well with legalzing drugs,
       why are they so poor that their workers can't find jobs in Latin
       America? Why are they fleeing those drug countries if it is so
       great to legalize drugs?

            Because people try to escape the nasty reality of a crappy
            world. Very simple. That's why. Has nothing to do with
            legalization. Since 40 yrs the Netherlands have semilegal
            cannabis & hard drugs. The level of addicts remains the
            same/lower.
            Exceptions taken into account people do drugs because the

            What does the lifespan of Russian men have to do with The
            Netherlands?
            What does alcohol addiction in Russia have to do with The
            Netherlands' Marijuana usage?
            How have you concluded that Russia's population decline is due
            solely to alcohol? Surely alcohol is just a single reason in a
            sea of many.
            Afghanistan has always been a major supplier of opium to other
            countries. There are obviously pros and cons to allowing a
            percentage of your farming population to grow poppies while
            drug use is forbidden. Do you have anything specific to say
            about it?
            What Latin American countries have legalized export of
            narcotics? How have you concluded all of their societal woes
            are the result of illicit drugs?

            I don't think it is a `humans are more important' issue in
            regards to animal experimentation. It is just that there are
            currently not many other options to test hypotheses -- can't
            do human studies till you try it out on non-human animals
            first. We have to give our own species more consideration.
            Plus, if we stopped all animal experimentation, how would
            grad-students prove their thesis? There is a huge market out
            there that would crash (it is bigger than you'd realize); jobs
            would be lost, equipment manufactures & labs shut down, ...etc
            ...
            Similar to why we still put up with power plants burning coal.
            We need electricity. If that is how they run, we can't just
            turn the power off and wait for them to implement something
            new, untested, and won't produce as much energy as the current
            system does. It has to be done in stages. There is a lot less
            experimentation done on animals now then there used to be --
            due to improvements in software simulation technology.
            However, it is still in the development stages.

       Having been around drug and alcohol treatment centers for quite a
       while, I feel very confident in saying that addiction is directly
       related to attachment disorder. Sure there is likely a
       physiological or hereditary tendency but the perfect storm happens
       when someone with attachment issues and the appropriate genetic
       markers is introduced to the drug. It's much the same as a platoon
       of soldiers in combat, all experiencing the same hell, when only
       one or two will experience PTSD.

       Folks, there is more than one issue here. The original point of the
       article, as I see it, was a critique of the way neuroscience
       findings are seized upon, gullibly, eclipsing all other accounts.
       The issue of drugs, the moral panic they have evoked, and the
       economic and political costs, was just an example. (And gross
       lapses of netiquette are commonest when such passions are aroused.)
       But I'd like to get back to the earlier, more science-y point.
       There are other studies of the beneficial effects of environment on
       promoting resilience and well-being, most of which are overlooked
       by a science establishment pre-occupied with medical solutions
       (since they are more readily marketable?). My favourite is a study
       [Döbrössy & Dunnett, 2008] that showed that "enriched housing
       "(sic) combats the onset and severity of Huntingdon's Disease - one
       the few illnesses for which a single gene genetic causal factor is
       well established. There are similar studies of recovery from head
       injury, and a host of similar conditions. The point here is that
       for the general public, and politicians, under-valuing of research
       on built environment effects is systemic - but is now becoming
       recognised within the research couunity.

       Twelve years ago, Portugal eliminated criminal penalties for drug
       users. Since then, those caught with small amounts of marijuana,
       cocaine or heroin go unindicted and possession is a misdemeanor on
       par with illegal parking. Experts are pleased with the results.

            Being instantly hooked by heroin & Cocaine is false but the
            concept comes from observations of dissolution and personal
            fear of being that way (loss of status, giving up, etc).
            Politically, that fear is a hot button. It can be used to
            justify wars or anything. A nation of users would need an
            embassy in DC. There's obviously money available but it's all
            going into development of the problem instead of it's
            resolution. A plan would help.

       >But there is more to the real scientific story, even if it isn't
       widely talked about.
       Fortunately, David Sheff has restarted the conversation on the
       complexity of addiction with his 2013 bestselling book Clean:
       Overcoming Addiction and Ending America's Greatest Tragedy (as of
       this writing, #7150 on Amazon). He writes, "Given the current state
       of science's understanding of addiction, there's no conclusive
       answer as to why one person's drug use escalates and another's
       doesn't. Everyone's different, and everyone reacts differently to
       different drugs, different amounts and combinations of them, and
       different ways drugs are administered, because of each person's
       unique biology, psychology, and environment. But some factors that
       influence the likelihood of addiction are known" (p.81). This
       corroborates tomstafford's point, "It takes far more than the
       simple experience of a drug - even drugs as powerful as cocaine and
       heroin - to make you an addict." Sheff cites factors such as age of
       first use, genetics, and pre-existing psychiatric illnesses. For
       those interested, Chapter 5 explores current thought on the origins
       of addictions more thoroughly.

       If environment is a factor, has no one thought of outdoor fitness
       as a treatment? I don't mean to take the "environment" findings
       literally. But a matter of enrichment combined with the "runner's
       high" seems like a logical choice.
       Of course getting drug addicts to hit the trails is a whole other
       matter. But I think at least some would be willing to try.

            20% of first aid admissions are sports related. Less then 20%
            are drugs related. Seems a rather ineffectual solution cost

       In the 1970s an academic, a chemist at one of the London
       Universities, walked into the common room and declared to all and
       sundry that he thought that drug addiction was a myth. What's more,
       he said, he was going to prove it. He bought some heroin from one
       of the chemical suppliers, injected himself with the appropriate
       dose for a month and then at the end of this month ... stopped. He
       simply packed it in with no ill effects.
       No doubt a great number of your readership will know (or can guess)
       who the chap was.
