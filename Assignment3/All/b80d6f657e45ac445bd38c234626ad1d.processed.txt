   What's This?

   When asked in a recent interview about his advice for [48]Twitter's
   possible IPO, [49]Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg joked
   that he would probably be the "last" person one would want to consult
   on "how to make a smooth IPO."

   Zuckerberg and Facebook went through one of the rockiest public
   offerings in recent memory thanks to a number of factors: too many
   shares offered at too high a price, significant last-minute downward
   revisions to ad revenue projections and major glitches on the NASDAQ
   during the first minutes of trading. The end result was that Facebook
   only traded above its IPO price [50]once during its entire first year.

   Twitter's leadership team probably won't choose to follow Facebook's
   IPO playbook -- Zuckerberg is right about that -- but they will likely
   be very mindful of avoiding Facebook's many mistakes.

   "Facebook was the first of its kind in terms of the hype and the
   ubiquity of it," Santosh Rao, an analyst with Greencrest Capital, told
   Mashable. "Twitter has enough to go by: they know what to do and what
   not to do."

Learning From Facebook's Mistakes

   Rao and other analysts we spoke with expect Twitter will attempt to
   control expectations for its IPO by introducing fewer shares at first,
   keeping the share price down and placing tighter restrictions on people
   selling off stock on the private market. Rao said he previously heard
   that Twitter placed a cap on how many shares individuals can sell on
   the private market.

   "They've learned from the Facebook disaster and have managed to control
   the frenzy around it," he said.

   Indeed, recent reports suggest Twitter's IPO playbook could be summed
   up with five words: Do the opposite of Facebook. Facebook chose Morgan
   Stanley as its lead banker with mixed results; Twitter is
   [52]reportedly going with Goldman Sachs. Facebook decided to trade on
   the NASDAQ; Twitter is said to be [53]leaning toward the New York Stock
   Exchange.

   The most noticeable difference at this stage is how Twitter chose to
   file for IPO: The social network opted to [54]file a confidential S-1
   for its IPO rather than a public S-1 as Facebook was forced to do. By
   going this route, Twitter can delay some of the media frenzy that
   Facebook experienced after disclosing its numbers and later revising
   them. Twitter also can avoid posting sensitive business information for
   competitors to see until closer to the IPO -- 21 days before, to be
   exact.

     Confidential S1s? But what could be wrong with releasing 100s of
     pages of new financial and strategic co. info to the Internet while
     gagged?

     -- Andrew Mason (@andrewmason) [55]September 13, 2013

Facebook's Stock Gains Are Good for Twitter

   Just as Twitter may be able to benefit from Facebook's missteps, it may
   also benefit from the resurgence of Facebook and other recent Internet
   IPOs. Facebook and [56]LinkedIn both hit new [57]all-time highs earlier
   this month, shortly before Twitter announced that it had filed to go
   public. That was probably deliberate.

   "I think the week of the filing is more coincident with the rally than
   anything," said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.
   "To the extent that the early investors in Twitter are looking for an
   exit, this is about as good as it's going to get."

   According to Pachter, Twitter's share price on the private market has
   traded "in concert with" Facebook's share price on the public market.
   Twitter, he says, traded around $20 in the lead up to the Facebook IPO,
   then dipped back to $17 as Facebook's stock began to decline. Twitter's
   stock has since surged to the high-$20 range as Facebook's stock has
   rallied back above its IPO price.

   "There's wind behind [Twitter] right now," Rao says. "The Facebook
   disaster and the negative sentiment around private companies lasted for
   almost a year. That's gone now after Facebook came back and proved
   their model."

Will History Repeat Itself?

   While Twitter stands to benefit from some of Facebook's mistakes, it
   may also be handicapped in at least one way that Facebook wasn't: Fewer
   investors have first-hand experience using it.

   "I would bet you that 80% to 90% of institutional investors are
   Facebook users and maybe 20% use Twitter," Pachter said. That will make
   it all the more important for Twitter's management team to educate
   investors on its strategy during the road show prior to the IPO, and
   for investors to educate themselves on how Twitter works, where it
   generates revenue from and who it does and doesn't compete with. "I
   talk to investors who think they're savvy and say that Reddit is a
   threat to Twitter. They don't get it."

   Lise Buyer, an analyst with Class V Group who helped [61]Google go
   public in 2004, emphasized that the key takeaway from Facebook's IPO
   debacle is that investors need to focus more on learning the basics of
   a business rather than focusing on the headlines and the hype.
   Otherwise, investors may be in for an unpleasant surprise.

   "The real lesson of the Facebook IPO is that investors should do their
   best to understand the fundamentals, size, growth and potential
   profitability before placing an order, rather than buying an IPO purely
   because a company is large, exciting or in the headlines," Buyer wrote
   in an email to Mashable shortly before Twitter revealed it had filed to
   go public.

   "Some IPOs go up and some go down," she added. "There are no certain
   bets."
