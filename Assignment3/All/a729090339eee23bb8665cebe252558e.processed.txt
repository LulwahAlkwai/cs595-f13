FalconUAV Supports Colorado Flooding Until Grounded By FEMA

   [61]Interesting news from our friends at Falcon UAV in Colorado:

     In the wake of the recent floods in Colorado, Falcon UAV has spent
     the last three days providing volunteer aerial services to the
     Boulder County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and the Incident
     Management Team (IMT).  On Thursday afternoon while all National
     Guard aircraft were grounded due to weather Falcon UAV was proud to
     have been the only aircraft that was able to take flight to support
     the flood efforts in Lyons.

     Friday saw a reprieve in the weather and we are able to get a
     perfect flight off in the town of Longmont to capture aerial imagery
     for damage assesment at the intersection of the overflowing St Vrain
     river and equally inundated Left Hand Creek.   In less than an hour
     the imagery was processed and provided to the Boulder EOC.  Just as
     Falcon UAV was off to another damage assessment in Lyons, Colorado
     we were requested to standdown for National Guard helicopters now
     supporting evacuation efforts.

     [63][flooding.gif?width=750]

     Enter FEMA.......

     Early Saturday morning Falcon UAV was heading up to Lyons to
     complete a damage assessment mapping flight when we received a call
     from our Boulder EOC point of contact who notified us that FEMA had
     taken over operations and our request to fly drones was not only
     denied but more specifically we were told by FEMA that anyone flying
     drones would be arrested.  Not being one to bow to federal
     bureaucrats we still went up to Lyons to do a site survey for how we
     can conduct a mission in the near future to provide an adequate
     damage assessment to this storm raveged community.

     Where bridge to the south side of Lyons used to be

     Road into Lyons, CO

     While we were up there we noticed that Civil Air Patrol and private
     aircraft were authorized to fly over the small town tucked into the
     base of Rockies.  Unfortunately due to the high terrain around Lyons
     and large turn radius of manned aircraft they were flying well out
     of a useful visual range and didn't employ cameras or live video
     feed to support the recovery effort.  Meanwhile we were grounded on
     the Lyons high school football field with two Falcons that could
     have mapped the entire town in less than 30 minutes with another few
     hours to process the data providing a near real time map of the
     entire town.

     Falcon UAV would like to thank the Boulder County EOC and
     specifically Allen Bishop and Michael Chard (while they were running
     operations) for their common sense approach to drone operations,
     working to coordinate the airspace, as well as embracing this
     technology to help support the recovery effort.  In contrast we are
     very disappointed in FEMAs response to actively prevent the use of
     UAVs and drone technology when these services were offered for free
     and at a time when manned helicopters could be used for more
     critical missions such as evacuations and high mountain search and
     rescues in inaccessible communities.

     To our fellow Colordoans, we understand the recovery efforts are
     still ongoing and will be followed by a long period of damage
     assessment.  If we can provide volunteer aerial video, photography,
     or mapping services to any of the affected communities please
     contact us directly at 303-903-4571.

          Great work guys :)
          That is so typical of government agencies...

          FEMA should offer you a reward. Not shut you down.

          Good for you !

          Ham fisted exercise of authority because they can.

          Clearly human lives and emergency assistance are not Femas
          priority.

          Defending their turf against misguided do-gooders is clearly
          much more important.

          Emergency Management doesn't mean saving lives, obviously
          showing you who is the Boss is the central issue!

          Awesome work guys.
          How did FEMA ground you?  I would think only the FAA could do
          that.

          I loaded that KMZ file in google earth. My goodness, what
          disaster agency wouldn't want that data?

          You can fly over high res details of the flood in seconds. Nice
          job.

          I believe FEMA actually has pretty much total legal authority in
          emergencies.

          Not to say they always use it wisely.

          Someone didn't got paid and they got mad ;)  Here is a good
          example why we all work hard on ardupilol/arducopter. This is a
          great way to show potential of low cost UAVs. We don't need
          multimillion devices to do simple tasks in efficient and safe
          way.

          Congratulations to CM. and others @ Falcon UAV. Keep up the
          spirit,

          Wow, I didn't realize how amazing what you were doing is until I
          downloaded that file.  Pretty cool that you can turn that file
          on/off in GE with the click of a button to get a quick
          before/after.  Are you able to share the workflow to generate
          that file?  I'm surprised at how well it overlays with GE
          imagery, as I've often found a pretty large offset between GE
          imagery and my GPS data.

   Comment by [86]Todd Hill on September 15, 2013 at 10:17am
           Excellent work!  This would make a good case study for
          demonstrating the effectiveness of such technology in post
          disaster assessements.  The only way we are going to get rid of
          this type of posturing by bureaucracies is making people more
          informed when situations such as this happen.  Share the link.

           I think that one could effectively argue that this is
          borderline gross negligence by FEMA.  They are in effect
          hampering the expediency of the recovery efforts, and wasting
          valuable recovery resources.   End of diatribe.
