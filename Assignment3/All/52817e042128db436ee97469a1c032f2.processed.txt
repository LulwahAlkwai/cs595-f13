   "What the hell is wrong with you? We're a family!"

   I hope you watched "Ozymandias" with someone you loved. First of all,
   because I watched it alone -- Mrs. Tuned In is not a Breaking Bad
   watcher -- and holy bejeezus in a fire truck, that was a rough ride to
   take solo. If the end of last week's episode was a thousand-bullet
   fusillade, this one was like feeling every one of those bullets hit. It
   was relentless, intense, excruciating -- and amazing. If each remaining
   episode intensifies this much more than the last, I am going to burst
   into flames.

   But I also say that because, while Breaking Bad may be about drugs and
   crime and morality and all that good, tragic-downfall stuff, at heart
   it's about family: what you do for them, what they do to you and how
   you fail them. The beginning of "Ozymandias" (read [75]the Shelley poem
   if you want to know why a hubristic ruin in the desert is relevant)
   takes us back to simpler times, when Skyler was just an aspiring writer
   packing up a crying clown for a $9 eBay profit and Walt was just a
   struggling teacher/car-wash worker with [76]cancer, cooking up his
   first batch of methamphetamine in an RV. Back then, Walt still had to
   prep himself to lie on the telephone. Back then, Skyler was asking him
   to bring home a pizza, not preparing to carve him into slices. Walt was
   still doing this for his wife and kids. He believed he was going to
   die, but there were still possibilities.

   It's a little over a year ago. It feels like another time, another
   planet. Vince Gilligan has famously said that Breaking Bad is the story
   of how Mr. Chips becomes Scarface. And it's true, and that's the
   exciting, attention-getting way of putting it. But it is equally, and
   heartbreakingly, the story of the journey from "Will do. Love you" to
   "You stupid bitch! How dare you."

   (MORE: [77]Breaking Bad Watch: Here Comes the Cavalry)

   But before we get to that, a little unfinished family business: Hank,
   who -- despite Walt's desperate protest that "he's family" -- does die
   (along with Gomez). It seems at first that he might not; Jack readies
   to pull the trigger time after time only to be forestalled, and in past
   episodes this is where Walt might have pulled one more trick, made one
   more deal. But not this time; as Hank says, there is no deal to be
   made, and the difference between him and Walt is that he won't go down
   bargaining and begging. That is, he is going to be who he is -- "My
   name is ASAC Hank Schrader, and you can go f-- yourself" -- and unlike
   his brother-in-law, he will own the consequences.

   Walt crumples to the desert floor, broken. When he gets up, it's not to
   receive the dignity of death, or even of being robbed outright; Jack
   leaves him $11 million, one barrel of cash, as a gesture of Todd's
   respect -- but it's truly blood money now, as if Jack were not stealing
   from Walt but just taking a heavy commission for killing Hank. It seems
   as if Walt's last scruple died on the desert floor with Hank: he
   demands an end to Jesse -- whom he taunts with Jane's last moments --
   and to roll his barrel of cash home.

   It is to Breaking Bad`s credit that this hellish scene in the desert is
   not nearly the toughest thing in the episode to watch. For starters,
   there's the scene I've dreaded since the first season: Walt Jr.,
   sensitive and worshipful of his dad, learns the truth. (We see only the
   aftermath, not the actual revelation, and I'm more grateful for that
   than for not directly seeing Hank take a bullet to the head.) Walt
   still carries the crazy, desperate hope that he and his family can
   survive this -- that they can disappear with a money barrel, forget
   everything and love each other. But that hope dies in Skyler's office
   with Jr., just as surely as it did in the desert with Hank.

   It's always been about family for Walt: that was his original impulse,
   his justification through his own criminal career, and the line he told
   himself he would not cross with Hank. Back at the White house, we saw
   that he had well and truly killed all that. He has killed the love that
   was the one genuine good thing left in him, he has ruined the happiness
   of the family he told himself he was saving. Wrestling the love of his
   life on the floor with a butcher's knife, seeing his firstborn and
   namesake throw himself over Skyler ready to take a stabbing for her,
   Walt must see that his family -- at least, a version with him in it --
   is over at last.

   But there's Holly. It makes perfect sense, doesn't it? -- at least it
   does to Heisenberg, who is about rationalizing situations and finding
   an escape. Maybe he can't have his family, but he can have a family:
   $11 million and the tabula rasa of Holly, who will remember only the
   best of him, who will not turn on him or resent him, who will always
   appreciate her Daddy. As he horrifyingly peels out of the driveway,
   deafening himself to Skyler's screams, you can see Heisenberg take
   control; to him, this is another unpleasantness to get past, one final
   loss to jettison like the barrels of cash he surrendered to Jack in the
   desert. He won't have all his money, but he'll have a new start. He
   won't have his wife and son, but he'll have a family. Entirely on his
   terms. Clean slate. Nice and neat, the way Heisenberg likes it.

   Instead, however, Skyler and Walt each hear something from their
   children that makes them find something better in themselves. For
   Skyler, it's Walt Jr. telling her that she is just as bad as Walt for
   not resisting him. And for Walt: "Mama." He may have engineered a
   perfect escape, but he seems to realize, far gone and monstrous as he
   is, that a family born of money and amnesia will never be his real
   family, or Holly's.

   (MORE: [78]Breaking Bad Watch: You Gotta Keep the Devil Way Down in the
   Hole)

   This culminates in a brutal and heartbreaking phone call to bookend the
   episode's beginning, one that makes clear why Bryan Cranston and Anna
   Gunn should be adding Emmys to their families a year and a week hence.
   Knowing, presumably, that Skyler will be on the hook for his crimes, he
   gives her an alibi by excoriating and threatening her in the worst
   terms.

   It's an incredible performance of an incredible performance; where the
   Walt of the flashback was nervous and awkward in his lying, here Walt
   unleashes his crime-lord fury, allowing himself only tiny, silent sobs
   when he pauses. I want to say that his resentment and fury at Skyler is
   for show -- but it's not entirely fake, is it? It's clearly not what he
   wants to say to Skyler in the moment. It's not, ultimately, what he
   thinks of her or wants for her. But we've seen enough of him to know
   that it comes from a real place -- that there is at least part of Walt
   that does rage at being misunderstood and held back and unappreciated.
   He draws on it now self-sacrificingly, though it kills him, but it is
   still there in him to be drawn on. He's a method actor, that Walt is.

   In the end -- or rather, two episodes from the end -- it does indeed
   come down to family for Walter White. And he finally realizes here that
   he can save his family only by leaving it. That bitter, furious,
   threatening monster on the phone just now may not be all of him. But
   it's the part of him that's put him where he is now: being disappeared
   by Mr. Vacuum Guy, with a barrel of money to keep him company, looking
   at everything he loves in the rearview mirror.

   Now for the hail of bullets:

   * Very unfortunate product placement there for KoalaKare changing
   tables.

   * Just as Walt turns up the malice in his call to Skyler for show, he
   also tells Jesse about Jane in the most diabolical taunting way
   possible. (Here, I'm guessing, out of anger rather than from a plan,
   but tell me if you disagree.) Walt saw himself as letting Jane die to
   save Jesse -- because he cared about him or because he needed his
   partner -- but he offers no mitigating argument here, making the deed
   sound as ugly as possible to twist the knife. Your guesses welcome as
   to whether this will come back to haunt him.

   * "We could get it out of him back home. I could do it. We've got a
   history [cheerfully]. And we could take care of the job after that!" Is
   there a sweeter, more terrifying sociopath than Todd?

   * Breaking Bad loves the desert, and "Ozymandias'" opening minutes were
   a distillation of how the series has used the landscape visually: all
   those sky shots and impassive mountains, a sunbaked Walt rolling his
   money across what looks like the yellow floor of hell.

   * I'm not sure I have ever before, while watching TV, literally done
   the thing where you clap your hands over your mouth while your eyes pop
   open. But that was me watching Walt drive off with Baby Holly.

   * I had no advance screeners this week and wrote this live, and fast,
   in the interest of getting the discussion going quickly. So apologies
   for any egregious errors. Next week, because I can't review Breaking
   Bad and the Emmys at once, there's a good chance there will be a
   substitute reviewer in this space. I'll be back for the finale. But I'm
   scared.

   Thanks for this great and evenly paced review.  Very insightful, and
   not just a "short list".  It's difficult to write about a show like
   this with so much involved, and so many different stories within the
   story.  The depth of the writing in Breaking Bad shows talent that has
   done their homework.  But I can see that [84]Poniewozik has done his
   homework here too, when he starts by mentioning the poem by Shelley.
   Nice work James.

   This episode is just another example of why this show is so over
   rated.  Walt should have been the one to pull the trigger.  Does anyone
   really believe that Walt would have been so torn up over Hank getting
   killed.  Just nonsensical.  The writing in this show has been so
   crappy...and so over rated..since about the mid point in season two.

   It seems to me that Walter gave away some clues to what is going to
   happen at the end of season 5  while during season two chapter 4
   (Down); he tells Skyler about him having a strange dream where he was
   owner of an antique bike repair shop in Ireland. It seems that Mr.
   White is going to take a trip to Ireland. I don't think Jesse will be
   killed, and I also think Hank deserved what he got for being so
   ruthless and detached unforgiven to others when he considered them to
   be inferior or criminals, throughout the entire series he makes fun of
   dead bodies, beats people and shows no compassion what so ever as long
   as he gets what he wants. I don't think everything Mr. White did was
   right but in all the madness we have to be able to see that even though
   he created an empire in short time he also destroyed a much bigger one
   in less time than DEA could have ever done, and then he got out as
   well. Sometimes to defeat evil you have to play evil. Don't forget that
   the only reason for Mr. White to do all this is for his family not his
   own ego, and that reason is still there although it might seem to have
   vanished.

   It seems to me with Jesse flipping out in previous episodes the
   Heisenberg  persona is hard for Walt to maintain, ---he cannot be a
   tough guy around his family or those he cares about --- with the idea
   his money is being burned (family security) and seeing Hank killed, he
   is rattled.  He seems to be coming to his senses as he is driving away
   in the Chrysler but alas a bullet hole in the gas tank puts the
   recovery on hold a bit.  After the family turns on him and he realizes
   the baby needs to be with her mother and he needs to be truly alone in
   this he goes to set things right.  He does Hank no favors saying that
   he crossed him, he does not implicate Jack and the neo Nazi group in
   anyway because in his mind they are already dead and Walt is going to
   get his money back.  Saving Jesse is going to depend on Jesse, if he is
   still a basket case and thus a threat to Walt and his family, he dies,
   If he learns his lesson and stays off dope long enough, Walt may save
   him in the end.  Getting Skylar a chunk of the $70M he is going to
   recapture will take a call to Saul, for sure.

   Now that Hank is dead I just really dont care what happens to Jesse or
   Walt. I would like to see them reap what they sew. But Hank? He never
   should have gone out like that. Shot and buried in the desert? So
   absolutely insulting. He deserved way better than that.

   I like the Jesse killing Todd through chemistry angle, I hadn't
   explored that too much.

   I do think Walt realized Todd was not going to kill Jesse, but use him
   to cook. Think about the fact that after they didn't kill Jesse, they
   don't get Walt's offer of a final cook - they don't need it either.
   Todd knows Jesse is almost as good. At least good enough to get the
   blue. Then Walt has no power over them at all. Walt maybe realizes this
   and either (as mentioned below) tells Jesse as a stinger, because he
   wants him to know before he dies (but doesn't want to seem sympathetic
   toward Jesse in front of the Nazis) or, finally, maybe he wants Jesse
   to be the one who takes him down and he will go to save Jesse. This
   last piece of information can be the 'too much' that Jesse needs to not
   come back to Walt's side once he rescues him. If Walt rescued him under
   the current circumstances, Jesse might forgive him and maybe Walt wants
   it all to end, but on his own terms, by his 'favoured son'/progeny.

   I am a "Bad" Man through and through, but as one who was heavily
   involved in the "drug scene"(not meth) and who finally escaped and got
   his soul back, All this talk about "family" is fine If you need to hang
   your hat on something, go right ahead. However, I can state that where
   Walt is, family has little to do with it. It's all about "ME". How can
   I pull off a bigger deal? Which friend or total stranger can I pull
   into my web and watch go down, but still sell them more? How much more
   money can I make, family and lifelong friends be damned? Eventually it
   comes down to exactly where Walt is now. Just you and the drug. Far
   away from anyone you knew or loved. Great show!

   This episode was one of a few that came close to Sopranos for me, I
   mean the whole series doesn't come close to the perfection of Sopranos
   but this was as close to an episode like 'Knight in White Satin', 'Pax
   Soprano', or 'Fortunate Son' as I have ever seen.
   Ultimately Breaking is shaping up to be the third most superior show on
   TV in this current era somewhere after Mad Men tied with or even too
   Game of Thrones....episodes like this make me think it just edges over
   Game right now.

   So many amazing things in this episode. It's mind boggling. Two things
   that stuck with me. First, Skyler is unwittingly to blame for Hank's
   death. So ironic because she was the one who accused Walt of bringing
   danger to the family. She led Walt to kill Jesse and were it not for
   that, Walt wouldn't have had the nazis on-call or led them to the
   desert. Second, Walt literally dug Hank's grave with his own hands.
   Little did he know.

   Walt telling Jesse about how he watched Jane die was all because it was
   Jesse's fault that Hank got killed. Walt did not know that Jesse was
   working with Gomez and Hank. Walt found that out after calling Jack to
   come take care of Jesse cause Walt was being set up. Since Jack didnt
   kill Jesse right infront of Walt's eyes like Walt wanted (Todd's
   fault), Walt told Jesse about Jane because he wanted to kill/hurt Jesse
   in the biggest way possible. Brock may have been a clencher for Jesse,
   but Jane? that was a 2x4 to the face. and as for Walts final call to
   Skylar? That was for reason. He knew the cops would be there, he took
   his daughter to make sure the cops would be called. Re-watch the scene
   with him talking to Skylar when she's with the police, Marie and Jr. 1)
   Walter is crying while threatening Skylar. and 2) you can see Skylars
   reaction change from 'BRING BACK HOLLY' to a sad "im sorry". Skylar
   helped Walt out a heck of a lot with the money and the opening of the
   car wash to launder the money. Walt helped her in return and made her
   free from all the problems he's brought to them. He purposely
   threatened her on the phone so she wont be accused of anything. Walt
   basically blamed the entire thing on himself. Such a sad moment, and
   soo beautifully written. i couldn't stop crying this episode :(

   P.S Todd is a snake using Brock as a lure to make Jesse cook for him!

   I missed the show last night and was practically scared, after hearing
   all the hubbub today, to watch. I do think the show, overall, is
   something special -- if you like this sort of thing. But this episode
   was nothing special in itself. For the first time in a long time with
   this show, I felt a tiny bit impatient, like I was just waiting for
   what has to happen (in order for us all to remain completely unchanged
   by what we're taking in) to happen. And it did.

   I had to watch it alone and it SUUUUCKED not to have someone with me. I
   also covered my mouth with my hand when I saw that scene now that you
   mention it. I was just so into the show it felt real. Could not BELIEVE
   Walt would do it... but as you said, it wasn't Walt, it was Heisenberg.
   That's who he is now and there's no going back.
   Thanks for pointing out that his contemptuous phone call with Skyler
   was a partially a gift to her. I always thought that whenever Walt went
   Heisenberg, he borrowed from his own emotions as Walt to get through
   whatever needed to happen. In this case though, I was confused by how,
   for the second time in a single day, Walt ended up saying dumb things
   on a cell phone, as if unaware of the consequences.
   At the end though, when he broke the burner, I realized that he knew
   the police was there - he HAD to know that. Now following what you
   said, I realize also that this is how they would find Holly -
   triangulating the signal would lead them to the firehouse where he left
   her.

   Not a thing you said was even close to correct, congrats. BB is more
   consistent in its writing, plotting then sopranos. The Wire and BB
   stand alone./

   @dorianblack1 ?? BS, BB surpassed sopranos aehile ago. sopranos had at
   times been guilty of introducing contrived plot polints and characters
   with no explanation, and also had some meh episodes in its middle and
   later seasons.

   Only the wire is on par with BB at this point.

   @dorianblack1 Breaking Bad has only one show to beat: I love Lucy.

   After 50 years since the show closed, the reruns still generate 20
   million a year...AMC will do the same...I look forward to hearing from
   my great grand children about how Walter White shoulda (coulda, woulda)
   done this or that to get away scott free...

   Mad Men is okay, the old school money men's self congratulatory show
   about the serial cheater, 2nd trophy wife mysterious scoundrel which
   women find irresistible who has a talent for selling is like no other
   is not it that great if it were not for the cinematic way the show has
   been filmed...It lost its juice after the second season...

   Game of Thrones has too much story line that isn't explored like that
   who have read the books can attest to, and relies too heavily on the
   extraordinary talents of Peter Dinklage (and his role of a life time
   for "little people" ) and Conleth Hill to carry the the story, along
   with scant amounts of special effects for the dragons...

   It may not have the singular story arc for each episode like CSI or X
   files..but it is a "comedy", albeit a black comedy, wrapped in
   drama, tragedy, and foreboding...as evidenced by Jessie Pinkman's
   tattoo of Santa Muerte (a fallen angel in purgatory trying to win back
   God's favor who grants both good and evil requests) on his back when he
   dresses himself after his beating from Hank...

   Remember Walter blackmailed him into cooking...and Jessie has paid
   dearly for this...Walt has no idea it is Jessie that will seal his doom
   (look at every mishap Walt has faced, Jessie was the reason in each and
   every one of them) and not his actions/reactions...Walt took care a
   business...he just got the wrong partner who he saw as one of his
   students...thus tapping Walt's true weakness...the power of
   knowledge...the snake of Eden...its just too powerful a show to
   disappear from TV even after the last episode airs. People will be
   dissecting the meaning of this show for years to come...

   Yeap, a 50 plus year life span for this show...I can see it...

   @dorianblack1 With such a level of greatness in writing, directing and
   acting, Breaking Bad might be better than The Sopranos, Mad Men or even
   The Wire. Game of Thrones is great, but far from being as good as
   Breaking Bad

   @blazingbrunette I need to go back and watch the phone scene...when I
   first watched it confused me, and only later did I realize it was

   i think everyone forgets about another tv show that had the anti hero
   before BB, it is excellent, its called the "the shield" the final
   season of the shield was every bit as good or may even be better than
   BB and this is comming from someone who has watched BB from the
   begining and loved every minute of it, everyone always talks about the
   wire, it was a good show but in my opinion the shield was much better
   than the wire, vic mackey was the true anti hero before walter white
