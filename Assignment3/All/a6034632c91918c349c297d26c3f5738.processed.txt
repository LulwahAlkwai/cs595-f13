   Abbie Lundberg: Serving CIOs since 1989

   COMMUNICATE VALUE, MANAGE CHANGE

   Lundberg Media is a communication services and advisory company
   specializing in the intersection of business and technology. Services
   include:

   Events

   The pace of technology change is dizzying. But most organizations are
   designed for stability, not change. CIOs and technology marketers share
   a common challenge: how to communicate the real benefits and risks of
   new technologies and speed adoption in a responsible way.

   Lundberg Media helps leaders and their teams translate complex issues
   into focused, compelling messages to gain buy in and deliver
   results. Whether introducing a new technology, delivering a new
   capability or entering a new market, meaningful communication is more
   important than ever to companies' ability to influence stakeholder
   thinking and behavior -- both inside and outside the company. Led by
   longtime former CIO magazine Editor in Chief Abbie Lundberg, Lundberg
   Media is uniquely positioned to help leaders and their teams develop
   powerful and effective communication programs.
