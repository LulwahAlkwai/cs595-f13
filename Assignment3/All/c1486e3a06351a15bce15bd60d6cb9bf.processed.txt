   Rohan Agrawal builds [48]robots -- and he's not even a teenager yet.
   While most kids his age likely spent their summer playing video games
   or on the monkey bars, the 12-year-old wunderkind tinkered away at an
   internship making robots from scratch.

   The pre-teen spent the last few months at OLogic, a Sunnyvale, Calif.,
   company known for designing robots for Google and Disney. While there,
   Agrawal built a device capable of autonomously delivering bags of
   potato chips throughout the office.

   "I'm self taught," says Agrawal, who started programming at age 4, and
   tells Mashable his first language was HTML. "My mom showed me Google
   once and I was really fascinated by it. I asked her how it works and
   she told me you use this thing called HTML."

   He started studying coding, and by age 5 built his first basic website.
   Soon thereafter, a trip to Cuptertino's electronic flea market sparked
   his interest in hardware.

   His parents, both engineers, bought him a digital circuit book and a
   kit, and he started tinkering. He says he built all of the examples in
   the book, hoping not to blow anything up. But he was only 6 years old
   at this point, and there were some accidents. Luckily, no one got hurt.

   The young Agrawal refined his skills by attending a robotics club. At
   age 9 he got a ham radio (a small, experimental communication device)
   license for his birthday. This led him to learn about [50]Arduino
   boards, the programmable mini computer controllers he would use to
   create basic robots. Soon he was building devices like a small robot
   capable of finding an object on a table, and pushing it to a shoe box
   goal at the end of the table. Simple creations, but light years ahead
   of metal erector sets or Legos.

   At the age of 10 he joined the creative group Hacker Dojo, where he
   worked with a team whose goal was to build robots for under $500; a
   challenge, considering how expensive parts and hardware can be.

   rohan inside

   Sensing his son needed more stimulus, Agrawal's father reached out to
   OLogic through the Hacker Dojo, and asked if young Rohan could attend a
   summer internship. The company accepted.

   While at OLogic, Agrawal built a variation of the [51]roomba, the
   iRobot-made autonomous navigation device used for sweeping and
   vacuuming. Agrawal's machine is a play on that -- but instead of
   cleaning room-to-room, it goes into offices and delivers snacks.

   "That's how I got the idea for the autonomous chip robots," he says.
   "All you have to do is type in a command and it runs a program so it
   will automatically drive around and randomly select an audience. I'm
   working on getting it to see if there's anybody in the room. If there
   isn't, it will leave and won't wait."

   The machine works through an existing program called [52]SLAM, which
   stands for simultaneous location and mapping. It allows sensors on the
   device to create maps that see and avoid obstacles.

   OLogic's vice president of engineering, Mike Thompson, who worked
   one-on-one with Agrawal, said having such a young intern was "kind of
   an experiment on our part." But the young developer "absolutely stunned
   us with what he knew."

   "He has an insatiable curiosity about everything robotics," Thompson
   says. "The challenge for us was keeping one to two steps ahead of him
   and keeping him busy."

   OLogic couldn't pay him because of his age, and instead bought him
   lunch everyday. Thompson says he would hire Agrawal if given the
   chance. Here's a video of Agrawal in action at OLogic:

   With the internship over, Agrawal is back at work in his mini-studio, a
   converted garage with a soldering iron and scattered electronics.

   The rest of the time he's at the hacker dojo, where he mentors other
   kids, most of whom are older .

   rohanin the house

   Agrawal, who says he's never seen the classic robot apocalypse
   films Terminator or Blade Runner, says he's looking forward to coming
   innovations, especially Google's[54] driverless cars. He says he wants
   a robot "that can cook so he can make snacks." A robot like that would
   cost at least $100,000, he says, and the machine "would need highly
   dexterous arms with super precision."

   Still years from college, he says he wants to pursue robotics
   professionally -- or computer programming.

   Agrawal's advice to other young, creative minds? "If you're interested
   in something, don't be scared to get into it."
