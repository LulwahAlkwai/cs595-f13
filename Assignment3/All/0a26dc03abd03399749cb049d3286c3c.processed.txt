   AAAS Overseas Fellowships at USAID Missions (Eligibility limited to
   current/alumni AAAS Fellows only)

   Re-launched in 2011, the AAAS Overseas Fellowships offer Fellows the
   experience of living and working overseas at a U.S. Embassy or US
   Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission , as well as the
   opportunity to expand both the service and professional development
   opportunities of the S&T Policy Fellowship experience. AAAS supports
   Fellows to pursue international assignments via the Overseas
   Fellowships. AAAS Overseas Fellowships are currently available only at
   USAID Missions. Overseas Fellowships offer one- to two-year
   international assignments.

   The Fellow's primary responsibility will be to help the Mission
   identify key opportunities to develop strategies and programs that
   contribute to development in science and technology (S&T) and areas
   where S&T can be harnessed to advance development in the host country
   and/or region.

   This fellowship opportunity is limited to current and alumni AAAS
   Science & Technology Policy Fellows. Fellows may have served in any
   program area. Additional criteria and the evaluation and placement
   processes are outlined in the [30]AAAS Overseas Fellowship Guidelines.
