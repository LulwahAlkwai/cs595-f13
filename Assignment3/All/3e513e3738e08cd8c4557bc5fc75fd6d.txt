In particular, he has developed genetic mapping methods of medical relevance, including contributions to the study of families via linkage-analysis, hidden-relatedness via identity-by-descent genetic mapping, and uncovering the hidden relation between ancestry and genetic disorders via admixture-mapping, offering new ways to predict inherited risks of diseases, with immediate... <a href="/rx2013/public/schedule/speaker/162629">Read More</a>.</div>
