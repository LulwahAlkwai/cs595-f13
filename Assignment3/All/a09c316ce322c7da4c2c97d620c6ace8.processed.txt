   File Under Really Bad Idea: EU wants cars that could read speed limit
   signs and automatically apply the brakes.
   Think of the fun, pop up your own 10MPH sign on the freeway and watch
   the mayhem, or as you drive through an area with a conditional sign at
   45 that says 25 when children are present meet a whole bunch of new
   people as the land in your trunk. There are so many ways this could end
   very badly. I'm really not against self-driving cars, particularly when
   you are doing the bumper to bumper commute, but the idea that a car
   could, by seeing a sign, slam on the brakes and adjust your speed isn't
   a good one. On the plus side after 4 or 5 rear end accidents I'm sure
   more people would take public transportation that is unless busses had
   that stupid feature too. (On the other hand I'll bet you always wanted
   to fly from the back to the front of a bus suddenly). The Telegraph on
   why I'm likely not going to vacation or move the EU:
