"Bloodsucking leech" puts 100,000 servers at risk of potent attacks

Nope.

   At least 100,000 Internet-connected servers sold by Dell, HP, and other
   large manufacturers contain hardware that is vulnerable to potent
   remote hack attacks that steal passwords and install malware on their
   host systems, researchers said.

   The threat stems from baseboard management controllers that are
   embedded onto the motherboards of most servers. Widely known as BMCs,
   the microcontrollers allow administrators to monitor the physical
   status of large fleets of servers, including their temperatures, disk
   and memory performance, and fan speeds. But serious design flaws in the
   underlying [11]intelligent platform management interface, or IPMI, make
   BMCs highly susceptible to hacks that can cascade throughout a network,
   according to a paper presented at this week's [12]Usenix Workshop on
   Offensive Technologies.

   Heightening the risk, a recent Internet scan detected at least 100,000
   IPMI-enabled servers running on publicly accessible addresses, despite
   long-standing admonitions from security professionals never to do so.

   "IPMI can be a convenient administrative tool, but under the control of
   attackers, it can also serve as a powerful backdoor," the scientists
   from the University of Michigan wrote in the paper, which was titled
   [13]Illuminating the Security Issues Surrounding Lights-out Server
   Management. "Attackers who take control of the BMC can use it to attack
   the host system and network in a variety of ways."

"Parasitic server"

   One possibility, the paper continued, is the installation of
   BMC-resident spyware that captures administrative passwords when an
   operator remotely accesses a host server. Another scenario: attackers
   could gain unfettered "root" access to the host by remotely booting the
   server into recovery mode. Worse yet, attackers could abuse vulnerable
   BMCs to run an unauthorized operating system on the host that gives raw
   access to the server disks.

   The researchers aren't the first to warn of the threats posed by widely
   used IPMI and BMC technologies. Last month, Dan Farmer, the highly
   regarded white-hat hacker, posted his [14]own manifesto that used even
   stronger language to describe the lurking danger. At one point he
   wrote:

     Imagine trying to secure a computer with a small but powerful
     parasitic server on its motherboard; a bloodsucking leech that can't
     be turned off and has no documentation; you can't login, patch, or
     fix problems on it; server-based defensive, audit, or anti-malware
     software can't be used for protection; its design is secret,
     implementation old, and it can fully control the computer's hardware
     and software; and it shares passwords with a bunch of other
     important servers, stores them in clear text for attackers to
     access.

   HD Moore, chief research officer of security firm Rapid7 and chief
   architect of the Metasploit project used by penetration testers and
   hackers, provides an equally bleak security assessment of IPMI and BMC
   [15]here.

   BMCs contain different names and specifications depending on the server
   they're bundled with, and there's little public material documenting
   their inner workings. But because each runs the same IMPI protocol,
   they're all believed to be susceptible to the same threats. The
   University of Michigan researchers tested this hypothesis by selecting
   one such controller, which came embedded on the Super X9SCL-F
   motherboard of a Supermicro SYS-5017C-LF 1U rack-mounted server. After
   performing a thorough analysis of the device, the scientists found that
   its firmware (designed by a firm called ATEN Technology) contained
   "numerous textbook security flaws, including exploitable privilege
   escalation, shell injection, and buffer overflow vulnerabilities." The
   researchers developed proof-of-concept attack code that exploited the
   vulnerabilities to remotely obtain root access on the BMC. (Supermicro
   has since [16]issued BMC firmware updates that fix some or all of the
   vulnerabilities.)

   They went on to catalog a list of attack scenarios malicious hackers
   could mount when exploiting the bugs. They included:
     * Subverting the host system or other machines on the management
       network
     * Installing BMC spyware that eavesdrops on remote management
       sessions to sniff passwords or even the physical server console
     * Installing persistent BMC rootkits that provide attackers with
       backdoor access that remains hidden from IPMI logs
     * The creation of IPMI botnets to take advantage of the large amount
       of network bandwidth at their disposal

   In all, the scientists detected more than 100,000 Internet-exposed IMPI
   devices, 40,000 of which used the Supermicro BMC they tested at length.

   "We conservatively estimate that it would take less than an hour to
   launch successful parallel attacks against all of the 40,000 ATEN-based
   Supermicro IPMI devices that we observed listening on public IP
   addresses," they reported.

Either incompetence or indifference

   The paper includes a list of defenses that should be required reading
   for anyone who administers a server anywhere. Suggestions include
   keeping IPMI firmware up to date, changing default passwords, and
   never, ever running IPMI devices on public IP addresses. This last
   admonition is widely repeated--often by the manufacturers of the
   servers that are put at risk by the vulnerabilities. The scientists'
   Internet scans provide convincing evidence that this advice is
   frequently ignored, so unfortunately, it's worth repeating often.

   But the researchers also take engineers at original equipment
   manufacturers (OEMs) to task for, among other things, building devices
   that have IPMI capabilities turned on by default. The researchers go on
   to direct some harsh words at the people developing IPMI devices and
   the servers they go into.

   "Given the power that IPMI provides, the blatant textbook
   vulnerabilities we found in a widely used implementation suggest either
   incompetence or indifference towards customers' security," the paper
   states. "While some OEMs recommend helpful precautions such as
   dedicated management networks, this should not be an excuse to shift
   blame to users who fail to heed this advice and suffer damage because
   of vulnerabilities in IPMI firmware. We believe that properly securing
   IPMI will require OEMs to take a defense-in-depth approach that
   combines hardening the implementations with encouraging users to
   properly isolate devices."

       On Supermicro X9SCM-F/X9SCL-F/X9SCL+-F series, you can:
       - disable BMC on motherboard (jumper)
       - disable BMC in BIOS
       - render IPMI unusable by entering bogus network config on the BMC
       - configure IP ACLs into BMC to limit access.
       Best choice if you want IPMI over internet is to use the dedicated
       eth port if available, configure a dedicated vlan, use a firewall
       and/or VPN in front of that vlan.
       If you can, of course, use private IP address and don't use IPMI
       over internet.
