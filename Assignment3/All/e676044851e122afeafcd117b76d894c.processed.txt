7 Things You Can Do to Support Redefining Realness

1. PRE-ORDER THE BOOK

   Pre-order your copy on [13]Amazon, [14]B&N, or [15]iBooks. Pre-order
   sales are vital to a first-time author like me. It shows my publisher
   and major booksellers that there are readers who believe in Redefining
   Realness (the first popular press-backed books about the experiences of
   a young trans woman of color) and its empowering message of
   authenticity, self-determination and love.

2. TELL A FRIEND

   One of my all-time favorite gifts is a good story. Recommend Redefining
   Realness and/or pre-order a copy of the book for someone you know will
   read it and love it. Storysharing is the gift that continues to give.

Publisher's description of Redefining Realness

   In a landmark book, an extraordinary young woman recounts her
   coming-of-age as a transgender teen--a deeply personal and empowering
   portrait of self-revelation, adversity, and heroism.

   In 2011, [19]Marie Claire magazine published a profile of Janet Mock in
   which she publicly stepped forward for the first time as a trans woman.
   Since then, Mock has gone from covering the red carpet for People.com
   to advocating for all those who live within the shadows of society.
   Redefining Realness offers a bold new perspective on being young,
   multiracial, economically challenged, and trans in America.

   Welcomed into the world as her parents' firstborn son, Mock set out
   early on to be her own person -- no simple feat for a young person like
   herself. She struggled as the smart, determined child in a deeply
   loving, yet ill-equipped family that lacked money, education, and
   resources. Mock had to navigate her way through her teen years without
   parental guidance but luckily with a few close friends and mentors she
   overcame extremely daunting hurdles.

   This powerful memoir follows Mock's quest for identity, from her early
   gender conviction to a turbulent adolescence in Honolulu that found her
   transitioning through the halls of her school, self-medicating with
   hormones at fifteen, and flying across the world for sex reassignment
   surgery at just eighteen. Ever resilient, Mock emerged with a
   scholarship to college and moved to New York City, where she earned her
   masters degree, basked in the success of an enviable career, and told
   no one about her past.

   It wasn't until Mock fell for a man who called her the woman of his
   dreams that she felt ready to finally tell her story, becoming a fierce
   advocate for girls like herself. A profound statement of affirmation
   from a courageous woman, Redefining Realness shows as never before what
   it means to be a woman today and how to be yourself when you don't fit
   the mold created for you.
