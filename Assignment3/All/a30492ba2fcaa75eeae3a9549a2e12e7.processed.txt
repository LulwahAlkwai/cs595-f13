[5]The Reinvention of the Self

   Brain & Behavior / by Jonah Lehrer /

   Elizabeth Gould overturned one of the central tenets of neuroscience.
   Now she's building on her discovery to show that poverty and stress may
   not just be symptoms of society, but bound to our anatomy.

   Elizabeth Gould Photography by Reynard Li

   Professor Elizabeth Gould has a picture of a marmoset on her computer
   screen. Marmosets are a new world monkey, and Gould has a large colony
   living just down the hall. Although her primate population is barely
   three years old, Gould is clearly smitten, showing off these
   photographs like a proud parent. Marmosets are the ideal experimental
   animal: a primate brain trapped inside the body of a rat. They
   recognize themselves in the mirror, form elaborate dominance
   hierarchies and raise their young cooperatively. If you can look past
   their rodent-like stature and punkish pompadour, marmosets can seem
   disconcertingly human.

   In her laboratory at [10]Princeton University's Department of
   Psychology, Gould is determined to create a marmoset environment that
   takes full advantage of their innate intelligence. She doesn't believe
   in metal cages. "We are housing our marmosets in large, enriched
   enclosures," she says, "and with a variety of objects to support
   foraging. These are social animals, and it's important to let them be
   social. Basically, we want to bring our experimental conditions closer
   to the wild."

   But Gould is not a primatologist. She doesn't give her marmosets
   adorable names, or spend time cuddling with their young. In fact, these
   marmosets don't even know she exists: Gould prefers to observe them
   remotely, on a little video screen. Staring at the televised frenzy of
   this little marmoset world, it is poignant to know how their lives will
   end. Their brains will be cut into thousands of transparent slices.
   Their dissected neurons will be stained neon green and the density of
   their dendritic connections will be quantified under a powerful
   microscope. They will live on as data.

   The naturalistic habitat that Gould has created for these marmosets is
   essential to her studies, which involve understanding how the
   environment affects the brain. Eight years after Gould defied the
   entrenched dogma of her science and proved that the primate brain is
   always creating new neurons, she has gone on to demonstrate an even
   more startling fact: The structure of our brain, from the details of
   our dendrites to the density of our hippocampus, is incredibly
   influenced by our surroundings. Put a primate under stressful
   conditions, and its brain begins to starve. It stops creating new
   cells. The cells it already has retreat inwards. The mind is
   disfigured.

   The social implications of this research are staggering. If boring
   environments, stressful noises, and the primate's particular slot in
   the dominance hierarchy all shape the architecture of the brain--and
   Gould's team has shown that they do--then the playing field isn't
   level. Poverty and stress aren't just an idea: they are an anatomy.
   Some brains never even have a chance.

   Viewed through the magnified eyes of a confocal microscope, a newborn
   neuron looks fragile, almost lonely. Everything around it is connected
   to everything else, but the new cell is all alone, just a seed of soma
   and a thin stalk of axon desperately trying to plug itself into the
   network. If it doesn't, it will die. Staring at this tenuous neuron, it
   is hard to believe that so much depends upon its presence.

   Dr. Gould insists on being called Liz. She wears faded jeans to work
   and ties back her long dark hair in a loose braid. She smiles easily,
   and intersperses discussions of marmoset families with stories about
   her own children. Gould doesn't talk about her research in listless
   sentences full of acronyms. Instead, she takes you through the
   experimental process, confessing all the difficulties and ambiguities
   along the way.

   Gould's casual air conceals a necessary tenaciousness: It is not easy
   to shift a paradigm. Four days after giving birth to her third child,
   Gould was back at work, lecturing to a room full of undergraduates. She
   has always worked long hours, and expects nothing less of her
   employees. (Saturdays in the Gould lab are indistinguishable from
   Mondays.) And even though her research has set off a frenzy of
   activity--neurogenesis is now one of the hottest topics in
   neuroscience--Gould has managed to remain at the cutting edge of the
   field she helped to
   invent.

   For such a high-profile scientist, Gould's lab at Princeton is
   surprisingly small. Lavishly outfitted (she has her own $400,000
   confocal microscope and large marmoset colony) the lab consists of just
   two post-docs and two grad students. They are a close knit group, and
   work on overlapping problems. "When I first began at Princeton," Gould
   says, "I had tunnel vision. I was just so determined to answer my
   critics and prove that adult neurogenesis was real. But now I'm finally
   able to think about neurogenesis in a broader context. We are free to
   figure out what all these new cells actually do."

   To understand how neurogenesis--the process of creating new brain
   cells-- works, Gould's lab studies the effect of two separate
   variables: stress and enriched environments. Chronic stress,
   predictably enough, decreases neurogenesis. As Christian Mirescu, one
   of Gould's post-docs, put it, "When a brain is worried, it's just
   thinking about survival. It isn't interested in investing in new cells
   for the future."

   On the other hand, enriched animal environments--enclosures that
   simulate the complexity of a natural habitat--lead to dramatic
   increases in both neurogenesis and the density of neuronal dendrites,
   the branches that connect one neuron to another. Complex surroundings
   create a complex brain.

   Gould's field is a new one. Only a decade ago, the idea that the
   primate brain is constantly creating new neurons, and that these new
   neurons are not only functional but responsive to changes in the
   environment, was unimaginable. Indeed, the fact that neurogenesis did
   not exist was one of modern neuroscience's founding principles. This
   theory, first articulated by Santiago Ramón y Cajal at the start of the
   20th century, held that brain cells--unlike every other cell in our
   body--don't divide. They don't die, and they are never reborn. We
   emerge from the womb with the only brain we will ever have.

   The most convincing modern defender of this theory was Pasko Rakic, the
   chairman of [11]Yale University's neurobiology department and among the
   most respected neuroscientists of his generation. In the early 1980s,
   Rakic realized that neurogenesis had never been properly tested in
   primates. He set out to investigate. Rakic studied 12 rhesus monkeys,
   injecting them with radioactively-labeled thymidine which allowed him
   to trace the development of neurons in the brain. Rakic then killed the
   monkeys at various stages after the injection of the thymidine, and
   searched for any signs of new neurons. There were none.

   "All neurons of the rhesus monkey brain are generated during pre-natal
   and early post-natal life," Rakic wrote in his 1985 paper, "Limits of
   Neurogenesis in Primates." "Not a single" new neuron "was observed in
   the brain of any adult animal." While Rakic admitted that his proof was
   limited, he persuasively defended the dogma. He even went so far as to
   construct a plausible evolutionary theory as to why neurons can't
   divide: Rakic imagined that at some point in our distant past, primates
   had traded the ability to give birth to new neurons for the ability to
   retain plasticity in our old neurons. According to Rakic, the "social
   and cognitive" behavior of primates required the absence of
   neurogenesis. His paper, with its thorough demonstration of what
   everyone already believed, seemed like the final word on the matter. No
   one bothered to verify his findings.

   The genius of the scientific method, however, is that it accepts no
   permanent solution. Skepticism is its solvent, for every theory is
   imperfect. Scientific facts are meaningful precisely because they are
   ephemeral, because a new observation, a more honest observation, can
   always alter them. This is what happened to Rakic's theory of the fixed
   brain. It was, to use Karl Popper's verb, falsified.
