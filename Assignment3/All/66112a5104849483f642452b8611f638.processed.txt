   Qualcomm, Nissan, Samsung: Two Rights and a Wrong in Smartwatches
   I think both Nissan and Qualcomm got the Smartwatch idea right.
   Qualcomm focused on making the device an extension of the Smartphone
   and it is a showcase of several key Qualcomm technologies. Nissan
   focused on making it an extension of their brand so that car owners
   would be motivated to talk about and connect to others through the
   watch increasing brand loyalty. Samsung tossed every technology but the
   kitchen sink in theirs and killed battery life in the process. Why I
   understand why they did this, largely because they don't have Apple to
   copy, I think it is a really bad strategy and this product may well
   become their Zune. Full column in Wearable Tech this week:
