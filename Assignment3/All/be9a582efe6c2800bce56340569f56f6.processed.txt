   The Unexotic Underclass

   May 19, 2013

   The startup scene today, and by `scene' I'm sweeping a fairly catholic
   brush over a large swath of people - observers, critics,  investors,
   entrepreneurs, `want'repreneurs, academics, techies, and the like -
   seems to be riven into two camps.

   On one side stand those who believe that entrepreneurs have stopped
   chasing and solving Big Problems - capital B, capital P: clean energy,
   poverty, famine, climate change, you name it.  I needn't replay their
   song here; they've argued their cases far more eloquently
   [26]elsewhere.  In short, they contend that too many brains and dollars
   have been shoveled into resolving what I call `anti-problems' -
   interests usually centered about food or fashion or `social'or gaming.
   Something an anti-problem company  might develop is an app  that
   provides  restaurant recommendations based on your blood type, a
   picture of your childhood pet, the music preferences of your 3 best
   friends, and the barometric pressure of the nearest city beginning with
   the letter Q.  (That such an app does not yet exist is reminder still
   of how impoverished a state American scientific education has
   descended.  Weep not! We redouble our calls for more STEM funding.)

   On  the other side stand those who believe that entrepreneurs have
   stopped chasing and solving Big Problems - capital B, capital P - that
   there are too many folks resolving anti-problems... BUT  just to be on
   the safe side, the venture capitalists should keep pumping tons of
   money  into  those anti-problem entrepreneurs because you never know
   when some corporate leviathan - Google, Facebook, Yahoo! - will come
   along and buy what yesterday looked like a nonsense app and today is
   still a nonsense app, but a nonsense app that can walk a bit taller,
   held aloft by the insanities of American exceptionalism.  For not only
   is our sucker birthrate still high in this country (one every minute,
   baby!), but our suckers are capitalists bearing fat checks.

   On the other other side, a side that receives scant attention, scanter
   investment, is where big problems - little b, little p - reside.  Here,
   you'll find a group I'll refer to as the unexotic underclass.  It's
   rather quiet in these parts, except during campaign season when the
   politicians stop by to scrape anecdotes off the skin of someone else's
   suffering.  Let's see who's here.

   To your left are single mothers, 80% of whom, according to the US
   Census,  are poor or hovering on the nasty edges of working poverty.
   They are struggling to raise their kids in a country that seems to
   conspire against  any semblance of proper rearing: a lack of
   flexibility in the workplace; a lack of free or affordable after-school
   programs;  an abysmal public education system where a testing-mad,
   criminally-deficient curriculum is taught during a too-short school
   day; an inescapable lurid wallpaper of sex and violence that covers
   every surface of  society;  a cultural disregard for intelligence,
   empathy and respect;  a cultural imperative to look hot, spend money
   and own the latest "it"-device (or should I say i-device) no matter
   what it costs, no matter how little money Mum may have.

   Slightly to the right, are your veterans of two ongoing wars in the
   Middle East. Wait, we're at war?   Some of these veterans, having
   served multiple tours, are returning from combat with all manner of
   monstrosities ravaging their heads and bodies.  If that weren't enough,
   welcome back, dear vets, to a flaccid economy, where your military
   training makes you invisible to an invisible hand that rewards only
   those of us who are young and  expensively educated.

   Welcome back to a 9-month wait for medical benefits.  According to
   investigative reporter Aaron Glantz, who was embedded in Iraq, and has
   now authored The War Comes Home: Washington's Battle against America's
   Veterans, 9 months is the average amount of time  a veteran waits for
   his or her disability claim to be processed after having filed their
   paperwork.  And by `filed their paperwork,' I mean it literally:
   veterans are sending bundles of papers to some bureaucratic Dantean
   capharnaum run by the Department of Veterans' Affairs,  where, by its
   own admission, it processes 97%  of its claims by hand, stacking them
   in heaps on tables and in cabinets.

   In the past 5 years, the number of vets who've died before their claim
   has even been processed has tripled. This is America in 2013: 40 years
   ago we put a man on the moon; today a young lady in New York can use
   anti-problem technology if she wishes  to line up a date this Friday
   choosing only from men who are taller than 6 feet, graduated from an
   Ivy, live within 10 blocks of Gramercy, and play tennis left-handed...

   ...And yet, veterans who've returned from Afghanistan and Iraq have to
   wait roughly 270 days (up to 600 in New York and California) to receive
   the help -- medical, moral, financial - which they urgently need, to
   which they are honorably entitled, after having fought our battles
   overseas.

   Technology, indeed, is solving the right problems.

   Let's keep walking.  Meet the people who have the indignity of being
   over 50 and finding themselves suddenly jobless.  These are the
   Untouchables of the new American workforce: 3+ decades of employment
   and experience have disqualified them from ever seeing a regular salary
   again.   Once upon a time, some modicum of employer noblesse oblige
   would have ensured that loyal older workers be retained or at the very
   least retrained, MBA advice be damned.  But, "A bas les vieux!" the
   fancy consultants cried, and out went those who were  `no longer
   fresh.'  As Taylor Swift would put it, corporate America and the Boomer
   worker  "are never ever getting back together."  Instead bring in the
   young, the childless, the tech-savvy here in America, and the underpaid
   and quasi-indentured abroad willing to work for slightly north of
   nothing in the kinds of conditions we abolished in the 19^th century.

   For, in the 21^st century, a prosperous American business is a soaring
   2-storied cake: 1 management layer at top thick with perks, golden
   parachutes, stock options, and a total disregard for those beneath
   them; 1 layer below of increasingly foreign workers (If you're lucky,
   you trained these people before you were laid off!), who can't even
   depend on their jobs because as we speak, those sameself consultants -
   but no one that we know of course -- are scouring the globe for the
   cheapest labor opportunities, fulfilling their promise that no CEO be
   left behind.

   Above all of this, the frosting on the cake,  the nec plus ultra of
   evolutionary corporate accomplishment: the Director of Social Media.
   This is the 20-year old whose role it is to "leverage social media to
   deliver a seamless authentic experience across multiple digital streams
   to strategic partners and communities."  In other words, this person
   gets paid six figures to send out tweets. But again, no one that we
   know.

   Time and space and my own sheltered upbringing  defend me from giving
   you the whole tour of the unexotic underclass, but trust that it is
   big, and only getting bigger.

   ___________________________________

   Now, why the heck should any one care? Especially a young
   entrepreneur-to-be.  Especially a young entrepreneur-to-be whose
   trajectory of nonstop success has placed him or her leagues above the
   unexotic underclass.  You should care because the unexotic underclass
   can help address one of the biggest inefficiencies plaguing  the
   startup scene right now: the flood of  (ostensibly) smart, ambitious
   young people desperate to be entrepreneurs; and the embarrassingly
   idea-starved landscape where too many smart people are chasing too many
   dumb ideas, because they have none of their own (or, because  they
   suspect no one will invest in what they really want to do).  The
   unexotic underclass has big problems, maybe not the Big Problems -
   capital B, capital P - that get `discussed' at Davos.  But they have
   problems nonetheless, and where there are problems, there are markets.

   The space  that caters to my demographic - the cushy 20 and
   30-something urbanites - is oversaturated. It's not rocket science:
   people build what they know.  Cosmopolitan, well-educated young men and
   women in America's big cities are rushing into startups and building
   for other cosmopolitan well-educated young men and women in big
   cities.  If you need to plan a trip, book a last minute hotel room ,
   get your nails done, find a date, get laid, get an expert shave, hail a
   cab, buy clothing, borrow clothing, customize clothing, and share the
   photos instantly, you have Hipmunk, HotelTonight, Manicube, OKCupid,
   Grindr, Harry's, Uber, StyleSeek, Rent the Runway, eshakti/Proper Cloth
   and Instagram respectively to help you. These companies are good, with
   solid brains behind them, good teams and good funding.

   But there are only so many suit customisation, makeup sampling, music
   streaming, social eating, discount shopping, experience  curating
   companies that the market can bear.  If you're itching to start
   something  new, why chase the n^th  iteration of a company already
   serving the young, privileged, liberal jetsetter? If you're an
   investor, why revisit the same space as everyone else?  There is life,
   believe me, outside of NY, Cambridge, Chicago, Atlanta, Austin, L.A.
   and San Fran.

   It's where the unexotic underclass lives.  It's called America.  This
   underclass is not some obscure niche market.  Take the single mothers.
   Per the US Census Bureau, there are 10 million of them  today; and an
   additional 2 million single fathers.  Of the single mothers, the
   majority is White, 1 in 4 is Hispanic, and 1 in 3 is Black.  So this is
   a fairly large and diverse group.

   Take the veterans. (I will beat the veteran drum to death.) According
   to the VA's latest figures, there are roughly 23 million vets in the
   United States.  That number sounds disturbingly high; that's almost 1
   in 10 Americans.  Entrepreneurs and investors like big numbers.  Other
   groups you could include in the underclass: ex-convicts, many
   imprisoned for petty drug offenses, many released for crimes they never
   even committed.  How does an ex-convict get back into society?  And
   navigate not just freedom, but a transformed technological landscape?
   Another group, and this one seems to sprout in pockets of affluence:
   people with food allergies.  Some parents today resort to putting
   shirts and armbands on their kids indicating what foods they can or
   can't eat.  Surely there's a better fix for that?

   Maybe you could fix that.

   ___________________________________

   Why do I call this underclass unexotic?  Because, those of us, lucky
   enough to be raised in comfortable environs - well-schooled,
   well-loved, well-fed - are aware of only 2 groups: those at the very
   bottom and those at the very top.

   We have clear notions of what the ruling class resembles - its wealth,
   its connections, its interests.  Some of you reading this will probably
   be part of the ruling class before you know it.  Some of you probably
   already are.  For the 1% aspirants (and there's no harm in having such
   aspirations), hopefully by the time you get there, you will have found
   meaningful problems to solve - be they big, or Big.

   We have clear ideas of what the exotic underclass looks like because
   everyone is clamoring to help them.  The exotic underclass are people
   who live in the emerging and third world countries that happen to be in
   fashion now -- Kenya, Bangladesh, Brazil, South Africa. The  exotic
   underclass are poor Black and Hispanic children (are there any other
   kind?) living in America's urban ghettos.  The exotic underclass suffer
   from diseases that have stricken the rich and famous, and therefore
   benefit from significant attention and charity.

   On the other hand, the unexotic underclass, has the misfortune of being
   insufficiently interesting.  These are the huddles of Whites - poor,
   rural working class - living in the American South, in the Midwest, in
   Appalachia.  In oh-so-progressive Northeast, we  refer to them as
   `hicks' and `hillbillies' and `trailer trash,' because apparently, this
   is the one demographic that American manners have forgotten.

   The unexotic underclass are the poor in Eastern Europe, and Central
   Asia, who just don't look foreign enough for our taste.  Anyone who's
   lived in a major European city can attest to the ubiquity of desperate
   Roma families, arriving from Bulgaria and Romania, panhandling in the
   streets and on the subways. This past April, the employees of the
   Louvre Museum in Paris went on strike because they were tired of being
   pickpocketed by hungry Roma children.   But if you were to go to
   Bulgaria to volunteer or to start a social enterprise, how would the
   folks back on Facebook know you were helping `the poor?'  if the poor
   in your pictures kind of looked like you?

   And of course, the biggest block of the unexotic underclass are the
   ones I alluded to earlier: that vast, suffocating mass right here in in
   America. We don't notice them because they don't get by on $1 a day. We
   don't talk about them because they don't make $1 billion a year.  The
   only place where they're popular is in Washington, D.C. where President
   Obama and  his colleagues in Congress can can use members of the
   underclass to spice up their stump speeches: "Yesterday, I met a
   struggling family out in yadda yadda yadda..." But there's only so much
   Washington can do to help out, what with government penniless and
   gridlocked, and its elected officials occupying a caste of selfishness,
   cowardice and spite, heretofore unseen in American politics.

   __________________________________

   If you're an entrepreneur looking for ideas, consider looking beyond
   the city-centric, navel-gazing, youth-obsessed mainstream.  That
   doesn't mean you need to fly to the end of the world.  Chances are
   there are more people addressing the Big Problems of slum dwellers in
   Calcutta, Kibera or Rio, than are tackling the big problems of
   hardpressed folks in say, West Virginia, Mississippi or Louisiana.

   To be clear, I'm not painting the American South as the primary
   residence of all the wretched of the earth. You will meet people down
   there who are just as intelligent and cultured and affluent as we
   pretend everyone up North is.

   Second, I'm not pitting the unexotic against the exotic.  There is
   nothing easy or trendy about the work being done by the brave
   innovators on the ground in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  Some
   examples of that work: [27]One Earth Designs which helps deliver clean
   energy and heating solutions to communities in rural China;
   [28]Sanergy, which is bringing low-cost sanitation to Kenya's poorest
   slums;  [29]Samasource, which provides contract work to youth and women
   in Haiti, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and India.  These are young startups
   with young entrepreneurs who attended the same fancy schools we all
   know and love (MIT, Harvard, Yale, etc.), who lived in the same big
   cities where we all congregate, and worked in the same fancy jobs we
   all flocked to post-graduation.  Yet, they decided they would go out
   and  tackle Big Problems - capital B, capital P. We need to encourage
   them, even if we could never imitate them.

   If we can't imitate them ,and we're not ready for the challenges of the
   emerging market, and we have no new ideas to offer, then maybe there
   are problems, right here in America for us to solve...The problems of
   the unexotic underclass.

   ____________________________________

   Now, I can already hear the screeching of meritocratic,  Horatio
   Algerian Silicon Valley,

   "What do we have to do with any of this? The unexotic underclass has to
   pull itself up by its own bootstraps!  Let them learn to code and build
   their own startups!  What we need are more ex-convicts turned
   entrepreneurs, single mothers turned programmers, veterans turned
   venture capitalists!

   The road out of welfare is paved with computer science!!!"

   Yes, of course.

   There's nothing wrong with the entrepreneurship-as-salvation gospel.
   Nothing wrong with teaching more people to code.  But it's impractical
   in the short term, and misses the greater point in the long term:   We
   shouldn't live in a universe of solipsistic startups...  where I start
   a company and produce things only for myself and for people who
   resemble me.  Let's be honest.  Very few of us are members of this
   unexotic underclass.  Very few of us even know anyone who's  in it.
   There's no shame in that.  That we have  sailed on a yacht of good
   fortune most of our lives -- supportive generous families, a stable
   peaceful democracy, excellent schooling, prestigious careers and
   companies, relatively good health - is nothing to be ashamed of.
   Consider yourselves remarkably blessed.

   What is shameful though, is that in a country with so many problems,
   with such a heaving underclass, we find the so-called `best and
   brightest,' the 20-and 30-somethings who emerge from the top American
   graduate and undergraduate programs, abandoning their former
   hangout,Wall Street, to pile into anti-problem entrepreneurship.

   Look, I worked for Goldman Sachs immediately after graduating from
   Wellesley. After graduating from MIT, I worked at a hedge fund. I am
   not throwing stones.   Here in hell, the stones wouldn't reach you
   anyhow... If you're under 30 and in finance, you've definitely noticed
   the radical migration of your peers from Wall Street to Silicon Valley
   and Silicon Alley.   This should have been a good exchange.  When I
   first entered banking, leftist hippie that I was (and still am), my
   biggest issue was what struck me as a kind of gross intellectual
   malpractice:  how could so many bright historians and economists,
   athletes and engineers, writers and biogeneticists, from every great
   school you could think of - Princeton, Berkeley, Oxford, Harvard,
   Imperial, Caltech, Amherst, Wharton, Yale, Swarthmore, Cambridge, and
   so on -- be concentrated into a single sector, working obscene hours at
   a sweatshop to manufacture money?

   When I look at the bulk of startups today - while  there are notable
   exceptions (Code for America for example, which invites
   local governments to request technology help from teams of coders) - it
   doesn't seem like we've aspired to something nobler: it just looks like
   we've shifted the malpractice from feeding the money machine to making
   inane, self-centric apps. Worse,  is that the power players,
   institutional and individual -- the highflying VCs, the
   entrepreneurship incubators, the top-ranked MBA programs, the
   accelerators, the universities,  the business plan competitions have
   been complicit in this nonsense.

   Those who are entrepreneurially-minded but young and idea-poor need
   serious direction from those who are rich in capital and connections.
   We see what ideas are getting funded, we see money flowing like the
   river Ganges towards insipid me-too products, so is it crazy that we've
   been thinking small?  building smaller? that our "blood and judgment"
   to quote Hamlet, have not been  "so well commingled?"

   We need someone bold (and older than us) to stand up for Big Problems
   which are tough and dirty.  But what we especially need is someone to
   stand up for big problems - little b, little p -which are tough and
   dirty and too easy to overlook.

   We need:

   A Ron Conway, a Fred Wilson-type at the venture level to say, `Kiddies,
   basta with this bull*%!..  This year we're only investing in companies
   targeting the unexotic underclass."

   A Paul Graham and his Y Combinator at the incubator level, to devote
   one season to the underclass, be it veterans, single moms or overworked
   young doctors, Native Americans, the list is long:  "Help these
   entrepreneurs build something that will help you."

   The head of an MIT or an HBS or a Stanford Law at the academic level,
   to tell the entire incoming class: "You are lucky to be some of the
   best engineering and business and law students, not just in the
   country, but in the world.  And as an end-of-year project, you are
   going to use that talent to develop products, policy and programs to
   help lift the underclass."

   Of the political class, I ask nothing.  With a vigor one would have
   thought inaccessible to people at such an age, our leaders in
   Washington have found ever innovative ways to avoid solving the
   problems that have been brought before them.  Playing brinkmanship
   games with filibusters and fiscal cliffs;  taking money to avoid taking
   votes.  They are entrepreneurs of the highest order: presented with 1
   problem, they manage to create 5 more. They have demonstrated that
   government is not only not the answer, it is the anti-answer...

   The dysfunction in D.C. is a big problem.

   Entrepreneurs: it looks like there's work for you there too...

       Brilliant! I especially like the line: "basta with this bull*%!" It
       would be nice if we could collectively send the same message to
       Washington.

            As a part of this so-called "unexotic underclass" (53 yr. old
            female who has resorted to being a nanny after all the jobs in
            my career disappeared-I was a state park naturalist in
            California)--I am reminded of the lyrics of the old Steely Dan
            song (yeah-I'm old) "Showbiz Kids"
            "Show business kids making movies of themselves,
            You know they don't give a fuck about anybody else...."
            Somehow, I doubt these new showbiz kids will listen,
            well-written and well-meaning as this essay is. They just
            don't see the money in doing anything for folks like me. And
            that's what REALLY counts these days, isn't it?
            I somehow feel I'm stuck caring for their own uber-priviledged
            children until I am old enough to collect Social Security-if
            that exists by then.
            So it goes...

                 Brigit, you bring up a good point. I am unemployed again
                 after my 3rd layoff in 4 years in the insurance industry,
                 and this with a CPCU, AIC, Bachelors' and part of a
                 Master's degree. I'm the new "overqualfiied" and being
                 over 40, we're getting lumped in with your peers as "too
                 old" and not fresh enough. I currently volunteer on a
                 501c non profit board but going back to school....for the
                 third time...appears the only option left to me to get
                 back into the income bracket I need. Yet another career
                 change.
                 I too hope that entrepreneurs read this excellent
                 article, but your point above simply illustrates
                 something I learned while filling out survey work. Those
                 without full time, highly paid employment need not apply.
                 Why you ask?
                 No marketer wants to know what those without money want
                 to buy. Wishes are not cash.
                 Social Security will be long gone by the time I can draw
                 a check at 74. Good luck.

            This is a good article, but it fits the classic "why are
            people doing B when they should be doing A?" theme. A critique
            is easy, but understanding the underlying phenomenon is
            significantly more challenging. Policy wonks in DC should be
            focusing on this, but they are more than content with printing
            dollars and starting wars.
            The question is why people are focusing on non-problems (B)
            instead of big problems (A)? The reason is government policy.
            Free trade agreements have shipped American jobs overseas and
            are increasing our deficits. Initially it was lucrative to
            move to the financial/service industry, but over time
            technical know-how has eroded. That limits our ability to
            tackle A.
            To get people back to working on big-problems will take 10-20
            years after we install a policy of "zero" trade deficit
            (probably not going to happen). We as a society have to move
            from asking for "cheap" to asking for "better". It is not easy
            as "cheap" is quantifiable, but "better" is not. So next time
            you go to Walmart to buy cheap junk....DON'T. This small act
            will eventually ensure that future generations will work on
            big-problems, but it requires that you work on this little
            problem of "cheap" v/s "good".

                 I think you're on the right track in your second
                 paragraph, and agree.
                 My take, Re: `...why arene't we...Gov't Policy..." is
                 that we've reached some sort of collective psychosis
                 where the group of pressing `big B, big P' has
                 outstripped our talent and ability to approach, tackle,
                 manage and govern in any kind of time frame which will
                 not yield extreme (subjective) discomfort to everyone,
                 everywhere, including the worlds 1%. We can't solve these
                 issues in `programmer's time' (you know, where every
                 smart person solves an issue `in 5 minutes'). I do think
                 the programmer culture/cult-or-smartness of the last 30
                 years has had an corrosive effect on the ability of the
                 recent tech and engineering classes to think long term.
                 "It can't be solved in 10 minutes or less according to my
                 STEM mind-training and/or I'll never be able to cash in
                 on THIS quickly, so eff it, why should I bother".

       Pretty beautiful, hot on the heels of the "White Savior Industrial
       Complex."
       Most noteworthy to me, working on richer and better ways of (making
       a) living, in terms of human happiness as well as ecological
       connections: the "ecology of happiness" is an area where "big
       problems" and "Big Problems" overlap, and where progress has been
       hampered so badly exactly because the unexotic underclass has also
       been overlooked.
       Thus, they seemed to be left by the wayside, if not negatively
       impacted, by any calls for the ecologically better... even as the
       (un)exotic underclass sees the best ways forward in trying to
       follow in the footsteps of the "developed" countries/classes, and
       even as the upper classes, caught in the web of anti-problem
       navel-gazing (or, for that matter, helping "them" far away) also
       fail to see the need for - and the potential in - change...
       Meanwhile, entrepreneurial potential would be badly needed. Just,
       not for nothing but money-making, but for solving the problem of
       how to live happily while not having it cost the earth, live within
       limits - and live well.
       With all the focus on coding and apps - on technology - the
       necessity of looking at technique, at skill of living, seems to be
       hidden completely. That may be something where the "hicks" have
       something to teach the "educated," actually.
       Never have I learned more about logistics than when I spent time
       with a farmer friend trying to organize it all...

       We launched a local initiative to provide a free preschool
       education to the 49% of children in San Diego who do not currently
       receive one. I resigned from my position in the world of
       advertising and my wife left the safety of the funded preschool to
       do this. Raising any money has been difficult and we are running
       the program on our own savings.
       The programs are important and necessary, but unless others step
       over the line from marginally interested onlooker to financial
       supporter our program, like many others, will stall.

                 Even if preschool doesn't effect kid's "intelligence" by
                 middleschool those families probably also can't afford
                 daycare and preschool is effectively daycare. Free

                 No, actually, the meta-analysis shows that while the
                 amplitude of gains diminishes over time, the overall
                 effect is still significant, particularly based on
                 features like low student to teacher ratios.
                 Most of the critics of early childhood education
                 cherry-pick non-germane critiques and use them to
                 misrepresent the social science, generally to advance a
                 neoliberal agenda that opposes government intervention
                 qua intervention.

       In short. Wow! This was actually very insightful, very interesting
       and it came close to making me feel bad for what I have been able
       to accomplish in my 58 years and even worse for those things I have
       not taken the time to do. At the end of the article I find myself
       thinking of the big problems (whatever size p or b it may be) to
       help the unexotic underclass and I realize I have absolutely no
       idea. I believe it was either Albert Einstein or Thomas Edison who
       once said that given an hour to solve a problem, I would use the
       first 50 minutes to define the problem and then it would only take
       10 minutes to solve it. How do we close the gap between solving and
       defining the problem (or problems) to be solved? Without taking up
       residence in the locations identified, could it ever be done? I
       know that there are really big problems that should be solved right
       here at home for the unexotic underclass, but somehow I feel that I
       have just read an article telling me that we don't pay attention,
       and I have been left with the task of figuring it out. Sort of like
       getting a gift of a $50 down payment on a $5,000 suit. Great
       gesture, but I can't bring it home from here. I, for one, am VERY
       interested in your take on what problems I should be thinking
       about; and it needs to be more specific than hunger, homelessness,
       high drop-out rate, and high infant mortality. Those are outcomes,
       they don't define the problems to be solved. You have built a
       castle in the air, it is now time to build the foundation beneath
       it.

            Just a point of correction. You mentioned "test driving
            Teslas" in your screed against time wasters. I would hold Elon
            Musk as an example of the kind of person who has answered the
            author's call (long before she made it). Musk became a
            billionaire by co-founding Paypal, and then he could have
            taken his billions and gone chasing billions more on twitfacr
            apps or whatever, but instead decided to solve Big Problems,
            like global warming (Tesla Motors + SolarCity) and man's
            future in space (SpaceX). People have been paying lip service
            to carbon emissions for decades, but that guy's actually doing
            it. The overarching goal of Tesla Motors is cheap electric
            vehicles for everybody, and the Tesla S is just the half-way
            point. The electric drive train systems developed by Tesla are
            being sold/licensed to other automakers as well, paving the
            way for cheap electric vehicles. They're blanketing the
            country with charging stations, and eventually the dream of
            removing automobiles as a direct contributor of greenhouse gas
            emissions will be realized. Yes, the power has to come from
            somewhere, but solving problems with the electric grid is part
            of the mission of SolarCity.
            The world needs more Elon Musks.

       My dear CZ, this is most insightful and instructive not only to the

       go to the US for greener pastures. Unexotic underclass are in all
       societies and form the largest segment in "blessed fourth world

       the American predicament having become too wise for decency; women
       who marry and dirvoice at the slightest disagreement and becoming
       single mothers, men who do not understand their responsibility to
       head their families according to the role given them by God,
       breeding children who know not the defining lines between respect
       and insult and a society that have not understood the impact of
       continually voting war-hungry Republicans that believe global
       dominance can only come by becoming a bully! But I do sympathize
       with the US role also catering for most of the hungry in the globe!
       23 million vets is quite an indictment of the US foreign policy

       i totally agree with this.
       also, i'd like to see you do something to model the behavior &
       entrepreneurship you speak of, rather than just talking about it
       and assigning "needs" elsewhere. it definitely helps to identify a
       problem and do your research - "generating awareness" as they call
       it in the nonprofit world - but once you've gone that far, its time
       to get of your (butt) and actually make something happen.
       i think that too many intellectuals talk about the problems facing
       america but do nothing; there is an assumption that once you show
       that show recognition of a pervasive class issue, then that's it;
       you've done your work. someone else will read your work and do what
       needs to be done for you. but it doesn't work like that. the act of
       verbally acknowledging a problem does not automatically absolve
       someone of the responsibility of actually doing anything about it.
       just sayin.
       in the meantime, thank you for bringing this up, and i look forward
       to seeing your work in the future. pick an issue and go for it. it

       into a rite of passage for all new and upcomig entrepreneurs
       whether in the classroom or outside. The other way is to have to
       have a exit strategy that incorporates public service, if that is
       even possible. However, the market values financial achievement
       first and foremost, and social and public service has always been
       secondary at best.

       good article, I like it. rousing, literate, true, entertaining.
       I think the seed+vc financing model doesn't really take an interest
       in these kind of practical projects.
       I hope KickStarter or the next wave of crowd-funding will be a more
       efficient market to finance useful but unexotic type startups.

       You speak the truth, madame.
       The "unexotic" folks in the town I serve as a pastor -- a lot of
       them anyhow -- are struggling to get decent grades in community
       college while holding down low-paying jobs, trying to take care of
       their kiddos and avoid their abusive ex-spouses.
       They're not starving, but they don't get very good food. They have
       tolerable clothing. Their kids don't have much to do after school,
       unlike the kids from families with more money who are
       overscheduled.
       Being poor in the USA is a demanding job: dealing with
       bureaucracies (housing, transitional assistance, WIC,
       medicaid/affordable care, scholarships) is complex and unforgiving.
       Our culture can do better than we do. Actually, some tech stuff is
       doing good ... the people I know love Khan Academy and TED talks.

       Fancy talk from someone who clearly hasn't lifted a single finger
       to build a technological solution to all the things she decries. It
       seems you too are content doing what you are good at, writing,
       banking and whispering sweet nothings into the ears of would be
       entrepreneurs. Put your money where your mouth is and actually
       build something. Then when you come to me and say I need your help,
       maybe then I'll quit my cushy job and join you in your efforts to

            1. She isn't a technical person, and therefore any technical
            solutions would have to come from someone else, i.e. someone
            who isn't a total prick (obviously that doesn't include you)
            contacting her and offering to help.
            2. Why does a solution to any of these problems she wrote
            about need to be technical?
            Of course, technology is a great tool, but first we need to
            define the problem before rushing to the shop/computer to go
            build something. With this article, she has clearly defined a
            new problem for would-be entrepreneurs to solve. That right
            there is a huge leap forward. Since I'm assuming you have a
            technical background, why don't YOU go and build something?

       Wow! This is great! I love your point about "why chase the nth
       iteration of a company already serving the young, privileged,
       liberal jetsetter? If you're an investor, why revisit the same
       space as everyone else?"
       It's so true! It's ridiculous! Why, indeed? Because everyone - like
       you said VCs, universities, business plan competitions - all of
       them support it.
       I agree, I am an entrepreneur that wants to do more than code and
       would love to figure out how I can help single mothers, veterans to
       get aid faster, but I would need to be funded, and that
       unfortunately is where I think a lot of people cower. But to solve
       big problems is definitely not as easy as building a simple app
       that connects you to the best food in town, or maybe it is, it may
       just be a matter or using the simple things to help advance the
       unexotic underclass in America, plus the willpower of a few
       entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.

       It becomes a matter of economics. We build anti-problem solutions
       for the rich 20 and 30 somethings, because we know they have
       money-to-waste. We know that, because we are them. And the VCs?
       They know those people have money, and know that if they invest in
       these anti-problem solutions, some of that money will come back to
       them.
       It's one-step economics. They have money. I'll do this, and they'll
       give me that money. Then I have money. It's easy.
       The unexotic underclass don't have money- or rather, not the amount
       of money-to-waste cash that entices us to make solutions for them.
       So there is no easy one-step solution to get them to give me their
       money.
       We need to build something that (somehow) results in unexotic
       underclass having more money, and then paying some of that money to
       us for solving the problem. But since they don't have money now,
       you can't get it up-front, and since your solution might fail, you
       have a hard time convincing anyone to promise to give you money
       later.
       So if we're to solve these sorts of problems, we need solutions
       which address that deadlock. And then we need to convince a VC that
       our solution will work, that it addresses the deadlock, and that
       this little-studied-or-cared-for class of people that the VC isn't
       used to anyone marketing for will indeed respond to this solution
       in the way that we hope.
       And we can do that. I'd like to do that.
       But the choice is always between trying to solve a hard problem
       with little support, or trying to solve an easy problem with VCs
       lining up to hand you money right now. And maybe a few of us want
       to make the hard choice, but will enough of the best and brightest?

       Brilliant article. Prescient and inspiring.
       It reminds me, in part, of a quote that begins the master's course
       I teach at Indiana University's School of Informatics program in
       Interaction Design: "In the varied topography of professional
       practice, there is a high, hard ground overlooking a swamp. On the
       high ground, manageable problems lend themselves to solution
       through the application of research-based theory and technique. In
       the swampy lowland, messy, confusing problems defy technical
       solution. The irony of this situation is that the problems of the
       high ground tend to be relatively unimportant to individuals or
       society at large, however great their technical interest may be,
       while in the swamp lie the problems of greatest human concern. The
       practitioner must choose." (Donald A. Schön
       Educating the Reflective Practitioner, 1987)
       The unexotic underclass is the swamp problem of our time.

       I largely agree and it was this line of reasoning that inspired me
       to start finansavvy.com which is a site owned and operated by
       Sightful Software of which I am the founder. My thinking was that
       if you're not already well off you generally don't have access to
       objective financial planning services (not selling investment
       products). We'll see how it goes.
       I think about other ideas like this all the time. Reading your
       article I had two contrary thoughts.
       First, a lot of these topics are run by, regulated by and stifled
       by the government. For example the VA problem you describe is NOT a
       technology problem. The technology to solve their problems has been
       around for decades. In general any time you try to get into
       something where the government is involved, the regulatory barriers
       will stop you cold from doing anything worthwhile.
       Second, it's a cold hard fact of business that to survive you have
       to have customers. Paying customers. You need engineers to make the
       product, marketing people to let the people who could use it know
       it exists. Only people with money...discretionary income...can pay
       you for whatever you come up with to help them. Even an advertising
       based model would be a hard to sell...there's not a ton of money to
       be made advertising to the poor. This is not completely
       insurmountable but it is a challenge and it is also a big part of
       the reason why everyone is catering to the needs ot the haves.

       As one of the founders of a company identified in this article for
       not pursuing Big Problems, I'd like to provide a counter-argument.
       My co-founder and I were previously solving `Big Problems' like
       space travel and energy storage to enable the next wave of clean
       energy production. To be successful as an entrepreneur solving
       these types of big problems requires 1) significant industry
       expertise, 2) lots of capital, 3) higher risk tolerance, 4) time
       and patience. Starting a company is all about simplicity and speed
       to prove an idea and a business. Any added complexities in the
       sales process (due to multiple buyers, unfamiliar consumer
       segments, government, insurance, etc.), the partner network, the
       product, or any certification, and the risk and challenges increase
       exponentially. Most successful entrepreneurs today 1) solve
       problems that they are intimately familiar with and 2) require
       simple solutions. Even given these conditions 1/10 succeed. While I
       completely support the notion of tackling the Big Problems (and
       have dedicated years of my life to tackling them myself), what
       you're asking for is for first time entrepreneurs to get even
       further away from their comfort zone (they're already putting their
       personal finances, careers, and relationships on the line) to
       resolve these larger issues. Taking an HBS or MIT grad on a field
       trip to West Virginia isn't going to get them intimately familiar
       with these issues - you need to recruit people to solve these
       problems who have lived and breathed them previously. We all know
       that there are smart people who HAVE lived and breathed them, but
       the problem is getting them the tools. Instead of motivating new
       college grads from the elite schools to tackle these problems, I
       might focus the effort on successful serial entrepreneurs who tend
       to be able to take more risk and are able to solve these larger
       problems because 1) they may have already made their fortunes
       elsewhere and have an existing support network, 2) they have a
       track record and can attain capital more easily. Take Elon Musk and
       Peter Thiel for example - these two made their fortunes building
       software to allow people to pay each other, and are now tackling
       problems in space travel, automobiles, energy, etc. I would
       identify these as Big Problems. For now, I (and many others like
       me) have more than enough challenges ahead building a business
       around problems for a much more familiar audience with known
       distribution mechanisms, proven channel partners, and investors who
       also understand this market. I have a lot to learn as an
       entrepreneur before I venture back to solving problems without
       these advantages.

       Having spoken with a number of teachers and others in the helping
       professions lately, I've noted that in such careers, there is a
       degree requirement (BA at least, MA often preferred), and a cap on
       how much one can realistically make in salary. No matter how smart
       or dedicated you are. By contrast, entrepreneurs can shoot for six,
       seven or even eight figures and occasionally get there, even
       without any college. This is part of the reason why some of the
       sharpest minds end up in tech startups - it's where the money is.

       What this article lacks is a mention that the private sector works

       the government regulates it or provides some level of assistance to
       a given market, it is poison to entrepreneurs. You could come up
       with a great startup to solve some of these big problems, but if
       government decides it's politically expedient to suddenly focus on
       the problem you're solving, you're SOL.

       The underlying problem is the increasing wealth concentration in
       the US. As more of the wealth of the country shifts to the upper
       class, especially finance, so does investment ROI.
       VC's and other investors, if they want to survive, have no choice
       but shift their investment accordingly into areas where the ROI is
       - upperclass anti-problems.
       They do their pro-bono, charity work with the exotic underclass,
       where thanks to favorable exchange rates a few pennies a day can
       save lives and make outsized differences.
       But the unexotic underclass's problems are more expensive to solve,
       the population much larger, and the ROI marginal or non-existent.
       Hence, investment funneling into 1% anti-problems. The upper class
       investing in itself and profiting from itself in an increasingly
       closed loop funding system.
       The only longterm solution to this is to 1) identify the policies
       responsible for the wealth gap and reverse them, and/or 2) figure

       Incentives matter. Appealing to people's better nature is at best
       only a short-term solution, but can't overcome the long-term power
       of finanicial, economic, and policy incentives in place that funnel
       both money and talent into away from unexotic underclass problems
       to upperclass anti-problems.

            Yes! This is exactly right. And maybe some of those great
            brains in the startup community could help us create more
            effective and fair social and economic systems. Because if we
            can't find them, we are headed to society-wide repression or

       Fantastic piece. I grew up in Baltimore and thought I knew the
       unexotic underclass, we had rednecks, right? Then I moved out west,
       to rural Oregon, and while the rednecks look similar (big trucks,
       camo pants, country music) they are entirely different. Back East
       suffers from immense sprawl and even your "rural" rednecks are
       suburban. They can get to "The City," the know and befriend blacks,
       the see Chinese and Korean immigrants, they work in offices with
       cubicles. Back west Rednecks might not have jobs. The closest "big
       town" might be 20 miles away and the closest city 100 miles. Their
       dad and grandpa worked at the mill which has since closed up. They
       haven't been to any restaurant of note since last year when they
       went on vacation and ate at a Panera. They've been to the town
       library twice in their lifetime. They are not bad people but they
       are completely uncultured. They look identical to their East Coast
       peers but share little in common.

       Nice article - but instead of looking to the Ivies, why not look to
       the State Colleges (Big S, Big C) for the talented folks who are a
       smidgeon closer to the big problem (small b small p). You have to
       be able to reach your customer base and, in my experience, that's
       hard to do if you've never really touched the big problems (small
       b, small p). Those of us who figured out a way out of the big
       problems (small b, small p) might be better suited to tackle this
       than those who have spent their lives from the lofty perches
       reached by the Ivies.

       Unfortunately, many of the big problems can't be solved without

       One of the big problems here is that governments are notoriously
       hard to deal with budget-wise. The sales processes are long and
       there is always the threat that the budget item is going to get
       trimmed or even cut. Government contracts are burdensome, and there
       are always strong interests from the inside to protect existing
       processes.
       You mention the high proportion of VA forms that are processed by
       hand. Can you imagine the political backlash if they brought on
       some new technology that quickly displaced even 100 employees? Or
       that one of the existing government suppliers would not raise a
       hoot and try to offer a copycat version with less functionality
       that they could then ammend to the prior contract price?
       VCs aren't very likely to give money to an entrepreneur that starts
       out by saying, "We are going to have this really limited
       addressable market: governments." Or do you think public perception
       would be positive when you need to monitize and think, "we need to
       charge a $0.99 download fee + $3.00 monthly subscription to a
       single mother to help her manager her food stamps for the month?"

       From my point of view, the real problem is not that my generation

       beyond the problem of how to kick-start an incredibly successful
       business. The problem is that they have no heart to do it. What we

       I believe Ms. Nnaemeka nailed it right on the head. No surprise
       that she studied Philosophy. What is really concerning is the

       basically - yeah yeah we get it but what's your solution? We'll I
       don't believe anyone I've ever read has taken this approach before

       into something that is understandable for everyone to comprehend.
       We must not forget look at the dialog she opened up. I haven't seen
       so many thoughtful comments on one article. Just goes to show that
       pumping a little more time in energy into our civilizations
       philosophical foundations is where we really should focus. The fact
       that she has been able to harness this kind of energy off a
       well-written thoughtful article shows that she has provided the
       beginnings of a solution, i.e., opening our brains to the ideas
       that we need to self-reflect on our human progress. I personally
       studied philosophy and found it to be the most enriching experience
       I could have ever done for myself. I really think it is a sad state

       Given reactions showed in posts above, I'm seeing a thought-seed

       make something useful happen, then "it" will happen.

       transportation - those without cars, without budget for private
       transpo, who cannot take public trans to get where they need to go
       - a doctor, a food pantry, a charity used-stuff store.
       There is no safety net for this, and no money in solving it, so we
       go without, and decline, and die. It sucks, but it's just part of

       I'm assuming this isn't a rhetorical question so I'll answer.
       Simply, no one ever lost their job copying someone else, especially
       when they followed someone who was initially successful. This goes
       no matter how silly or futile the act of copycatting. Despite all
       of America's bravado about thinking outside the box and being
       innovators, almost all of us are imitators, whether it be in music,
       movies, TV shows, inventions, politics, recreation, fashion, or
       anything else. If you decide to fund something new and innovative
       and you fail, you're axed. If you can show you were following the
       crowds, you are rewarded. Why do you think consultants and polls
       are all the rage?
       People would rather bet the farm on something-so long as everyone
       else is betting the farm on it too-even if the odds are literally a
       million to one than try to pursue something new, even if the odds
       of success with that something new are better. People-and investors
       and financiers especially, disturbingly-don't know how to calculate
       risk, no matter what fancy PowerPoint presentations they may put in

            flood back in the near future. I have no idea how you take a

            Even tactics like microloans that have seen some success in

   72. MIT Alum Wantrepreneur / [264]June 2, 2013
       As one of the "want"-trepreneurs (as the author so artfully
       referred to us), this article was a wake up call for me, but
       possibly not in the way the author intended. The essay's thesis is
       that there's some GIANT posse of 20 and 30 something techies all
       just dying to make "Angry Birds 12: Lawnmower Edition" instead of
       working on the `big problems'. Well, here's two dollars of my
       thoughts on entrepreneurs and getting involved in the "big
       problems":
       Why do entrepreneurs and "want"-trepreneurs like me head to "navel
       gazing apps" to begin with? Is it really because there isn't enough
       money to start something else? Because the startup accelerators of
       America aren't asking for something else? Though sending a Call To
       Action to wealthy VCs certainly does no harm, I am hesitant to
       simply lay the blame at the feet of the tech venture capital
       industry.
       I also disagree with the essay's idea that we (meaning me and my
       20-something tech demographic) don't work on the big problems
       because we don't know about them. Harvard Square probably has more
       elderly and homeless vets holding cardboard signs out than most of
       the rest of the country. So why?
       Why do we begin "solipsistic startups" that only focus on
       ourselves?
       Well, obviously it's because we're lazy and money hungry from VCs
       and the barrier to entry for a self-serving app is low. It requires
       only me and my computer on a weekend to do it. No extra money, I
       don't even have to TALK to anyone- I can write an app, post it to a
       digital marketplace, get digital feedback, and iterate without ever
       knowing a single other person. How solipsistic of me.
       But wait... the fact that I can do that is a technical marvel in
       and of itself. And I can only do it because some other
       "solipsistic" startup techies decided they wanted to write a tool
       for other engineers back in 2002 or so. Yes, the reason I can write
       my very own "Angry Birds 12: Lawnmower Edition" is because of those
       who spent their time crafting Android or Apple's app marketplace.
       But wait... I don't have to write Angry Birds 12, says the essay
       author. I could also write apps that [265]assist social workers. Or
       a website that lets me
       [266]trade my skills for donations to a cause I believe in. But
       those might still count as exotic. What about the elderly? All of
       those apps for reminding people to take medicine, calling emergency
       help when needed, and monitoring blood pressure aren't good enough.
       What about the veterans services apps and nanny-rating apps for
       single moms? There are hundreds of them. Do they still count as
       navel-gazing?
       At this point, I suppose someone might have picked up on the
       sarcasm. The author of this essay raises many problems with
       American society that are real. Homelessness, poor single parents,
       veterans in need of medical care, and our aging population are the
       tip of the iceberg. But people ARE working on solutions, from apps
       to elderly assist robots and everything in between, a simple
       Internet search away.
       It is my belief that this author, and many responders here, have
       fallen prey to another essay-worthy topic: media bias. Just as
       there exist people who think that the only problems that matter are
       the "Big Problems", there exist people who think that the only
       existing startups are "Social Media and Gaming Apps". But as in the
       case of real big problems, real entrepreneurship solutions are

       I especially like the phrase
       "A cultural disregard for intelligence, empathy and respect; a
       cultural imperative to look hot, spend money and own the latest
       "it"-device (or should I say i-device) no matter what it costs, no
       matter how little money Mum may have."

     Meet the people who have the indignity of being over 50 and finding
     themselves suddenly jobless. These are the Untouchables of the new
     American workforce:
       A testament to the fact that America is headed towards being a
       third-world country.
       In another "third-world" country - the Philippines - those over the
       age of 30 are considered over-the-hill or
       too-experienced-too-expensive by employers.
       I can see that the US is headed back to the position that was
       abandoned at the turn of the 20th century. Specifically, 80% of the
       population was self-employed.

       Maybe you could fix that.
       Right. Back. At. YOU.
       For someone who has a degree focusing on Entrepreneurship and
       Innovation from MIT, you don't seem to know the first rule of the
       startup: You find the problem, you fix the problem, because it is
       now *your* problem.
       Now, here is some advice from someone who daily rubs elbows with
       all of those statistics you allude to in your article- the people
       you think can solve the problem will never solve the problem. They
       can't, because they will never have the kind of empathy necessary
       to understand the problem. They can't, because most of them have
       never had a welfare Christmas, they don't have friends suffering
       from missing limbs, faces, or PTSD, and they simply never have to
       choose between gas to get to work or food for the baby. They have
       never had to consider divorce as a means of securing food and
       shelter for their wife and child.
       There are people doing the things you think aren't happening. Maybe
       you don't value their efforts very much, because they don't hail
       from the kinds of schools you think churn out "the right people"
       who solve problems. Maybe they don't have the kind of solutions you
       would like to see. Have you ever considered that the 20-30
       something graduates from top tier schools have simply been educated
       to perpetuate the very problems you are railing against? Do you
       really think that a rarified pedigree somehow confers better
       problem solving skills? You would be surprised how many of those
       people are remarkably average when it comes to solving problems
       they haven't been educated to solve. And you are telling them to
       think out of the box... really?
       I'm a forty something miscegenated veteran, and son of a single
       working mother, who has been on the ground floor of launching two
       successful startups. I currently work to cut the IT overhead of
       state projects to that our tax dollars can go a little farther. I
       also work on small local projects because most of the problems you
       describe can only be solved at a local level. I do that because
       even with indiegogo, kickstarter, kiva, and other fiscal
       incubators, it is damned difficult to get funding off the ground
       for those kinds of projects. That problem is being solved, however,
       but not by MIT or Stanford. There are plenty of small tech
       incubators sprouting up all over the country, and a good part of
       their efforts are focused on solving these exact problems you bring
       up. Now, since you have expertise in finance and entrepreneurship,
       or so you claim, maybe *you* can solve the problem of getting cash
       into the hands of local developers who are working to resolve some
       of these issues.
       I mean, in ways other than vilifying your peers and denigrating
       your target audience. You know, as in having some measurable
       results, from your direct action.

       Great read and well stated. I think part of the issue is what gets
       rewarded, and some management theory over the past few decades.
       Companies and stockholders measure performance in small time
       cycles, requiring continuous improvement in things easy to measure,
       like profit. What hasn't been measured is costs to environment, to
       family and community life, to the commons. And while goals are
       important, even essential, corporate and organizational goals can
       stifle creativity and focus on minutia instead of the big picture.
       In the early 1950's the US Dept of Agriculture did a study on what
       made a healthy community. The research determined a community with
       small, family farms provided a healthy economy that had enough to
       support viable schools, markets, community and social activities
       and relationships where people are accountable to each other and
       know each other. However, agribusiness would not be able to make
       huge profits if gov't policy supported such family farms, and
       agribusiness suppressed the findings. Family farms have been
       swallowed up by agribusiness, as have mom and pop groceries, and
       lots of small entrepreneurs. Walmart and other mega-businesses are
       now bigger than any nation state and control many aspects of what
       goes for okay in our society. They need to make a bigger profit
       next quarter. That's what's measured. Not the daily grind of single
       parents not working full time, or getting benefits; not the latch
       key children who sometimes form their own `families' for safety and
       a place to belong; not the manufacturing worker's whose jobs dried
       up as they were shipped overseas; not the factory workers in
       Bangladesh that die in garment factories so we can have $5 blouses.

       I did part of my Graduate studies at a fairly prestigious tech

       the school was the attitude of the student body: some of the
       smartest and brightest minds had little to no ambition to change
       the world, or even make it a better place.
       All they wanted was a solid 9-5, to pay off their student loans,
       and essentially be upper middle class engineers/scientists with job
       security and the money to support a hobby or two.

            Most of the people from your school (the Americans) head to

       I wasn't too far into this article when the questions started. How
       is any kind of "app" going to solve a problem like "a cultural
       disregard for intelligence, empathy and respect"? Phrases like that
       make for a great screed, but they are also indefinable, and the
       last time I checked, the first step in solving any problem was to
       figure out exactly what the problem is. The author seems to show a
       singular disreagard for the intelligence of anyone working on
       anything she deems not useful. Well, a location-aware app includes
       an amazing technology that could be used in many life-saving ways,
       and probably is.
       What kind of "app" can somehow change the "inescapable lurid
       wallpaper of sex and violence that covers every surface of
       society"? This is another sonorous phrase that looks great on
       paper, but doesn't really mean much when you try to quantify it.
       And don't tell me with a straight face that no one is trying to
       steam off this wallpaper. But is the obvious solution to this
       nebulous problem, censorship, worse than the problem itself?
       In case no one has noticed, there are plenty of "apps" that could
       upend that Veterans Administration example of processing 97% of
       applications by hand, and within a couple of years need only 3% of
       the applications processed by hand. Presumably the author has never
       tried her hand at selling anything to the US government, or to any
       government for that matter. Of course, the VA also has to want to
       buy such an app before anyone can sell it to them.
       And let's move on to the problem of ex-convicts returning to
       society. This is hardly a new problem, but it is a problem that has
       been tremendously aggravated by the War on Drugs (a government
       program), not to mention the insane proliferation of state and
       federal laws that carry penalties that include prison time. The
       author claims that "there's only so much Washington can do to help
       out." Perhaps she could devote her powers of persuasion to getting
       Washington to stop doing the idiotic things it has already done
       that have done so much to get us deep into this mess.

       Most of us want to be left alone to live our lives. We do not want
       academics determining that we need this or that. What we need is
       less regulation of our everyday life ... a lot less government.
       I have a small farm. The USDA sent me a 26 page questionnaire (a
       census, they called it) that wanted to know all the minutia of my
       farm economics. And they wanted it two months before my taxes were
       due.
       They needed to know how many chickens, ducks, guinea fowl, peahens,
       rabbits, angora goats and other animals that we had.
       Now, I don't raise meat animals. I don't sell my eggs to anyone. I
       use the hay I raise to feed my own animals. This is all none of the

       because they have money. You can monetize apps for the exotic

       Where is the actual revenue stream for addressing poverty in

       I'm not being satiric here. Much, anyway. This is why it is not,
       no, not ever going to be a an entrepreneurial, investment-driven,
       or even public-private partnership solution to any of the problems
       the unexotic underclass faces. Meitar Moscovitz wasn't wrong the
       other day; capitalism doesn't DO that.
       We used to have a couple of tools for solving problems like that.
       As Tony Benn repeatedly pointed out, one was called "democracy." As
       Frances Fox Piven demonstrated historically, another one used to be
       called "collective action." But Thatcher and Reagan (and a bunch of
       wealthy-funded think tanks) managed to make both of those into
       dirty words. And there's no money, and nothing in our built
       environment that we can use, to rehabilitate either of those words.
       So we're basically screwed -- until and unless the revolution
       comes, unless and until it gets so bad that people stop believing
       that democracy and collective action are bad things or, that, if if
       they are bad things, they're less worse things than kleptocratic
       plutocracy.

       Maybe I misunderstand why talented young people are enamored with
       start-ups. I thought it was the same reason they liked Wall Street,
       hedge funds, law school, mgmt consulting, etc., over the last 20
       years - because they saw it as the fastest route to status and
       money. Most people who choose elite colleges are from that world,
       and even the ones who aren't are sucked into that vortex. Start-ups
       are just the latest "hot sector" where you can get rich quick and
       impress your parents' friends.
       If that's the case, there's no big money solving the problems of
       the mis-fortunate. I guess government could change that, but they
       could just change their own policies and spend money directly on
       those problems, without worrying about start-ups and for-profit
       companies.
       If young people instead want to "make a difference," then this is a
       good way to think about it. But I haven't seen much evidence of
       that over the last 30 years since I graduated - instead the
       opposite, where more and more younger people are focused more and
       more on career, money, and status. I am sure the pendulum will
       eventually swing back, but it hasn't yet.
