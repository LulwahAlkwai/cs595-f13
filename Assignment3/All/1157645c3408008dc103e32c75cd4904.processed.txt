SmartThings opens shop for Internet of Things

   The Internet of Things is open for business, and [5]SmartThings wants
   to be the hub that connects developers and device makers with
   consumers. The startup launched the SmartThings Shop, a marketplace for
   hardware and apps that do everything from unlocking doors and turning
   lights on or off to keeping valuables safe and triggering a siren sound
   when a dog jumps on the couch configured with an embedded sensor.

   SmartThings is building what CEO Alex Hawkinson calls a "physical
   graph," an analog to the social graph for the Internet of Things.
   Hawkinson's notion of a physical graph comes to life in SmartThings'
   cloud, which is the hub that connects and adds intelligence to
   potentially billions of connected objects.

   Unlike Nest (thermostats), Dropcam (Wi-Fi cameras) or Fitbit (health
   and fitness tracker), SmartThings is an open-source platform that
   primarily depends on a developer community to build momentum and a real
   business. The startup has more than 3,000 developers supporting its
   platform so far, the company said.

   SmartThings' Selling Proposition

   SmartThings is selling its hardware at close to cost, Hawkinson said,
   but plans to make money by taking a slice of revenues from its app
   developer community. In addition, the company is looking to take a fee
   cut from service providers associated with the SmartThings network. For
   example, if a SmartThings sensor detects a home security problem, the
   app could immediately dispatch a local security service. If moisture
   sensors detect a problem, SmartThings could guarantee that a plumber
   will show up within a certain period of time.

   Appliances are also becoming part of the Internet of Things. It may not
   be practical to load up a toaster with sensors that can tweet out when
   your bagel is done, but it would be useful for washers, dryers, ovens
   and other hefty appliances to offer status updates as well as safety
   alerts.

   Dryers and washing machines were involved in one out of every 22 home
   structure fires reported to U.S. fire departments between 2006 and
   2010, according to the [6]National Fire Protection Association. Clothes
   dryers were the main cause of 92 percent of those fires, totaling more
   than 15,000 in 2010.

   "Appliances have a slow-moving replacement cycle," Hawkinson said. "We
   are talking to big names about the roadmap, and we don't have to do
   anything special because of the standards. It would take $20 to
   retrofit existing appliances to know the temperature of a dryer."

   If successful, SmartThings will collect and aggregate a lot of useful,
   anonymized data in its cloud. Insurance companies, for example, could
   analyze SmartThings usage patterns that could be applied to their risk
   assessment and pricing algorithms.

   Internet of Things Ready for Take-off

   SmartThings, which has 44 employees, raised $1.2 million in a
   [7]Kickstarter campaign to build a community and get feedback about the
   product, and more than $4 million from founder and angel investors.

   Hawkinson thinks the timing it right for the Internet of Things to take
   off.

   "As the smartphone becomes the center of communication, media and
   banking, it's ready to be useful in rest of your life" said Hawkinson.
   In addition to smartphones and apps as remote control devices, he said
   that the Internet of Things is being driven by the availability of
   low-power, high-range mesh networks (such as Bluetooth Zigbee and
   Z-wave); cloud computing; cheaper hardware enabled by 3D printing and
   lower cost chips and sensors; and the cost dropping to less than $5 to
   connect things.

   "With the democratization of hardware, with robotics and 3D printing,
   you don't need a factory," Hawkinson said. "You need some electronic
   engineering expertise and a few thousand dollars."

   SmartThings is not alone in building a business around the emerging
   Internet of Things. Giants such as Comcast are making a major push with
   subscription-based home security and automation services, and startups
   such as Revolv and Ninja Blocks are developing no-contract, open
   platforms.

   SmartThings Shop

   With the SmartThings Shop, for mobile web and desktop, Hawkinson is
   following the model of Apple's App Store, curating the content and
   crafting a review process for third-party products and services.

   SmartThings Shop is currently offering two starter kits for home
   control applications, for $199 and $299. The kits include the
   SmartThings hub and various sensors and devices for receiving
   notifications when people, pets, and cars arrive and leave, turning on
   lights or a TV in response to motion detection and other home control
   scenarios. The shop also has individual items, including
   SmartThings-compatible devices from GE, Schlage and Kwikset, and
   solution sets for various categories, such as keeping track of kids and
   elders, turning off appliances via a phone and controlling and
   automating lighting.

   Securing the Internet of Things

   In connecting more things to the Internet, cyber-criminals have
   exponentially more points of access to invade sensor-based devices and
   apps. "At the DNA level we are super-mindful of privacy and security,"
   Hawkinson said. He isn't recommending that defibrillators be integrated
   with SmartThings, but "SmartApps" can only access devices that are
   explicitly configured by users.

   "Each device across the entire network has a globally unique ID at the
   hardware level that cannot be spoofed, and hardware level encryption
   with new keys regularly established between the SmartThings Hub and the
   SmartThings Cloud," he said.

   The reality is that a burglar is more apt to break a window to gain
   access to a home than hack an encrypted lock. "In all cases, it would
   be much better for the homeowner to have connectivity and awareness of
   events taking place versus not," Hawkinson said. That sounds like the
   beginnings of a good business plan.
