   When people think about the original founders of Apple, most people
   usually think of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. These guys are two of
   the most notable figures in tech history. However, Apple has a third
   co-founder that is rarely ever mentioned. In fact, the latest Jobs
   movie starring Ashton Kutcher didn't even include him as a character.

   Meet Ronald Wayne, some media outlets in the past has dubbed him as
   "the unluckiest man in the world", because he sold his 10% stake in
   Apple 12 days after co-founding the company -- his stake would be worth
   around $35 billion today. Aside from that, in the early 1990's he saw
   that Apple was plummeting and decided to sell the original document of
   the first Apple company agreement for $500. After nearly two decades,
   that same exact document was sold at an auction for $1.8 million
   dollars. Now if you think thats not bad enough, at one point in his
   life, he had all his life savings stolen from him as well. He likes to
   summarize his entrepreneurial enterprises as always being "either a day
   late, and/or a dollar short".

   Ron has made some key contributions to Apple's beginnings. For one, he
   drew the first Apple logo, wrote the original company partnership
   agreement and the Apple I manual. He was also chosen personally by
   Steve Jobs to be a founding partner because he liked Ron's ability to
   solve disagreements. The 10% given to him was for him to act as a
   tie-breaker if there was ever a disagreement between Steve Jobs and
   Steve Wozniak.

   The Original Apple Partnership Agreement

   We recently had the pleasure of being invited by Ron to his house for
   an interview in Pahrump, Nevada -- a little town about 1 hour away from
   Las Vegas. When we arrived, we saw that Wayne lives in a relatively
   modest lifestyle and spends most of his time as a coins and stamps
   dealer to supplement his Social Security checks. The NextShark team was
   inspired and humbled to see the level of positivity and generosity this
   man has after going through so much in his life-time. In this
   interview, Wayne reflects on his life at Atari, forming Apple and
   working with Steve Jobs.

   Interview Highlights:

On if he gets annoyed doing so many interviews about Apple

     No. Look, I live my life step by step, event by event as it happens.
     And by the way I got myself extremely fortunate to have been at a
     turning point in history and the establishment of Apple was indeed a
     turning point in history. Although at that time of course, nobody
     really knows this. It takes perspective of history to do that.

On his regret of selling the original Apple company agreement for $500

     Oh the contract. That's the one thing in this whole experience I
     really do regret. I sold that contract for $500 -- that was 20 years
     ago. It was the same contract that sold at auction about 18 months
     ago for 1.3 million. That, I regret.

Losing his life savings

     I lost my life savings in the Florida house. That was what obliged
     me to sell [my] house in Florida. It was an inside job. We figured
     that, and the person who stole it was caught, spent six years in
     prison, which didn't mean of course a lot of good. But there was 145
     ounces of gold, $3000 on face-value silver coin, and how much
     collector's coin, no one will ever know.

MellyLee-RonWayne001

On whether he ever asks himself "WHY ME!?"

     No. As a matter of fact, it kind of confused people at that time.
     The fellow not only broke in to my safe by finding the combination
     and going in -- because the safe is five feet high, four feet wide,
     three feet deep, weighs 2 1/2 tons, the walls are four inches thick
     concrete steel; he needed the combination to get in there. What he
     did was he turned it over to some pro because he had been shoving
     some stuff up his nose and apparently he threatened him concrete
     shoes if he didn't come up with the money, so he decided to pay him
     off with my money. So he told them when I was going to be out of the
     house, and they came in and emptied the safe, and then they smashed
     the lock. it took me two days to get the lock open -- to get the
     safe open -- and I was waiting, wondering, hoping. Well they opened
     the safe and of course, it was empty. And everybody was wondering
     why, at that point in time, I did not go screaming up the walls? My
     answer to them was very simple and I meant it. I said, "What am I
     supposed to do, make myself sick over the sides?" I mean the
     situation has happened. I'll deal with it. When something happens,
     you just deal with it.

Why he co-founded Apple, then left 12 days later selling his shares for $800

     There were many reasons why I took myself out of it 12 days later.
     One of the reasons, it was a straightforward business decision in
     the sense that I have had my own corporation I told you years
     before, and that was when I learned that I was a hell of a lot
     better engineer than I was a business man. The whole thing went
     belly up and rather than use the corporate shell to protect myself
     against creditors and so on -- which is what you normally do; that's
     what you build a corporate shell for -- I felt that it was my
     enterprise. It had failed because of my inability to do the job
     right. I blew it. Why should everybody else pay for it because I
     blew it? So all the creditors over the span of about a year were
     paid off a hundred cents on a dollar, and all the stock that I had
     sold in that corporation were bought back for the price they paid
     for. I felt very good; I could look in the mirror when I am shaving
     and not be embarrassed. But at the same time, it was a very
     traumatic experience.

     With that reality in mind, all of the sudden I am in this company
     arrangements -- it's not a corporation, it's a company -- and who is
     reachable? I mean Jobs and Woz didn't have two nickels to rub
     together. I had a house, I had a car, I had a checking account -- I
     was reachable. Well when that contract was drawn out, Jobs went out
     and did exactly what he was supposed to do. He got a contract with a
     place called The Byte Shop to sell them a certain number of
     computers. And then he went out, also did exactly what he was
     supposed to do and he borrowed $15,000 for the materials necessary
     to fill the order. Perfectly appropriate. The only problem was, as I
     heard, The Byte Shop had a terrible reputation for not paying their
     bills. If this thing blew up, how's that $15,000 going to get
     repaid? Do they have the money? No. Was I reachable? Yes.

     Among other things, when Jobs and I worked at Atari... I went to
     work for Atari, the company was three and a half years old, and
     Atari was organized under the genius of a man by the name of Nolan
     Bushnell. Well Nolan, being the genius that he was, pursued exactly
     the same course that geniuses do when going to business like this:
     get the product out on the street. What it takes to set up a company
     is a nuisance. You want to set up a drawing number system? Fine,
     your first drawing is drawing number one; next drawing is drawing
     number two. It doesn't work that way. Not when you have been in
     engineering and design and drafting for a number of decades that I
     had. You have to have a meaningful numbering system so that the
     documents that you put into the files were traceable; you can pick
     up one document and follow the thread of numbers to rebuild the
     entire paper structure for that particular product. And you do this
     through the structuring of your numbering system. And I had to
     rebuild the numbering system.

     Jobs knew about these documentation systems that I had put together
     for Atari and he was very impressed with them. And I had every
     reason to believe that Jobs wanted me in Apple to set up and run the
     documentation systems in the entire documentation department. There
     was a bit of a problem there because I was a product development
     engineer on my own right. Even though I knew, at the time, that I
     was standing in the shadow of giants. I knew these guys knew a hell
     lot more about product development than I did. I felt I was never
     going to get a project of my own; they would certainly not get
     involved in slot machines, which was my passion; and the last thing
     I wanted to do was to spend the next 20 years of my life in a large
     backroom office, shuffling papers.

     These were some of the reasons, aside from the fact that I was in
     40s and these kids were in their 20s. And they were whirlwinds. It
     was like having a tiger by the tail. And I said this many times
     before and I meant it, if I have stayed with Apple I probably would
     have wound up the richest man in the cemetery.
