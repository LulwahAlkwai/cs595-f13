After crunching Reinhart and Rogoff's data, we've concluded that high debt
does not slow growth

   May 29, 2013
   Debt as percentage of GDP

   Leaving aside monetary policy, the textbook Keynesian remedy for
   recession is to increase government spending or cut taxes. The obvious
   problem with that is that higher government spending and lower taxes
   tend to put the government deeper in debt. So the [101]announcement on
   April 15, 2013 by University of Massachusetts at Amherst economists
   Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin that Carmen Reinhart and
   Ken Rogoff had made a mistake in their analysis claiming that debt
   leads to lower economic growth has been big news. Remarkably for a
   story so wonkish, the tale of Reinhart and Rogoff's errors even
   [102]made it onto the Colbert Report. Six weeks later, discussions of
   Herndon, Ash and Pollin's challenge to Reinhart and Rogoff continue in
   earnest [103]in the economics blogosphere, in the [104]Wall Street
   Journal, and in the [105]New York Times.

   In defending the main conclusions of their work, while conceding some
   errors, [106]Reinhart and Rogoff point out that even after the errors
   are corrected, there is a substantial negative correlation between debt
   levels and economic growth. That is a fair description of what Herndon,
   Ash and Pollin find, as discussed in an earlier Quartz column, "[107]An
   Economist's Mea Culpa: I relied on Reinhardt and Rogoff." But, as
   mentioned there, and as Reinhart and Rogoff point out in [108]their
   response to Herndon, Ash and Pollin, there is a key remaining issue of
   what causes what. It is well known among economists that low growth
   leads to extra debt because tax revenues go down and spending goes up
   in a recession. But does debt also cause low growth in a vicious cycle?
   That is the question.

   We wanted to see for ourselves what Reinhart and Rogoff's data could
   say about whether high national debt seems to cause low growth. In
   particular, we wanted to separate the effect of low growth in causing
   higher debt from any effect of higher debt in causing low growth. There
   is no way to do this perfectly. But we wanted to make the attempt. We
   had one key difference in our approach from many of the other analyses
   of Reinhart and Rogoff's data: we decided to focus only on long-run
   effects. This is a way to avoid getting confused by the effects of
   business cycles such as the Great Recession that we are still
   recovering from. But one limitation of focusing on long-run effects is
   that it might leave out one of the more obvious problems with debt: the
   bond markets might at any time refuse to continue lending except at
   punitively high interest rates, causing debt crises like that have been
   faced by Greece, Ireland, and Cyprus, and to a lesser degree Spain and
   Italy. So far, debt crises like this have been rare for countries that
   have borrowed in their own currency, but are a serious danger for
   countries that borrow in a foreign currency or share a currency with
   many other countries in the euro zone.

   Here is what we did to focus on long-run effects: to avoid being
   confused by business-cycle effects, we looked at the relationship
   between national debt and growth in the period of time from five to 10
   years later. In their paper "[109]Debt Overhangs, Past and Present,"
   Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, along with Vincent Reinhart, emphasize
   that most episodes of high national debt last a long time. That means
   that if high debt really causes low growth in a slow, corrosive way, we
   should be able to see high debt now associated with low growth far into
   the future for the simple reason that high debt now tends to be
   associated with high debt for quite some time into the future.

   Here is the bottom line. Based on economic theory, it would be
   surprising indeed if high levels of national debt didn't have at least
   some slow, corrosive negative effect on economic growth. And we still
   worry about the effects of debt. But the two of us could not find even
   a shred of evidence in the Reinhart and Rogoff data for a negative
   effect of government debt on growth.

   The graphs at the top show show our first take at analyzing the
   Reinhardt and Rogoff data. This first take seemed to indicate a large
   effect of low economic growth in the past in raising debt combined with
   a smaller, but still very important effect of high debt in lowering
   later economic growth. On the right panel of the graph above, you can
   see the strong downward slope that indicates a strong correlation
   between low growth rates in the period from ten years ago to five years
   ago with more debt, suggesting that low growth in the past causes high
   debt. On the left panel of the graph above, you can see the mild
   downward slope that indicates a weaker correlation between debt and
   lower growth in the period from five years later to ten years later,
   suggesting that debt might have some negative effect on growth in the
   long run. In order to avoid overstating the amount of data available,
   these graphs have only one dot for each five-year period in the data
   set. If our further analysis had confirmed these results, we were
   prepared to argue that the evidence suggested a serious worry about the
   effects of debt on growth. But the story the graphs above seem to tell
   dissolves on closer examination.

   Given the strong effect past low growth seemed to have on debt, we felt
   that we needed to take into account the effect of past economic growth
   rates on debt more carefully when trying to tease out the effects in
   the other direction, of debt on later growth. Economists often use a
   technique called [110]multiple regression analysis (or "[111]ordinary
   least squares") to take into account the effect of one thing when
   looking at the effect of something else. Here we are doing something
   that is quite close both in spirit and the numbers it generates for our
   analysis, but allows us to use graphs to show what is going on a little
   better.

   The effects of low economic growth in the past may not all come from
   business cycle effects. It is possible that there are political effects
   as well, in which a slowly growing pie to be divided makes it harder
   for different political factions to agree, resulting in deficits. Low
   growth in the past may also be a sign that a government is incompetent
   or dysfunctional in some other way that also causes high debt. So the
   way we took into account the effects of economic growth in the past on
   debt--and the effects on debt of the level of government competence
   that past growth may signify--was to look at what level of debt could
   be predicted by knowing the rates of economic growth from the past
   year, and in the three-year periods from 10 to 7 years ago, 7 to 4
   years ago and 4 to 1 years ago. The graph below, labeled "Prediction of
   Debt Based on Past Growth" shows that knowing these various economic
   growth rates over the past 10 years helps a lot in predicting how high
   the ratio of national debt to GDP will be on a year by year basis.
   (Doing things on a year by year basis gives the best prediction, but
   means the graph has five times as many dots as the other scatter
   plots.) The "Prediction of Debt Based on Past Growth" graph shows that
   some countries, at some times, have debt above what one would expect
   based on past growth and some countries have debt below what one would
   expect based on past growth. If higher debt causes lower growth, then
   national debt beyond what could be predicted by past economic growth
   should be bad for future growth.
   Prediction of debt based on past growth
   Our next graph below, labeled "Relationship Between Future Growth and
   Excess Debt to GDP" shows the relationship between a debt to GDP ratio
   beyond what would be predicted by past growth and economic growth 5 to
   10 years later. Here there is no downward slope at all. In fact there
   is a small upward slope. This was surprising enough that we asked
   others we knew to see what they found when trying our basic approach.
   They bear no responsibility for our interpretation of the analysis
   here, but Owen Zidar, an economics graduate student at the University
   of California, Berkeley, and Daniel Weagley, graduate student in
   finance at the University of Michigan were generous enough to analyze
   the data from our angle to help alert us if they found we were
   dramatically off course and to suggest various ways to handle details.
   (In addition, Yu She, a student in the master's of applied economics
   program at the University of Michigan proofread our computer code.)  We
   have no doubt that someone could use a slightly different data set or
   tweak the analysis enough to make the small upward slope into a small
   downward slope. But the fact that we got a small upward slope so easily
   (on our first try with this approach of controlling for past growth
   more carefully) means that there is no robust evidence in the Reinhart
   and Rogoff data set for a negative long-run effect of debt on future
   growth once the effects of past growth on debt are taken into account.
   (We still get an upward slope when we do things on a year-by-year basis
   instead of looking at non-overlapping five-year growth periods.)
   Relationship between future growth and excess debt to gdp

   Daniel Weagley raised a very interesting issue that the very slight
   upward slope shown for the "Relationship Between Future Growth and
   Excess Debt to GDP" is composed of two different kinds of evidence.
   Times when countries in the data set, on average, have higher debt than
   would be predicted tend to be associated with higher growth in the
   period from five to 10 years later. But at any time, countries that
   have debt that is unexpectedly high not only compared to their own past
   growth, but also compared to the unexpected debt of other countries at
   that time, do indeed tend to have lower growth five to 10 years later.
   It is only speculating, but this is what one might expect if the main
   mechanism for long-run effects of debt on growth is more of the
   short-run effect we mentioned above: the danger that the "[112]bond
   market vigilantes" will start demanding high interest rates. It is hard
   for the bond market vigilantes to take their money out of all
   government bonds everywhere in the world, so having debt that looks
   high compared to other countries at any given time might be what
   matters most. Five year averages across all countries
   Our view is that evidence from trends in the average level of debt
   around the world over time are just as instructive as evidence from the
   cross-national evidence from debt in one country being higher than in
   other countries at a given time. Our last graph (just above) shows what
   the evidence from trends in average levels over time looks like. High
   debt levels in the late 1940s and the 1950s were followed five to 10
   years later with relatively high growth.  Low debt levels in the 1960s
   and 1970s were followed five to 10 years later by relatively low
   growth. High debt levels in the 1980s and 1990s were followed five to
   10 years later by relatively high growth. If anyone can come up with a
   good argument for why this evidence from trends in the average levels
   over time should be dismissed, then only the cross-national evidence
   about debt in one country compared to another would remain, which by
   itself makes debt look bad for growth. But we argue that there is not
   enough justification to say that special occurrences each year make the
   evidence from trends in the average levels over time worthless.
   (Technically, we don't think it is appropriate to use "year fixed
   effects" to soak up and throw away evidence from those trends over time
   in the average level of debt around the world.)

   We don't want anyone to take away the message that high levels of
   national debt are a matter of no concern. As discussed in "[113]Why
   Austerity Budgets Won't Save Your Economy," the big problem with debt
   is that the only ways to avoid paying it back or paying interest on it
   forever are national bankruptcy or hyper-inflation. And unless the
   borrowed money is spent in ways that foster economic growth in a big
   way, paying it back or paying interest on it forever will mean future
   pain in the form of higher taxes or lower spending.

   There is very little evidence that spending borrowed money on
   conventional Keynesian stimulus--spent in the ways dictated by what has
   become normal politics in the US, Europe and Japan--(or [114]the kinds
   of tax cuts typically proposed) can stimulate the economy enough to
   avoid having to raise taxes or cut spending in the future to pay the
   debt back. There are three main ways to use debt to increase growth
   enough to avoid having to raise taxes or cut spending later:

     1. Spending on national investments that have a very high return,
     such as in scientific research, fixing roads or bridges that have
     been sorely neglected.
     2. Using government support to catalyze private borrowing by firms
     and households, such as government support for student loans, and
     temporary investment tax credits or [115]Federal Lines of Credit to
     households used as a stimulus measure.
     3. Issuing debt to create a sovereign wealth fund--that is, putting
     the money into the corporate stock and bond markets instead of
     spending it, as discussed in "[116]Why the US needs its own
     sovereign wealth fund." For anyone who thinks government debt is
     important as a form of collateral for private firms (see "[117]How a
     US Sovereign Wealth Fund Can Alleviate a Scarcity of Safe Assets"),
     this is the way to get those benefits of debt, while earning more
     interest and dividends for tax payers than the extra debt costs. And
     a sovereign wealth fund (like [118]breaking through the zero lower
     bound with electronic money) makes the tilt of governments toward
     short-term financing caused by [119]current quantitative easing
     policies unnecessary.

   But even if debt is used in ways that do require higher taxes or lower
   spending in the future, it may sometimes be worth it. If a country has
   its own currency, and borrows using appropriate long-term debt (so it
   only has to refinance a small fraction of the debt each year) the
   danger from bond market vigilantes can be kept to a minimum. And other
   than the danger from bond market vigilantes, we find no persuasive
   evidence from Reinhart and Rogoff's data set to worry about anything
   but the higher future taxes or lower future spending needed to pay for
   that long-term debt. We look forward to further evidence and further
   thinking on the effects of debt. But our bottom line from this
   analysis, and the thinking we have been able to articulate above, is
   this: Done carefully, debt is not damning. Debt is just debt.
