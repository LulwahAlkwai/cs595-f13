Still nothing from CMS, but Blue Shield of CA acts

   One of the mysteries of the medical arms race is why the CMS
   administrators who have served in the Obama Administration (Don Berwick
   and Marilyn Taverner) never took action to eliminate the unjustified
   [7]Medicare subsidy of high cost proton beam machines.
   So, bravo to Blue Shield of California for doing just that, even in the
   face of inaction at the federal level.  [8]Here's the story from the
   Los Angeles Times.  Excerpts:
   As hospitals race to offer the latest in high-tech care, a major
   California health insurer is pushing back and refusing to pay for some
   of the more expensive and controversial [9]cancer treatments.
   Blue Shield of California is taking on this high-cost radiation
   treatment just as Scripps Health in San Diego prepares to open a
   gleaming, $230-million proton beam therapy center this fall, only the
   second one in California and the 12th nationwide.
   This week, Blue Shield began notifying doctors statewide of its new
   policy for early-stage prostate cancer patients, effective in October.
   The San Francisco insurer says there's no scientific evidence to
   justify spending $30,000 more for proton beam treatment compared with
   the price it pays for other forms of radiation that deliver similar
   results.
   "Proton beam is really the perfect example of all that is wrong with
   our healthcare system," said Cary Gross, a researcher at the Yale
   School of Medicine who recently compared outcomes for 30,000 Medicare
   patients who received proton beam or standard radiation. "The rush to
   adopt proton beam is far outpacing the amount of evidence to support
   its use."
   In December, Gross and other Yale researchers published a study that
   analyzed 30,000 Medicare patients who received proton beam therapy or
   standard radiation for prostate cancer. Supporters of proton therapy
   say it helps those patients avoid common side effects from radiation
   such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction.
   But the Yale researchers found that there was no difference in terms of
   side effects a year after treatment. Yet Medicare paid more than
   $32,000 for a course of proton beam treatment, compared with less than
   $19,000 for conventional radiation.

          I know that you think this payment decision is well within CMS'
          purview, but I have read elsewhere vague statements that imply
          that it is not.
          I wish, once and for all, someone would explain this in plain
          English. Can CMS just decide what they will pay by fiat, or
          not????? And if not, why not??

          The question remains in either case. If it is within CMS
          jurisdiction, why no action? If it is without, why no advocacy
          from the leaders for the change?
          But I'd like to hear the answers to your questions, too.

          I applaud Blue Shield of CA's action as well. As an alternative,
          though, for patients and their doctors who are convinced that
          proton beam therapy is better than IMRT, Blue Shield of CA could
          offer to pay the IMRT reimbursement rate of $19,000 and let the
          patient and family cover the difference if they can. I know that
          many if not most of the elderly wouldn't be able to afford to
          but there is probably a significant number who can. The insurer
          could offer patients that choice through reference pricing, at
          least as long as CMS continues to pay for the procedure.
          As for why CMS doesn't just refuse to cover proton beam therapy,
          I think the answer is that the ability of special interests and
          their money to influence congressmen and senators too often
          trumps rational decision making by CMS.

          Barry, I too suspect that politics plays a role, although I
          wasn't saying CMS should refuse to cover it, just that it should
          not be given a premium based on the manufacturer's hype rather
          than data.
          On another of your excellent and oft-made points, Barry, I read
          that North Carolina recently passed legislation requiring its
          hospitals to publicly disclose the prices they negotiate with
          insurers. It's a start, although I suspect gaming will occur.
          Paul, I think your comment raises a larger question - what is,
          after all, the mandate of CMS? Is it supposed to advocate for
          cost containment or just follow the advice of the RUC, as it
          seems to have been doing? Its leaders seem to believe the
          latter.

          Since CMS isnt allowed (by Congressional mandate) to consider
          cost-effectiveness in deciding upon coverage, what would their
          basis for rejecting a therapy preferred by provider and patient
          in the absence of any evidence proving that it leads to worse
          outcomes? Agree with you completely on the waste, but is this in
          CMS' purview, or isn't this the kind of move that the death
          panel talk succeeded in preventing CMS from making?

          akhan13, I too would like a clear statement on the

          While I commend BCBS for taking action to reduce healthcare
          spending I can't help but think this was for their own good and
          not the greater good. BCBS is focused on their bottom line and
          nothing more, so let's not give them more credit than they
          deserve.
          BCBS limits coverage for metabolic formula and medical foods to
          $5000/year for children and adults greater than 6 years of age
          with phenylketonuria (PKU), despite strong evidence that people
          with PKU must consume the medical formula and be on a low
          protein "diet for life." I believe in the instance you mentioned
          they acted on literature that was not as strong as the PKU
          literature. My assumption is because providing essential medical
          formula for patients to be normal, high functioning adults
          decreases their bottom line instead of increasing it.

          It is my understanding that CMS cannot consider cost in deciding
          WHETHER to cover something. What is not clear to me is how they
          decide on the $$ number that they will pay, and whether/how they
          can change that number as more evidence comes in. As Barry says,
          why not cover it at the same price as IMRT? Who decides if it
          deserves more?

   [35]Neville Sarkari MD, FACP said...
          CMS doesn't just decide on a price. There is a something called
          the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), sort of
          similar to the DRG system for inpatient.
          All the possible outpatient procedures that are paid under this
          system are divided into payment classification groups (APC's).
          Similar procedures (similar in clinical type, cost, etc) are
          bundled into the same APC.
          Different APC's are weighted as to their cost and payment levels
          are assigned based on those weightings.
          There is a technical advisory panel that meets twice a year to
          give CMS input about the APC groupings. I was on that panel for
          about a year, but had to leave it due to a change in my job.
          At those meetings, industry groups come in and lobby CMS about
          why their technology, device, or procedure should go into a
          higher weighted group (more payment).
          Here's the kicker though. The total amount available for the
          OPPS is a fixed pie each year. So if one APC group gets a higher
          payment, it has to come out of somewhere else in the OPPS.
          Hospitals turn in cost data and CMS uses those self-reported
          costs in adjusting or assigning the payment rates (amongst many
          other factors).

          Are the rates now the same as IMRT for prostate cancer?

          Historically, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC)
          offered suggestions for how the Medicare program could save
          money. While it did much good work, most of its recommendations
          gathered dust because they required congressional approval to
          take effect which was rarely if ever forthcoming.
          Under the Affordable Care Act, the Independent Payment Advisory
          Board (IPAB) is supposed to fill this role. However, the
          legislation doesn't allow the IPAB to offer any ideas that would
          ration care, reduce benefits or increase beneficiary premiums,
          deductibles or co-payments. That leaves mainly tinkering with
          provider payments, especially for services, tests and procedures
          that are deemed to be overused and offer only marginal medical
          benefits at best.
          At the same time, CMS is not allowed to take costs into account
          in deciding what to pay for and not pay for. So, anything that
          wins FDA approval because it's better than a placebo gets
          covered even if they're no more effective than older therapies
          that cost much less. We can thank the power of special interests
          and their money for this. To hear single payer advocates argue
          that we would all be much better off if we extended Medicare to
          the entire population leaves me incredulous.

          Read the book "Confidence Men". It explains how the ACA evolved
          from health CARE reform to health INSURANCE reform, with the
          only feature being more coverage. Nobody in government is
          pursuing outcome-based health care even as the costs of the
          present mess are clearly unsustainable.

          Paul,
          I doubt it has come down that far, but I do not know for sure.
          Keep in mind that IMRT itself is no better than the even cheaper
          "Conformal" therapy for prostate cancer.
          See here:
          http://www.healthnewsreview.org/2013/05/imrt/
          Supposedly the reduced rates are in part due to a mistake one
          center made in their cost reports, so the rate might go up
          again...

          I'm glad I received my proton therapy before Blue Shield of Ca.
          Made this decision. I am also glad that I am up for open
          enrollment in a few weeks, time to change!
          All you need to do is attend a local prostate cancer support
          group. You will find men who have either had their prostate
          removed, IMRT or some procedure other than Proton Beam Therapy.
          The PBR patients are out living life as normal, no need for a
          support group. Side effects during and after radiation are
          minimal, if any at all.
          I do believe these decisions are supported by special interest
          groups. Let's think, who has more money to push their agenda?
          The many thousands of IMRT centers and the many thousands of
          surgeons that will lose patients to PBT centers as more are
          built.
          If you think that new technology and better procedures are
          what's wrong with our health care system, you are what is wrong.
          Don't trust all the studies, go to a support group and listen to
          the men that didn't have the knowledge or access to Proton Beam
          Therapy. Then find men that have had PBT, different stories.
          My grandfather died from prostate cancer. My father and uncle
          are living with the side effects. They are continually costing
          their insurance carriers more money with follow up procedures
          and medications.
          I am living life like it never happened.

          As "Lisa" commented on the article link above, 40-60% IMRT
          patients have complications compared to 2% of Proton Beam
          patients.
          They both kill the cancer. One like a shotgun blast, the other
          with precise accuracy.

          Sorry, anecdotes do not amount to science. It is not uncommon
          for people who have had successful treatment to feel loyalty to
          the modality chosen. That's not the way clinical choices should
          be made for society.

          Sorry, it is not anecdotes, it is science at its best.
          Please read about the differences of IMRT and Proton Beam
          Therapy. Try and use your "scientific mind". Scientific fact,
          PBT patients receive much less radiation to non-cancerous tissue
          than IMRT patients. Hence less side effects with PBT.
          Negative comments to someone's experiences are not appreciated.
          Also, why would you assume that a person who has gone through a
          fight with cancer, didn't spend many hours researching the best
          treatment possible?
          Just hoping that someday our decision makers will have a little
          common sence and actually do what is best for the people and not
          their bank accounts.

          My comment was not negative about your experience. I was just
          suggesting that such experience is not the basis for how society
          should choose to spend scarce dollars among the various types of
          medical treatments available. To date, there is not scientific
          evidence that suggests that proton beam machine produce
          appreciably better results for prostate treatment. If we choose
          to spend billions of dollars on this, there are likely other
          priority areas that will not be funded.
