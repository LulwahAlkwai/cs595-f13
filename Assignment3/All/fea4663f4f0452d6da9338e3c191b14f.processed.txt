Berkeley Researcher Who Questioned Herbicide's Safety Loses Lab Financing

   By Paul Basken

   The University of California at Berkeley cut laboratory financing this
   week for a professor who has complained for years about
   [17]corporate-led retaliation for his association of health risks with
   a widely used herbicide.

   "We're dead in the water," Tyrone B. Hayes, a professor of integrative
   biology, said Tuesday after being told by his department chairman that
   the account containing his laboratory funds--needed to pay for basic
   functional operations, such as the care of test animals--had been
   frozen.

   The chairman, John P. Huelsenbeck, confirmed that Mr. Hayes has had his
   research activities "paused," though he said he couldn't provide
   details, and a university spokesman said he was unaware of any formal
   punitive action.

   The episode marks the latest chapter in a long-running saga dating back
   to 1999, when Mr. Hayes, working on a contract for Syngenta, found the
   company's herbicide atrazine might be inhibiting the sexual development
   of male frogs.

   An [18]article published in June by Environmental Health News cited
   company documents as showing that Syngenta spent several years and
   millions of dollars on a campaign to discredit Mr. Hayes and other
   scientists involved in the matter. The article says the company's
   efforts included contacting Duke University, which shortly afterward
   withdrew a job offer to Mr. Hayes. (Environmental Health News is a
   nonprofit news organization founded by John Peterson Myers, an adjunct
   professor of chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University.)

   Mr. Hayes said he believes some Berkeley officials, including Graham R.
   Fleming, vice chancellor for research, may have joined in efforts to
   penalize him out of a desire to protect a $25-million, five-year
   research agreement between Berkeley and Novartis, a parent company of
   Syngenta.

   Mr. Huelsenbeck referred questions about this week's action against Mr.
   Hayes to Mr. Fleming. Mr. Fleming declined a request to comment,
   referring questions to a university spokesman, Dan Mogulof, who denied
   any action by Berkeley to interfere with Mr. Hayes or his work.

   "Nobody has taken any action against his lab," Mr. Mogulof said.

Dispute Over Fees and Frogs

   The situation is complicated by the fact that, along with his
   controversies involving Syngenta and atrazine, Mr. Hayes has been a
   longstanding critic of Berkeley's fees for laboratory care. He said the
   university acted to force the effective closure of his lab just hours
   after he sent a letter on Monday to Mr. Fleming detailing his
   contention that he, in particular, is charged far too much for the care
   of his laboratory frogs.

   Mr. Hayes said in the letter that his daily fee is more than 21 times
   larger than that paid by a Berkeley colleague, Richard M. Harland, a
   professor of genetics and development, who uses the same type of frog.

   But Roger A. Van Andel, director of Berkeley's Office of Laboratory
   Animal Care, which provides the care and sets the fees, faulted the
   analysis and denied any discrimination against Mr. Hayes.

   The fees are based on a variety of factors, including the size of the
   tank needed for the type of frog, Mr. Van Andel said. Mr. Harland does
   use some of the species, Xenopus laevis, used by Mr. Hayes, and in
   those cases he pays about 45 percent more, because of an arrangement in
   which Mr. Hayes uses his students to care for the animals, Mr. Van
   Andel said.

   As for the action against Mr. Hayes, Mr. Mogulof said Mr. Fleming has
   no idea of what might be causing a financial shutdown of Mr. Hayes's
   lab, but suggested the possibility that he simply ran out of money.

   Mr. Hayes denied that, and said the crisis was threatening the health
   of thousands of his test animals, as well as his research into
   questions such as the variability of the effects of estrogen on
   different species of frogs. Those questions could help scientists
   answer important questions about how potential carcinogens could affect
   humans, and about the possibility of wide variations in effects
   depending on racial differences.

   Mr. Huelsenbeck said he could not comment on the possibility of
   retaliation involving Syngenta and atrazine, but expressed sympathy for
   Mr. Hayes and his concerns about the costs of animal care at Berkeley.

   "The situation is complicated," he said. "Personally, I feel it is a
   tragedy that his program is paused."


   Clarification, 8/21/2013, 12:22 p.m.: The $25-million, five-year
   research agreement between Berkeley and Novartis was from 1998 until
   2003.
