[32]Watch the webcast in its original format

   In late October, Strata+Hadoop World returns to the Big Apple. This
   year, we have a wide range of topics, from real-world case studies to
   hard-core data science to the ethics and challenges of a connected
   society.

   Each year, in the weeks leading up to Strata, we assemble a set of our
   hottest topics and most anticipated speakers, and ask them to join us
   for a free preview event. It'll give you a taste of what to expect in
   New York, and introduce you to new ideas in big data, ubiquitous
   computing, and ground-breaking interfaces that change how we live,
   love, work, and play.

   For attendees, it's a chance to see what we're covering and decide on
   the can't-miss tracks you should attend; for everyone else, it's a
   chance to see what Strata is about and why you should attend.

About Alistair Croll

   Alistair has been an entrepreneur, author, and public speaker for
   nearly 20 years. He's worked on a variety of topics, from web
   performance, to big data, to cloud computing, to startups, in that
   time. In 2001, he co-founded web performance startup Coradiant
   (acquired by BMC in 2011), and since that time has also launched
   Rednod, CloudOps, Bitcurrent, Year One Labs, the Bitnorth conference,
   the International Startup Festival and several other early-stage
   companies.

   Alistair is the chair of O'Reilly's [33]Strata conference, Techweb's
   Cloud Connect, and the International Startup Festival. "[34]Lean
   Analytics" is his fourth book on analytics, technology, and

   chronic ADD by writing about far too many things at "[35]Solve For
   Interesting".

Machine Learning Applications: Recommendation Engines Using Multiple Behavior
Sources
Ted Dunning

   Machine learning constructs such as Recommendation engines take a
   simplistic approach to data modeling: a single kind of user interaction
   with a single kind of item is used to suggest the same kind of
   interaction with the same kind of item. In this talk Ted will cover why
   this approach is flawed and present an easily implemented
   recommendation architecture and implementation style that addresses
   these flaws.

About Ted Dunning

   Serial startup and artist and open-source innovator, particularly
   interested in large data systems and statistical modeling.

What Makes Us Human? A Tale of Advertising Fraud
Claudia Perlich

   We've all taken road trips, right? So imagine driving for 24 hours
   straight and passing a billboard every three seconds. Now imagine
   someone hijacks your car, blindfolds you and ties you down in the
   passenger seat, and you proceed on your road trip, oblivious to that
   onslaught of billboard messages zooming past. That, my friends, is a
   peek into a disturbing phenomenon of forced website visitation.

   We decided to look under the hood and a couple of things started to
   look really strange. In this talk we will highlight on:
     * The most predictive URL's all having only recently appeared in our
       data
     * They were equally predictive no matter whether we are advertising
       for a hotel chain, pizza, or running shoes
     * The co-visitation patterns between the sites seemed excessive and
       very unnatural

About Claudia Perlich

   Claudia Perlich serves as Chief Scientist at m6d and in this role
   designs, develops, analyzes and optimizes the machine learning that
   drives digital advertising to prospective customers of brands. An

   annual 40 Under 40 list. She has published numerous scientific
   articles, and holds multiple patents in machine learning and won many
   data mining competitions. Prior to joining m6d in February 2010,
   Claudia worked in Data Analytics Research at IBM's Watson Research
   Center, concentrating on data analytics and machine learning for
   complex real-world domains and applications. Claudia has a PhD in
   Information Systems from NYU and an MA in Computer Science from
   Colorado University. Claudia takes active interest in the making of the
   next generation of data scientists and is teaching "Data Mining for
   Business Intelligence" in the NYU Stern MBA program.

Real-time Recommendations for Retail: Architecture, Algorithms, and Design
Juliet Hougland and Jonathan Natkins

   Users are constantly searching for new content and to stay competitive
   organizations must act immediately based on up-to-date data. Outdated
   recommendations decrease the likelihood of presenting the right offer
   and make it harder to maintain customer loyalty. In order to provide
   the most relevant recommendations and increase engagement,
   organizations must track customer interactions and re-score
   recommendations on the fly.

   In this webcast talk, we'll highlight how developers can use open
   source components like HBase and Kiji to develop low-latency
   recommendation models that can be easily deployed by e-commerce
   companies. We will give practical advice on how to choose models and
   design data stores that make use of the architecture and quickly serve
   new recommendations.

About Juliet Hougland

   Juliet Hougland is a Member of Technical Staff on the Product
   Engineering team at WibiData. She develops tools that enable data
   scientists to seamlessly develop and deploy real-time predictive
   models. She holds a B.A. in Mathematics-Physics from Reed College and a

Leveling Up With Hadoop: How Blizzard's Business Intelligence Supports The
Worlds of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo
Brian Griffith and Amanda Gerdes

   At Blizzard Entertainment, our business intelligence team helps users
   make data-driven decisions. One of the most interesting kinds of
   analysis we do is to look at in-game mechanics and features. We can
   tease out subtle insights from the petabytes of data from the many
   disparate data sources we have and we can feed those insights back to
   the game develop teams to make every player's experience epic.

   The webcast talk will higlight the critical role users' needs play in
   the design, implementation, and adoption of Hadoop within a
   fast-moving, dynamic environment that supports three Triple A game
   titles and all supporting business units.

About Brian Griffith

   Brian Griffith's career spans more than twelve years in the software,
   financial, and entertainment industries. Prior to Blizzard, he was the
   lead DBA and data warehouse engineer for Eastern Bank, integrating
   disparate systems into a single, secure enterprise data system.
   Currently at Blizzard, he works passionately with vast amounts of data
   to help game designers make their games even more epic. He holds a B.S.
   and an M.S. from Northeastern University, specializing in neuroanatomy
   and statistics. His Blood Elf paladin wears pink armor.

About Amanda Gerdes

   Amanda Gerdes is a data engineer with Blizzard Entertainment, focusing
   on the Blizzard Data Warehouse and its many supporting data pipelines.
   With eight years of experience in ETL development and management, she
   currently rounds out a team responsible for providing fast, accurate
   data at scale to Blizzard's Business Intelligence team. Amanda holds a
   B.A. from UC Berkeley as well as an MBA and M.S. in Systems Engineering
   from Loyola Marymount University. Whenever she catches herself thinking
   that maybe she's not doing too badly at this "life" thing, she looks up
   her World of Warcraft playtime in the data warehouse and is humbled
   once again.

Interactive Visualization of "Big" Data
Jeffrey Heer

   When the number of data elements gets large, standard visual
   representations and interaction techniques break down. In this webcast
   talk, we will highlight survey methods for scaling interactive
   visualizations to data sets too large to process or explore using
   traditional means. Attendees will hear about effective visualization
   techniques and interaction methods that are applicable to billion+
   element databases.

About Jeffrey Heer

   Jeffrey Heer is a co-founder and CXO (Chief Experience Officer) at
   Trifacta, a start-up company creating new tools for enhancing the
   productivity of data analysts. He is also a professor of Computer
   Science at Stanford University, where he leads the Stanford
   Visualization Group. His group has created a number of popular tools,
   including D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) and Data Wrangler. In Fall
   2013, Jeff will join the faculty of Computer Science & Engineering at
   the University of Washington. In 2009 Jeff was named to MIT Technology
   Review's TR35; in 2012 he was named a Sloan Foundation Research Fellow.
   He holds BS, MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University
   of California, Berkeley.
