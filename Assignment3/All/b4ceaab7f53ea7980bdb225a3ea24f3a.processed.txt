   Koch Industries will not be buying the Tribune Company's eight
   newspapers, which include the Chicago Tribune and the LA Times, The
   Daily Caller has learned.

   Sources with knowledge of the business proceedings told The Daily
   Caller that Koch Industries, after conducting its due diligence, has
   not been interested in buying the newspapers for "a couple months."

   The company determined that purchasing the newspapers was "not
   economically viable" and that both parties walked away from the
   negotiations, they said.

   Two of the Tribune Company's digital assets in particular,
   CareerBuilder.com and Classified Ventures LLC., a source with knowledge
   of the proceedings told The Daily Caller, were discovered to be half of
   the company's revenue.

   "They're basically such an important part of the revenue," the source
   confirmed, "in a way that if they sold them, it goes away."

   The Wall Street Journal [63]reported in June that due to what is dubbed
   a [64]founders' agreement, "a sale of the newspapers could invalidate
   long-standing arrangements under which Tribune's papers sell local ads
   on behalf of the websites, boosting the papers' digital ad revenue."

   Without the current revenue stream provided to the newspapers by
   CareerBuilders.com and Career Ventures LLC, the newspapers are
   unsustainable, the source said to The Daily Caller.

   "The founders' agreement is the problem," said the source.

   Since Peter Liguori, former Discovery Communications chief operating
   officer, [65]took the helm as Tribune Company's new CEO following its
   [66]emergence from bankruptcy, he has pushed the company's focus
   further towards broadcasting and cable.

   The Tribune Company [67]announced on July 1 a $2.73 billion all cash
   deal to buy Local TV LLC, which would add 19 stations in 16 markets to
   the company's portfolio and make it the largest the nation's largest
   commercial television station owner.

   On July 10, Tribune Company [68]announced that it planned to spin off
   the publishing business into a separate company, Tribune Publishing
   Company, furthering Liguori's vision to delve further into television
   media.

   Chicago Tribune [69]wrote that the move by the Tribune Company,
   however, "likely pushes back any potential sale of the publishing
   assets" until some time in 2014.

   Koch Industries Chairman & CEO Charles Koch had [70]told the Wichita
   Eagle the previous day that the potential purchase of the newspapers
   was "not on the front burner" for his company but "still possible."

   Progressive activists opposed to the business and political activities
   of Koch Industries' leadership -- Charles Koch and Executive Vice
   President David Koch -- heavily [71]dreaded the potential purchase and
   organized protests against the business deal.

   The Hartford City Council also [72]passed a resolution on August 12
   opposing what its progressive members feared as a takeover by the
   Kochs' of Tribune, which owns the local Hartford Courant.

   The resolution, introduced on May 28, was raised by members of the
   council's Working Families Party,  whose political affiliations have
   been traced to organizations such as defunct Association of Community
   Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) and the Service Employees
   International Union (SEIU).

   When the Tribune Company announced the spin off of the newspapers,
   Kochs' critics speculated whether the move was meant to deter their
   ideological foes from purchasing a media property.

   But a source with knowledge of the proceedings between the two
   companies told The Daily Caller that the decision to end the
   negotiations came from a recognition that the deal would be unfavorable
   for both parties involved.

   Another source confirmed that Koch Industries is still interested in
   purchasing media properties. Koch Industries declined the Daily
   Caller's request for comment.

   Tribune Company spokesman Gary Weitman declined the Daily Caller's
   request for comment, stating, "As a policy matter we do not comment on
   speculation about the company or its businesses."

   Correction: Peter Liguori was the former chief operating officer
   of Discovery Communications, not the Disney Communications as
   previously reported.
