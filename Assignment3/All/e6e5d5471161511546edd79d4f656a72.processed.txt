ONUG to Test Existence of SDN, Not Just Performance

   by [12]Kevin Fogarty | August 12, 2013

A test bed designed to separate real technology from slideware in a market
drowning in hype.

   The Open Networking User Group is calling for software-defined
   networking vendors to pitch in for a test bed that will allow end-user
   companies to try out esoteric network architectures.

   [13]ONUG announced today that it needs 10 networking vendors to help
   set up a temporary facility to test the performance, stability,
   reliability and functionality of software-defined network (SDN)
   products, the results of which will be presented at the two-day ONUG
   Fall meeting (Oct. 29-30 in New York).

   Test-bed networks that let network architects and managers play with
   cutting-edge networking products are routine at enterprise network
   conferences, but the intent of this one has a little more edge than
   most, according to ONUG co-founder and Chairman Nick Lippis.

   Rather than just helping vendors demonstrate how well their products
   play with others in realistic network configurations, the ONUG SDN
   network virtualization test is designed to help confused network
   architects and managers tell the difference between products built
   mainly from hype and those genuinely ready for production networks.

   "As IT business leaders begin piloting and deploying open networking
   solutions, scalability, reliability, performance, and feature
   verification of available solutions have arisen as critical issues,"
   Lippis wrote in a release announcing the testing plan.

   Simply put, software-defined networking is so new and so broadly
   defined that it is difficult for many companies to get a realistic idea
   of what SDN can do for them, let alone which products or combination of
   products could get them close to those goals.

   Rather than just helping them choose products for pilot tests, the SDN
   Test Suite is designed to identify realistic expectations for
   performance, scale and functionality to keep end-user companies from
   wasting time testing products that wouldn't meet their needs even if
   they worked perfectly.

   Eighteen percent of large corporations already use some form of
   fabric-based network - a prerequisite for SDN, according to 1,750 IT
   decision makers [14]polled by British market-research firm Vanson
   Bourne.

   Another 51 percent plan to roll out some Ethernet-based fabric during
   the next year, even as 91 percent said their IT infrastructures would
   have to be upgraded to properly support network virtualization, the
   study showed.

   Of course, they may be wrong. An April survey of senior-level network
   managers conducted by Swedish SDN provider Tail-F systems showed 91
   percent were aware of the term SDN, but only 51 percent could pick the
   right definition of it from a list.

   Even telecom providers, who are far less risk-averse about new network
   technology than end-user companies, are still limiting themselves to
   SDN evaluations [15]within "contained domains" where they can test and
   experiment with SDNs rather than building virtualization directly into
   the core of their networks, according to Infonetics Research founder
   Michael Howard. "Momentum for more widespread use of SDN and NFV
   [network function virtualization] is strong," he said. "Even so, we
   believe it'll be many years before we see bigger parts or a whole
   network controlled by SDNs."

   That's the point of testing for reality rather than simply for
   performance, [16]according to Lippis, whose Lippis Enterprises will run
   a test bed beginning Sept. 30 with approximately 5,000 hypervisors,
   100,000 virtual machines and 50 or so servers. The results--and the
   scripts to make the virtual networks operate--will be released under
   open-source licenses at ONUG's fall meeting.

   "What I want to find out is which companies are real," Lippis told
   SDNCentral.
