[4]Do we lose intelligence and creativity as we grow older?

   It was popular during the XXth century to say that most scientific
   discovery are done by young scientists (under 30). The implicit
   assumption was that the brain decayed over time, like an apple left to
   rot. The most recent research contradicts this unavoidable decay. While
   it was once believed that we progressively lost brain cells as we grew
   older, we now know that we do grow new neurons all the time ([5]Shors
   et al., 2012). While some people lose their intellectual edge over
   time, many older individuals do not experience any intellectual decline
   (even at age 80). In fact, over the 20th century, older people have
   taken a greater and greater share of the discoveries ([6]Jones, 2005):

     Whereas early research typically showed a decline in productivity
     after the ages of 40 to 45 years, this decline has been absent in
     more recent studies. ([7]Stroebe, 2010)

   It does seem that older scientists are less likely to come up with new
   paradigms. But this may have nothing to do with biological decay:

     (...) at a relatively early stage both the accumulation of knowledge
     and the establishment of fixed habits of thought may begin to reduce
     the ability to create radical new abstract ideations that is key to
     important conceptual innovations. ([8]Weinberg, 2005)

   It seems to me that you have options if you want to plan to be an older
   intellectual:
     * As you grow older, seek to best exploit your existing knowledge:
       leave radical new ideas to the younger generation.
     * From time to time, drastically change your intellectual habits to
       keep your brain young.

    1. I've always been thinking that all things being equal, the real
       productivity killer is the fact that when people get older, it's
       usually means they have more responsibilities, a growing family
       (especially in academia when permanent and stable position tend to
       be reached around 35-40, the family stuff comes later, the babies
       around 40-42) which takes all your free time and your energy.
       Anyway, academics tends to stabilize around 35-40. Then the time it
       takes for the kids to leave you alone (or divorce to arrive) you
       can easily go up to 47-50. Then miraculously comes back the
       productivity, the creativity they're talking about in that study.
       Yeah, yeah, it's a rant from a family dad who gave up yet another
       deadline because everyone was sick for weeks in his family.
       My brain is fine, not my sleep and certainly not my peace of mind.

    2. There was an old science fiction story with the premise that once
       you did anything sufficiently creative, the world conspired to
       prevent that from happening again. The story was firmly
       tongue-in-cheek ... but perhaps not entirely far from the truth. :)

    3. Thank you for posting this.
       I don't feel the least bit less creative as I enter my 40s.
       On the contrary, I have more experiences and examples to build off
       of, remix, etc.
       You don't have to think outside of the box.
       Especially if you have lots of boxes to try.

    4. Lots of boxes... Yeh.
       Read up on the social/cognitive psychology work in the last couple
       years. In theory I have all the factors that contribute to
       neuroplasticity, and the development of the ultrafast pathways. In
       practice, I find that I have usually reached a conclusion before a
       coworker has finished phrasing the question.
       But most of my time seems to go to explaining old solutions, yet
       again. And again. And again.
       WTF??
       Yes, I know that intelligence has an average. But I thought... long
       ago... er, nevermind.

    5. Be careful about using specific small facts from other disciplines
       as if they were general facts. Most of the data we have on
       neurogenesis come from mice hippocampus, a structure very useful in
       short-term memory, but those memory are later some-how moved to the
       cortex (at least in human, see case of HM) which is central to
       cognition. Evidences of neurogenesis in the human adult cortex are
       much weaker as far as I know, but I may not be up-to date.

       It does not seem like there is much human cortical neurogenesis in
       general, but there is growing evidence of neurogenesis in the human
       cortex following damages:

     the present current data indicate the presence of a regional
     regenerative response in human cerebral cortex (Nakayama et al.,
     2009)
       Why isn't there measured cortical neurogenesis in healthy human
       beings? A related question is whether normal cell losses in the
       cortex cause cognitive decline. It seems that there is no evidence
       that it does. So it could be that we simply don't normally require
       cortical neurogenesis. But when we do, our body is able to provide
       it.
       I don't think that I misrepresent the research: we did go from a
       belief that damages to the brain were hopeless to a much more
       optimistic outlook.

    7. I don't have any data to back this up, but I thought lots of people
       picked up painting or other creative means as they retired.
