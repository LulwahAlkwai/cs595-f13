   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   Galaxy Gear vs. Pebble. From my perspective the Pebble is the better
   watch.
   If you read through the Gizmag review (link below) you'll see the two
   watches are very different but the Pebble is the better watch with 7
   days of battery life and it is far more robust. The Samsung has a
   camera and far more capability (you can make calls on it for instance)
   but is relatively fragile, has far less battery life (some reports
   suggest single digit hours) and it costs twice as much. If you start
   with the core features and recognize both products will likely feel
   obsolete in months $150 for what will better replace your watch makes
   the Pebble a better deal. Full comparison here:
