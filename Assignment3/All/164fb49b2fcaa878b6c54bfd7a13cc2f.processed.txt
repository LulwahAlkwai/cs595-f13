   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   Google Patents Invading Email User's Privacy. Yes they patented being
   Scroogled.
   You can say a lot of things about this company but not having balls
   isn't one of them. Apparently they not only patented the process to
   mine Gmail accounts but took shots at Microsoft in the patent likely
   because Microsoft had been calling the process being "Scroogled". At
   some point though I think the company may need to lose a little of the
   testosterone and gain a little maturity because taking shots at a
   competitor in a patent doesn't exactly look mature even though I have
   to admit it would be kind of fun to do, thing is that it gave them more
   ink on a practice that post Snowden likely gives a lot of us concerns.
   But stupid or not, doing this certainly wasn't timid. Story in GeekWire
