[18]DNA has limits, but so does study questioning its value, geneticists say

   04 Apr 2012 | 06:00 BST | Posted by [19]Erika Check | Category:
   [20]Biology & Biotechnology, [21]Health and medicine, [22]Science
   communication

   Scientists are irked over a paper claiming, as The New York Times
   reported on Monday, that "[23]DNA's power to predict illness is
   limited."  "Yes," geneticists have replied. "What else is new?"

   Geneticists don't dispute the idea that genes aren't the only factor
   that determines whether we get sick; many  of them agree with that
   point. The problem, geneticists say, is not that the study, published
   on 2 April in [24]Science Translational Medicine, arrived at a false
   conclusion, but that it arrived at an old, familiar one via
   questionable methods and is now being [25]portrayed by the media [26]as
   a new discovery [27]that undermines the value of genetics. Here are the
   main criticisms of the new study and the resulting press coverage:

   1. This study critiques the power of genomic medicine but does not
   contain any genome data. The paper is titled, "The predictive power of
   personal genome sequencing," but it doesn't include any sequence data.
   Instead, the authors analysed data on how often twins developed the
   same diseases. Because twins have very similar genomes but don't always
   develop similar ailments, the authors, led by Bert Vogelstein and
   Victor E. Velculescu of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center in
   Baltimore, Maryland, assumed that the frequency with which the twins
   got the same illnesses reflects the power of their underlying genome
   sequences to determine their health. This assumption is not true (see
   point 4), and isn't a good basis on which to dismiss the value of
   genome sequencing in the absence of data from large genome-sequencing
   studies, which are just now getting underway.

   "Let's fast-forward a year or two, when we've sequenced a million or
   two million people in whole-genome sequencing studies," says Eric
   Topol, a cardiologist at Scripps Health in La Jolla, California, and
   author of The Creative Destruction of Medicine: How The Digital
   Revolution Will Create Better Health Care. "Then let's see whether or
   not the predictive capacity is limited, or limited for certain
   conditions but not others."

   2. This study is beating a dead horse. [28]Many other studies have
   already found that [29]genes alone don't predict a person's risk for
   developing most diseases very well. They've also specifically
   [30]questioned the value of commercial genetic tests that promise to
   reveal users' risk for various illnesses. The new study doesn't
   acknowledge any of the [31]previous studies[32] that have already
   arrived at the same answer and have done a better job of it,
   geneticists say (see point 3).

   3. The mathematical model used in the study is unrealistic. Geneticists
   have developed a slew of mathematical models that try to predict how
   likely a person is to develop various diseases. Scientists debate how
   well these models work, but the models are largely based on how
   diseases actually behave in the real world. The Vogelstein-Velculescu
   model is not, say statisticians.

   Vogelstein, Velculescu and their colleagues first developed a model
   that poses a theoretical idea of how diseases might behave. They then
   tested their model against data from twin studies. The model divides
   the universe of human genomes into 20 groups, or "genometypes." Each of
   the genometypes encodes a certain disease risk and occurs with a
   certain frequency, but the authors don't know how often different
   genometypes carrying various disease risks occur. To figure this out,
   they ask which combinations of disease risk and genometype frequency
   are realistic by comparing them to what they actually see in twin
   studies.

   The problem with this approach, statistical geneticists say, is that it
   uses flawed data to test unrealistic assumptions. Geneticists know how
   often certain genetic risk variants for various diseases occur in the
   general population, and how much risk each of these variants confers.
   The new model ignores this information, and instead allows diseases to
   behave in ways that differ from how they behave in real life. "The
   particular parameters in the model don't really correspond to anything
   in terms of real world behaviour of genetic risk variants," explains
   Luke Jostins, a statistical geneticist at Cambridge University, UK.
   "This divorces the model from population-genetic plausibility, making
   the results potentially meaningless."

   By ignoring information about how diseases act in the real world, the
   new model also allows the authors to sidestep some controversial
   unanswered questions, such as [33]whether standard models overestimate
   the genetic contribution to disease in twin studies. That could be a
   nice feature of the model, geneticists say. But because of the
   limitations of twin data, combined with the authors' flawed analysis of
   these data (see point 4), there's nothing in the paper to ground the
   new model in reality. If this were the first-ever paper to try to
   define the limits of genetic-disease prediction, it wouldn't be
   convincing, says Jostins, who also blogs at [34]Genomes Unzipped. "It's
   very hard to interpret this model," he says.

   4. The study doesn't correct for errors that can affect twin studies.
   The study assumes that genetics is the sole factor that determines
   whether two twins develop the same disease. But twins also grow up in a
   common environment, and the study doesn't account for this, as the
   authors admit.

   It's also rare for both members of a twin pair to develop the same
   disease. So even a study such as this, which combines data from many
   different twin studies, suffers from a relatively small overall sample
   size of affected twins. That lowers the statistical reliability of its
   findings and introduces unpredictable errors into the study, Jostins
   says. Again, there are ways to account for for these errors, but this
   study doesn't try to do that.

   5. The media coverage of the study could weaken support for genetic
   research. Geneticists have [35]lobbed some pretty heavy artillery at
   the Science Translational Medicine study, even though it claims to
   affirm what they already know. That's because the new study has
   received more press coverage than your run-of-the-mill statistical
   genetics paper, and geneticists are concerned that the coverage has
   overblown the study's conclusions in ways that could harm public
   support for science. "I don't see the harm in telling the public yet
   again that there is no such thing as genetic determinism," says Leonid
   Kruglyak a geneticist at Princeton University in New Jersey. "But I
   worry about the message being distorted to mean that genes have no
   value, or that genetic research is not worthwhile."

                Valid comments, I agree with them!

                When next generation DNA sequencing will be applied to to
                various ethnic DNA collections, the signal to noise ratio
                will increase as well as the predictive value of whole
                genome DNA sequencing!

                Sadly, I also saw on a media report a comment from a woman
                with a serious cardiac mutation--known in her family, and
                she has already tested positive. She seemed to think that
                discounting and undermining genetic testing was a huge
                relief. That could be an unfortunate conclusion if she
                blows off her test result now.

                            Yeah. It's on the CNN article called A warning
                            against genetic testing in case the link
                            doesn't work after I post it.

                            Here's the comment that disturbed me: "After
                            my brother went into cardiac arrest brought on
                            by a hereditary disease, I was tested for the
                            gene, hoping and praying I didn't have it.
                            Unfortunately I do and I've been living with
                            this fear I'm going to have the same problems.
                            This article is good news to me. It takes some
                            of the fear of the unknown away."

                So who is being irresponsible here? Are we, as scientists,
                considering the impact of over-interpretation of our work?
                Is it the job of the reviewers to treat all submissions as
                potential dynamite? What about the editorial inertia? Is
                it the place of the scientific journalist to dig deeper?
                What about the more popular press that picks up a science
                sound byte or two? It seems to me that while we all share
                some responsibility, there is a hierarchy and it starts
                with the originating scientist(s). There is some level of
                conflict of interest at each stage but the source has most
                to gain (and lose) and must be transparent. But the
                reviewers must also recognize that authors have to "sell"
                their work, especially if it is controversial or
                anti-dogma. How much role did the editors play? For all we
                know, the reviewers expressed major concerns and were
                overruled (transparency efforts at EMBO include publishing
                the review history and documentation - but only for
                published articles). It's certainly a good sign that some
                scientific journalists take to time to parse the
                complexities of experimental design and data analysis but
                they should not be expected to "police" research. Indeed,
                as soon as they do, it is a red flag that our vetting
                system has failed.

                One of the newer fields in genetic study, epigenetics, is
                attempting to bridge genetic causes of disease to
                environmental conditions. This would include lifestyle.
                One example would relate to the twin model where one twin
                develops disease and the other does not. Environmental
                conditions such as smoking, exposure to sunlight cause
                damage to the epigenome, cell factors that control gene
                expression. Therefore, having the same genetic makeup does
                not necessarily lead to development of the disease.
