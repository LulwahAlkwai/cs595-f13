The Mini Maker Faire kind of blew my mind

   I always wanted to attend the original [48]Maker Faire in the Bay Area
   and the annual shows that followed, but they started soon after I moved
   to Oregon and they never overlapped with my travel down there. I
   recently noticed they were touring around [49]Mini Maker Faires to
   different cities and I was delighted when my local science museum
   (OMSI) mentioned it was coming up this weekend. I bought tickets for my
   family and figured it'd be a lot like the parking lot at O'Reilly
   conferences I've attended: mostly nerds with their hobby gadgets, stuff
   like robots and rockets and a car converted to run on coffee grinds. My
   daughter is 8 now and we're always trying to push her towards having
   the best STEM education she can get and I figured this might be good
   for a few science demos. I planned to go on Sunday and looked at random
   Twitter/Flickr photos from the opening day on Saturday and saw only
   somewhat interesting looking robots and rockets and figured it'd
   probably take an hour to see it all and honestly I just hoped my
   daughter wouldn't be bored by the dry presentation of it.

   I got it all hopelessly, completely wrong, and it kind of blew my mind
   a bit.

   First off, my estimate of spending an hour with a bored child turned
   out to be showing up soon after it opened followed by forcing ourselves
   to leave about 90min before closing. It was incredible, they had a huge
   variety of demonstrations that covered not only all aspects of science,
   but also art, anthropology, cooking, and even some swords and archery.
   The demos were well-tailored to a young audience but were also fun for
   adults (I got to make my own pewter coin!). Another aspect I thought
   was handled well was the mixture of commerce and education. Many of the
   demos were done by local businesses and they sometimes offered stuff
   you could buy to do more of the same thing at home. This could have
   gone very wrong and seemed really crass if vendors only showed up in an
   effort to sell their junk disguised as a science demo, but it worked
   out well where if you really liked making a bit of fresh cheese in a
   booth, you could buy a cheesemaking kit for doing larger batches in
   your own kitchen.

   [50]Screen Shot 2013-09-16 at 2.23.04 PM Lastly, the thing that really
   blew my mind was [51]seeing my daughter learn how to solder and
   assemble basic electronics by building what was a essentially [52]a LED
   throwie. The LED Throwie is a small battery, a magnet, and a few LED
   lights that experimental graffiti artists came up with at [53]Eyebeam
   and plans on how to make them launched on the early [54]Instructables
   website. I recall Throwies pissed off a lot of major cities as random
   blinking lights started appearing on their public metal sculptures. I
   remember watching Throwies blow up in popularity while [55]Jonah
   Peretti was at Eyebeam, who likely used those lessons to help push
   content viral when he started Buzzfeed and Huffington Post later on.
   Then I thought about [56]Tim O'Reilly always watching the alpha geeks
   at the edges, knowing those people are 3-5 years ahead of the curve and
   that we could look to what they were interested in as what the
   mainstream would someday be into, and how today's Mini Maker Faire was
   a lot like the Emerging Technology conferences I attended 5+ years ago.
   I also thought about [57]Dale Dougherty & [58]Mark
   Frauenfelder launching Make Magazine that turned into this.

   It was amazing to see what was once an experimental graffiti project
   loved and hated around the world morph into a simple teaching tool for
   kids that could expose them to science, art, and fun by letting them
   create a small blinking object they could pin on their clothes. This
   all grew from geek hobbyists in a parking lot much like the one I stood
   in today, and the magazine that launched from that. The Mini Maker
   Faire quite literally was helping pass along the wonder and knowledge I
   saw over the last decade to a new generation of Makers.

   Needless to say, if you're a parent and one of the Mini Maker Faires is
   in your town, by all means do everything you can to attend one; you'll
   have a great time.

       I was stuck in my rocketry club's booth on both days, except for a
       brief ten-minute photo tour. But the Faire kind of came to us: It
       was really neat seeing kids with their DIY blinky-badges and coins
       show up at our booth.
       I only learned to solder a few years ago, after attending the big
       San Mateo Faire; I felt so left out after seeing all the neat stuff
       going on that I bought a bunch of teach-yourself kits. Those badge
       workshops are a great idea: Get them introduced to the idea early,
       with the product being a cool souvenir to bring home.
