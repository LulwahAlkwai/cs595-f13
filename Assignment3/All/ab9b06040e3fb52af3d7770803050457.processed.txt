Google vs. Death

How CEO Larry Page has transformed the search giant into a factory for
moonshots. Our exclusive look at his boldest bet yet -- to extend human life

   Larry Page, 40, is the co-founder and CEO of one of the most
   successful, ubiquitous and increasingly strange companies on the
   planet. Google is, of course, in the search business, and, more
   important for its profitability, it is in the online-advertising
   business. But it's also in the driverless-car business, the
   wearable-computing business, and the business of providing Internet
   access to remote areas via high-altitude balloons, among countless
   others.

   Page prefers to refer to the search giant's more out-there ventures as
   moon shots. At the moment Google is preparing an especially uncertain
   and distant shot. It is planning to launch Calico, a new company that
   will focus on health and aging in particular. "In some industries,"
   says Page, who spoke exclusively with TIME about the new venture, "it
   takes 10 or 20 years to go from an idea to something being real. Health
   care is certainly one of those areas. We should shoot for the things
   that are really, really important, so 10 or 20 years from now we have
   those things done."

   The unavoidable question this raises is why a company built on finding
   information and serving ads next to it is spending untold amounts on a
   project that flies in the face of the basic fact of the human
   condition, the existential certainty of aging and death? To which the
   unavoidable answer is another question: Who the hell else is going to
   do it?
