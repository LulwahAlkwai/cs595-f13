The book has now been published by Cambridge University Press.
The publisher is offering a 20% discount to anyone who buys the hardcopy <A
href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/discountpromotion/?site_locale=en_US&code=L2MMD">
Here</a>.

By agreement with the publisher, you can still download it free from this page.
Cambridge Press does, however, retain copyright on the work, and we expect that you will obtain their
permission and acknowledge
our authorship if you republish parts or all of it.  We are sorry to have to mention this
point, but we have evidence that other items we have published on the Web have been
appropriated and republished under other names.  It is easy to detect such misuse,
by the way, as you will learn in Chapter 3.

<H3>Download Version 1.3</h3>
<P>
Below is a draft, evolving version of the MMDS book.  We have added <A href =
"http://cs.stanford.edu/~jure">Jure Leskovec</a>
as a coauthor.  There are two new chapters, on mining large graphs and dimensionality reduction.
A chapter on large-scale machine learning is expected soon.
<P>
There is a revised Chapter 2 that treats map-reduce programming
in a manner closer to how it is used in practice, rather than how it was described in the
original paper.  Chapter 2 also has new material on algorithm design techniques for map-reduce.
