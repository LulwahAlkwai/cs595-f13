   Mississippi sitting on $872 million of Katrina funds
   by Jen Hayden Sep 12, 2013 12:28pm PDT
   Eight years later, Mississippi is sitting on [3]nearly $1 billion in
   federal funds designated from Hurricane Katrina:

     The remaining $872 million is part of $5.5 billion Congress gave the
     state to rebound from Katrina, which struck in August 2005, killed
     238 people in Mississippi and caused tens of billions of dollars in
     damage, most heavily in coastal counties.

     More than half of the unspent money is tied up in a hotly debated
     plan to expand the state-owned Port of Gulfport, and millions more
     are allocated for projects that have yet to materialize.

     Critics also complain that some projects are far from the Katrina
     strike zone and don't seem to have a direct connection to recovery
     from the hurricane, while others have failed to take root or are not
     meeting promises of creating jobs.

     One of the projects -- a parking garage in Starkville near the
     Mississippi State University football stadium -- is more than 200
     miles from Katrina's landfall.

   The usage of Katrina-designated funds has been hotly debated, pretty
   much since Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. As [4]Media Matters noted in
   2007, the money has largely been redirected away from those who needed
   it most:

     On the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's August 29, 2005,
     landfall, the media have largely ignored reports that Mississippi
     Republican Gov. Haley Barbour, leading the recovery effort in the
     state, has repeatedly sought, and obtained, waivers from the
     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allowing the state
     to spend federal funds that would normally be reserved for low- to
     moderate-income residents on other projects. As a consequence, just
     20 percent of the $5.4 billion in Community Development Block Grants
     (CDBG) awarded to the state has been earmarked for programs designed
     to benefit Mississippi's low- to moderate-income Katrina victims --
     less than half of the 50 percent requirement mandated by Congress,
     according to a recent report by the Steps Coalition, an organization
     that monitors the Mississippi Homeowners Assistance Program.
     Moreover, the $1.1 billion in federal funds that have been earmarked
     for programs benefiting lower income residents have been distributed
     very slowly. As the Biloxi Sun-Herald reported on August 26, the
     Steps Coalition said the program has been deficient in "helping
     people of low-to-moderate incomes." Furthermore, investigative
     journalist Tim Shorrock wrote in an August 29 Salon.com article that
     the distribution of federal funding in Mississippi under Barbour
     "has been badly skewed toward wealthy homeowners."

   By comparison, Louisiana has already spent the vast majority of the
   funding it [5]received:

     As of March 31, Louisiana had spent about 91 percent of the $10.5
     billion it received under the program, according to reports it
     submitted to HUD.

   If Mississippi hates

   those in need so much -- then they can save the rest of the nation a
   bunch of tax dollars when the next hurricane hits and use that residual
   for re-fixing up the fund-raisers estates and still hate on those
   really, truly injured and in need.

   But it's spent a larger portion of the money.

   It (deservedly) got more money than the other states, which is probably
   why it has more on hand.

   It's the motto of every Southern state

   "thank god for Mississippi", so that particular state doesn't have to
   be ranked worst at any particular negative index.  Mississippi is
   always ranked last in everything. I'm glad i don't live there.

   Not just the southern states.

   There was a time not so long ago when if not for Mississippi,
   California would have been the bottom of the heap in education!
   Finally they broke the Prop 13 barrier and elected Jerry Brown. But for
   almost a decade.....

   Every year in high school in Georgia,

   we students would be handed the educational rankings notification from
   the county for our parents. And before taking it home, we'd read it.

   'Well, we're still beating Mississippi on the SATs. And the graduation
   rate. Wonder how Alabama's doing?'

   Mississippi: 51st in education.

   (No, really, DC gets its own line in the report...)

   miss. has so much casino money that it is no longer ranked last.  i

   You see, it's very simple:

   Those poor, brown, lazy people chose to live at very low altitudes,
   near to or below sea level.

   And they chose to inhabit one-story, less well constructed houses, in
   neighborhoods where they could afford to eke out a life without
   personal transportation.

   And they chose not to evacuate when their authorities ordered [DEL:
   delayed :DEL] [DEL: mentioned :DEL] [DEL: gave them no access to :DEL]
   evacuation.

   So any damage or physical or mental harm they experienced was their own
   fault.  Completely and totally their fault.  (Did we mention that some
   of them were Teh Gay?)

   So the people who can really use that money as it was meant to be used
   will use it to build casinos and parking garages and sports arenas well
   out of the way of future storm surges.

   You see?  With the right [DEL: wing nut job :DEL] mind-set, it's all
   very clear.

   This is a travesty. The good people of this

   state deserve better.

   I was in Biloxi less than a week before Katrina hit.  Basically
   everywhere I had visited-destroyed.  Just gone. Along with homes &
   businesses.  Distant relatives who live there reported horrors that
   never made the MSM...

   What is wrong with these politicians???  Have they no shame?

   Ah, the hypocrisy of "fiscal conservatives"

   rings its ugly head again.

   See, actual fiscal conservatives would return that balance as it was
   not used.

   I'm sure there are projects that could be completed that have at least
   some connection to the aftermath of hurricane Katrina.  A football
   stadium parking garage 200 miles away from the impact zone is not one
   of them.

   Louisiana Sitting on a $BILLION

     As of March 31, Louisiana had spent about 91 percent of the $10.5
     billion it received under the program, according to reports it
     submitted to HUD.

   That means Louisiana is still stitting on about $945 million.

   Haley Barbour funnelled a lot of that money...

   ... to his brother Jeppie, who set himself up as a building
   corporation.  And they built condos with it in areas that hadn't been
   hit by the storm.  I live in Mississippi and we know about this, and
   still a lot of my fellow citizens happily voted for that con artist,
   all because he's white, fat, has the same dumb hee-haw accent they do
   and  mentions "Jesus" every chance he gets.  He's an embarrassment to
   the state, but unfortunately he got replaced by a guy who's not much
   better.

   You want corruption, just come to a red state... it's the only thing
   Republicans are good at.

   Math?

   Per the article -

   LA spent 91% of $10.5B....leaving a balance of $945M - 9%

   MS spent $4.6B of their $5.5B...$872M is 16% of their total.

   Is there really a difference?

   LA has more cash, MS has a bigger percentage.

   11% of funds allocated for relief has been idle for 8 years....that's a
   scandal.

   Thanks to Scout for posting this.

   For 8 years I have done [46]watchdog and [47]advocacy work on
   Mississippi's use of these funds. Later today, a state legislative
   watchdog [48]agency will release an analysis of jobs and restoration at
   State Port at Gulfport. Gov. Bryant [49]fought for months to bottle
   this report up.

   A dollar saved is a dollar spurned

   Well, to be fair, that $872 million is about 16% of $5.5 billion the
   federal government gave to Mississippi, or about $1.70 left unspen for
   every dollar Louisiana's hung onto.

   More importantly is Mississippi's diversion of funds to projects that
   have little or nothing to do with the destruction wrought by Katrina.
   This borders on willful malfesance, and should be investigated by the
   Government Accountability Office and the office of the United States
   Attorney General.

   Check the banks where this money is deposited

   and their political donations (plus certain non-profits). That's always
   a key little side benefit for such delays, a legal laundering, as it
   were.
