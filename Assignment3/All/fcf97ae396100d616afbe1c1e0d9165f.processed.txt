   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   Congress: The US is stealing privacy from its citizens and taking away
   a fundamental liberty, fix this.
   Interesting piece today by Scott Cleland. He argues privacy is a
   constitutional right and that the current administration has
   effectively been stealing our privacy from us in violation of the
   constitution. The WW3 effort to preserve internet privacy has collapsed
   and apparently it is up to Congress to restore it. He also ties privacy
   to liberty and I agree with his arguments but given how effective
   Congress has been over the last decade or so I wouldn't hold my breath.
   Interesting take on the Daily Caller:
