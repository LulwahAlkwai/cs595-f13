   I have seen some writing where people have a list or a figure in
   writing and they will write something like this:

     The information is provided in Image 3:-

   Is that correct? Is this a British style?

   What is that? Some kind of weird unicorn-walrus emoticon? Narwhal?
   - [25]ghoppe Jun 22 '11 at 20:25
   That looks like a typo. The dash contributes nothing and should be
   eliminated. - [26]Mike DeSimone Jun 22 '11 at 21:03
   I don't think I've ever seen a colon followed by a hyphen, but I have
   seen it followed by a dash, especially before beginning a long list.
   @Marcin's answer mentions court documents, and I think that's where
   I've seen it too. - [27]TRiG Oct 20 '11 at 17:18

   According to Nick Marten's [32]The Secret History of Typography in the
   Oxford English Dictionary, a colon followed by a dash is a
   typographical mark that the OED refers to as the dog's bollocks:

     Citing usage from 1949, the OED calls this mark the dog's bollocks,
     which it defines as, "typogr. a colon followed by a dash, regarded
     as forming a shape resembling the male sexual organs." This is why I
     love scrounging around the linguistic scrap heap that is the OED. I
     always come across a little gold. And by "gold," I mean, "vulgar,
     60-year-old emoticons."

   Marten does not further elaborate on its purported usage, but
   [33]others do:

     In Britain the exclamation mark is sometimes referred to as a dog's
     prick, and that, further, the combination of a colon and a dash
     (:--), out of fashion now but long used to represent a restful
     pause, is known as a dog's bollocks.

   Modern style guides seem intent on banishing its usage to history. For
   example, the University of Sussex has a [34]strong opinion on the
   matter:

     The colon [is] never preceded by a white space; it is always
     followed by a single white space in normal use, and it is never,
     never, never followed by a hyphen or a dash -- in spite of what you
     might have been taught in school.

   I'd love to find some examples in print, but as you can imagine:-- it's
   extraordinarily difficult to google.

   When OED cites something this ridiculous, it becomes super-double-plus
   funny. - [39]horatio Oct 20 '11 at 18:06
   -1 "...in spite of what you might have been taught in school." How
   could it have come to be taught in school? There must be a time not so
   long ago when it was normal, if not the prescribed notation. I fail to
   see how the elaborate discussion is related to the question at hand.
   See Marcin's answer. - [40]Kris Oct 29 '12 at 15:11

   It's correct, because it is a recognised, well-known usage. However, it
   is redundant, and in most situations not the best or right usage. I
   would only use it where there is an established convention for its
   usage, such as in certain court documents.

   When you say, "it is a recognised, well-known usage", do you have some
   examples? As the OP suggested, perhaps it's used in the UK? I've never
   seen it in 40+ years of reading, including in court documents, but I'm
   in the US. - [45]Matthew Frederick Jun 22 '11 at 19:24
   @Matthew Frederick: Nothing to hand. I've seen it in old mathematics
   and computer science papers. The only place I see it now is in certain
   court documents, where it is conventional to use it, such as after the
   opening line of a witness statement or affidavit. - [46]Marcin Jun 22
   '11 at 19:28
   Think it used to be more common in the UK. Am guessing that it is now
   not used so much as part of a general trend to simplify punctuation.
   - [47]Neil Coffey Jun 22 '11 at 20:59
   @Neil Coffey: I think it is supposed to be stronger than an ordinary
   colon. - [48]Marcin Jun 22 '11 at 21:02
   yes I think that was probably the idea, and it's probably true if your
   medium is ye olde typewriting. These days, there are other
   typographical means (e.g. indenting bullet points in a list or
   indenting a quotation) to make up for the lack of "strength".

   This is brilliant guys, thanks - I am a [51](UK) fiction novel writer
   and I use this piece of grammar to indicate an attributive that
   finishes mid-sentence, with the actual quoted speech starting in the
   NEXT chapter.

   Ours is a digital story/publishing concept that requires this odd way
   of formatting, and no other piece of grammar is really up to the job as
   regards length of 'pause' and strength of intention as regards
   separating parts of a sentence that are important enough to warrant
   crossing chapters, so we brought it back, and liked the idea of
   recycling old grammar for a modern publishing concept.

   Having said that, it is generally considered archaic now, and looks too
   convoluted within a passage of text, and is, frankly, irritating to try
   and read past (IMHO) as it visually 'clogs things up' - especially in
   digital formats.

   As well, I have just read a collection (endorsed by Salman Rushdie, no
   less) that contains wide usage of DASHED commas, DASHED colons and even
   DASHED fullstops. What grammarians often forget is grammar is ALSO
   creative.
