Microbes help beetles defeat plant defenses

   Symbiotic bacteria living inside potato beetles causes plants to resist
   the wrong invader.

Microbes help beetles defeat plant defenses

   UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -- Some symbiotic bacteria living inside Colorado
   potato beetles can trick plants into reacting to a microbial attack
   rather than that of a chewing herbivore, according to a team of Penn
   State researchers who found that the beetles with bacteria were
   healthier and grew better.

   "For the last couple of decades, my lab has focused on induced defenses
   in plants," said [62]Gary W. Felton, professor and head of
   [63]entomology. "We had some clues that oral secretions of beetles
   suppressed defenses, but no one had followed up on that research."

   Seung Ho Chung, graduate student in entomology working with Felton,
   decided to investigate how plants identified chewers and how herbivores
   subverted the plants defenses.

   "I thought we could identify what was turning the anti-herbivore
   reaction off," said Felton. "But it was a lot more difficult because we
   had not considered microbes."

   According to Felton, the beetles do not have salivary glands and so
   they regurgitate oral secretions onto the leaves to begin digestion.
   These secretions contain gut bacteria.

   Plant defenses against chewing insects follow a jasmonite-mediated
   pathway that induces protease inhibitors and polyphenol oxidase, which
   suppress digestion and growth. Plant defenses against pathogens follow
   a salicylic acid mediated pathway. When the antimicrobial response
   turns on, it interferes with the response to chewing, allowing the
   beetles to develop more normally.

   Chung and Felton used tomato plants to identify exactly what was
   turning off the response to chewing. They note, however, that the
   Colorado potato beetle also attacks eggplant and potato plants. They
   report the results of their work in the current online edition of the
   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

   The researchers allowed beetle larva to feast on antibiotic-treated
   leaves and natural leaves and found that on the antibiotic-treated
   leaves, the beetles suffered from the plant's anti-herbivore defense,
   but on the natural leaves the larva gained more weight and thrived.

   Chung and Felton then investigated expression of genes in the
   anti-herbivore pathway and the production of enzymes. They found that
   the presence of bacteria decreases the anti-herbivore response.

   The researchers also isolated and grew the bacteria from the Colorado
   potato beetle guts. They found 22 different types of bacteria, but only
   three types suppressed the anti-herbivore response. During a variety of
   other experiments, they found that in all cases presence of the
   bacteria that could suppress the anti-herbivore response led to
   healthier beetles.

   The researchers are now beginning to see if these bacteria are present
   in Colorado potato beetles all over the U.S. and also in Europe.

   Also working on this project were Cristina Rosa, research associate in
   entomology; Erin D. Scully, graduate student in the intercollege
   program in genetics; Michelle Peiffer, research assistant in
   entomology; John F. Tooker, assistant professor of entomology; Kelli
   Hoover, professor of entomology and Dawn S. Luthe, professor of plant
   science.

   The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Science Foundation
   supported this work.
