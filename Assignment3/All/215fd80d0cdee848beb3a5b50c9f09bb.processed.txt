   Apple brings out a new top-of-the-line iPhone model every year, but a
   redesign only every other year. In the intervening cycles, the company
   tends to keep the phone's exterior the same, but changes the innards
   and the software. This is one of those in-between years, but the new
   iPhone 5s has a potentially game-changing hardware feature and a
   radically new operating system.
   image
   The iPhone 5s's reliable, easy Touch ID.

   The iPhone 5s is the first digital device I've seen with a simple,
   reliable fingerprint reader -- one you can confidently use, without a
   thought, to unlock the device instead of typing in a passcode. You can
   even use this fingerprint reader, called Touch ID, to authorize
   purchases from Apple's App, iTunes and e-book stores.

   It sounds like a gimmick, but it's a real advance, the biggest step
   ever in biometric authentication for everyday devices. After using
   Touch ID, I found it annoying to go back to typing in passcodes on my
   older iPhone.

   The new iPhone 5s, which starts at $199 with a two-year contract and
   goes on sale for all major carriers on Friday, has a beefier processor
   that Apple says can double its performance. And it has a better camera.

   Then there's the new operating system on this phone, called iOS 7. Its
   new look, new user interface and new functions represent the biggest
   overhaul to the iPhone's core software since the original model
   launched in 2007. Nearly everything has been improved, including
   multi-tasking, notifications, access to common controls, email, Web
   browsing and Siri. Like any big change, it's a shock at first, but I
   have come to like it and consider it a step forward, despite a few
   issues.

   The new iOS 7 won't just be limited to the 5s, or Apple's other new
   iPhone, the $99 iPhone 5c. It'll be a free, optional download starting
   on Wednesday for many older model iPhones and iPads.

   After a week of testing the iPhone 5s, I like it and can recommend it
   for anyone looking for a premium, advanced smartphone. If you are an
   iPhone fan with any model older than the iPhone 5, the new 5s will be a
   big step up. If you own an iPhone 5, there's less of a case for
   upgrading, unless you want the fingerprint reader and improved camera.
   You can get the new OS free of charge.
   image
   iOS 7 has simpler-looking icons.

Hardware

   The Touch ID fingerprint sensor is built into the iPhone's familiar,
   round Home button. To use it, you must first set up a passcode as a
   backup and then go through a brief training session for each finger you
   want to use. There have been laptops and at least one other phone with
   fingerprint sensors, but they have generally been unreliable and people
   tended to stop using them. Apple is using a different technology that
   turns the Home button (which still performs its usual functions) into a
   rapid, accurate finger scanner.

   A steel ring around the button detects your finger and then a sensor
   scans it. This sensor can identify your finger even if it's off-center
   or when the phone is in any position. It looks beneath the outer layer
   of skin, a capability Apple says means it won't work with dead tissue,
   such as a severed finger or a plastic fingerprint imprint -- favorite
   security workarounds seen in the movies. The detection process only
   takes a second or two.

   In my scores of tests, with three fingers, the reader never failed me
   and none of the 20 or so people I asked to test it was able to unlock
   the phone. If a finger match fails three times, the phone offers you a
   chance to type in your passcode instead. After five failures, it
   requires the passcode. Apple says the odds another person's finger
   would work are 1 in 50,000, versus 1 in 10,000 for breaking a
   four-digit passcode.

   There is one bug in the system: Sometimes, while trying to use a finger
   to authenticate an online purchase, the phone asks for a password.
   Apple says it expects to fix this bug very quickly.

   The iPhone 5s boasts something called a 64-bit processor, which means
   the system can process data in bigger chunks, and thus much faster. But
   I didn't notice any dramatic speed improvement, partly because few apps
   have yet to be rewritten to take advantage of it.

   The new camera is still 8 megapixels, but has a bigger sensor that
   allows for larger pixels that can capture more light and color
   information. It has a lens that lets in more light and a flash that
   allows for warmer tones in low light. All my pictures were slightly
   sharper than on the iPhone 5 and low-light pictures were much less
   washed out by the flash. The camera app has been improved, with a new
   burst mode that takes many shots quickly and then picks the best ones,
   and a slow-motion video feature that lets you choose parts of an action
   sequence to slow down. It worked seamlessly.

   Voice calls were excellent, even over Bluetooth in a car. I didn't do a
   formal battery test, but the iPhone 5s lasted a full workday, including
   one day where it still had 15 percent of battery left after 14 hours.
   image
   iOS 7 gives an overview of your day, such as weather and schedule.

Operating System

   There are too many new features in iOS 7 to list here, but it's a big
   improvement. The icons have been redesigned to be flatter and simpler,
   but they appear to float over your wallpaper, giving the effect of
   depth. Many elements are translucent, subtly changing shades to match
   the wallpaper color.

   The fonts are sharper, finer and more delicate. Buttons and controls
   are thinner and lighter and, in the browser, they disappear or shrink
   to make a little more room for content. Overall, the effect is to make
   the 4-inch screen seem larger.

   Any app now can be set to update in the background, though the system
   learns the ones you use most often and updates them intelligently to
   save battery.

   The phone now shows you thumbnails of every running app and you can
   quit any of them by just flicking upward, as in Palm's now-dead WebOS
   operating system.
   image
   The browser shows a stack of open tabs.

   The notification panel, which pulls down from the top, now gives you an
   overview of your day, including weather and schedule.

   And, taking a page from Android, the iPhone now has a quick-settings
   Control Center that pulls up from the bottom to control Wi-Fi,
   Bluetooth, music, brightness and other features. It even can turn on a
   flashlight function.

   The browser gives you a handsome graphical view of open tabs and the
   email program now downloads thousands of messages at once, letting you
   mark them all as read with a few clicks.

   I found Siri to be more accurate and useful. It now has an almost human
   voice and can glean answers from Bing, Twitter and Wikipedia.

   The photos app now automatically groups your camera roll by time and
   place. You can send photos with one tap to other iOS users nearby.

   In iTunes, there's now a Pandora-like radio feature.

   My biggest disappointment is that there have been only minor
   improvements to the keyboard. Unlike in Android, Apple still bars you
   from substituting third-party keyboards with better auto-correction.
   The company says this is due to security worries.

   Overall, however, the new iPhone 5s is a delight. Its hardware and
   software make it the best smartphone on the market.
