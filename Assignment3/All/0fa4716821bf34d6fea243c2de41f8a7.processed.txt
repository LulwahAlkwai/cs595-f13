[120]"Deaf" Frog Hears By Using Its Mouth As An Echo Chamber

   by Ed Yong

   Gardiner's frog shouldn't be able to hear. This dime-sized amphibian
   doesn't have the right equipment for it.

   In your head, sound waves pass through the flappy bits of your ear and
   vibrate a taut membrane--the eardrum. On the other side, three tiny
   bones transfer these faint air-borne vibrations into the fluid-filled
   inner ear, amplifying them along the way. In the inner ear, little
   hairs detect the vibrations and convert them into electrical signals
   that travel to your brain. This is how you hear, and it all depends
   upon the eardrum and the three bones within the so-called middle ear.
   Without these structures, 99.9 percent of the energy of incoming sound
   waves would be lost.

   Gardiner's frog doesn't have a middle ear or an eardrum. It ought to be
   deaf.

   And yet, it sings. When [121]Renaud Boistel used loudspeakers to play
   recordings of the frog's calls, other males would start calling in
   response. So, how does this "deaf" frog manage to hear? Boistel has a
   possible answer--they use their mouths.

   [123]Gardiner's frog is one of the smallest amphibians in the world. At
   its maximum size of 11 millimetres, it's barely bigger than a
   fingernail. It's part of a whole family of tiny frogs called
   [124]sooglossids, found in the Seychelles Islands off the east coast of
   Africa. All of them lack middle ears, but all of them can apparently
   hear their own calls.

   To find out how, Boistel's team at the University of Paris-Sud analysed
   the frog's skull with a very high-resolution X-ray scanner. This showed
   that the inner ear is completely surrounded by a capsule of bone, which
   might help to conduct incoming sound. But when they ran simulations of
   sound waves travelling through the frog's skull, they found that these
   were still severely weakened by the time they reached the inner ear,
   despite the adjacent bone.

   The simulations also ruled out another possible idea--that earless
   frogs might use their lungs to carry vibrations into their inner ears.
   That might be true for some species, but Gardiner's frog has small
   lungs that don't make good contact with its sides. They'd be terrible
   sound transmitters.

   But the team's simulations also revealed something odd--a burst of
   pressure within the frog's mouth. When the team added the animal's
   mouth to their simulations, they found that it resonates at a frequency
   of 5,738 Hertz. Sounds of this frequency cause the mouth to reverberate
   strongly, turning it into an amplifier.

   And guess what the average frequency of the frog's call is? It's 5,710
   Hertz--roughly an F note, four octaves above middle C.

   Gardiner's frog seems to have a mouth that's perfectly adapted for
   amplifying the calls of other Gardiner's frogs, compensating for the
   lack of a middle ear. And it probably helps that the tissues between
   the mouth and inner ear are unusually thin.

   This might explain why, in Boistel's playback experiments, Gardiner's
   frog reacts to the calls of its own kind, but not those of other frogs.
   Maybe its own calls are the only things it can hear.

   "The idea is fascinating," says [126]Albert Feng from the University of
   Illinois. He proposed a similar idea back in 2011, to explain how
   another tiny frog, the [127]Kihansi spray toad, could hear. However,
   Feng says the evidence that Boistel has provided is still tenuous and
   inconclusive, and he thinks they need to test their idea through
   experiments. For example, they might keep the frog's mouth open, or
   briefly fill it with moistened cotton balls to see if they can still
   hear.

       Obviously its not the same frog, but it is still funny that a few
       other use their ears to sing. (Well their tymanic membranes to
       radiate sound.) You have to admit its a nice functional symmetry.

       Great article Mr. Young.
       I am sure this could have great implications in the study of
       deafness in humans and may lead to some interesting new treatments.
       However is it not true that humans can also "hear" through their
       mouths via vibrations on their teeth. I want to say I read or heard
       this somewhere. Also could it not be possible that their
       simulations did not include the right data about the bone
       surrounding the middle ear of the frog?
       I am curious as to this bone, I do not know much about frogs or
       ears, but most parts of the body have use there are some exceptions
       to this of course, but to me it would seem not very productive for
       evolution to isolate the inner ear of an animal with out serving a
       special purpose for said animal, especially knowing they can still
       hear. Maybe the bone acts much as the hair in our ears, but they
       just receive sound through their mouths? I don't know just
       wondering if someone does. Again though this may have profound
       meaning in the study of human deafness and allow for some major
       advances in the area.

       Does this relate at all to the evolutionary origins of the middle
       ear bones?

       Humans can indeed hear sound via their teeth, there is even a line
       of novelty toothbrushes that plays music this way (ostensibly too
       encourage kids to brush).
          + Rdizzie
            September 3, 2013
            Yeah I have seen those toothbrushes but I thought they were
            some kind of novelty. I want to say back in the late 90's
            maybe the start of 2k I saw where people were having some sort
            of speaker implanted into their teeth or jaw bones. So I guess
            the novelty idea of the toothbrush was not so accurate. By
            novelty I mean that you could already hear them without
            putting in on your tooth and just being inside your mouth made
            it louder.
            I want to say that later in the 2k's there was talk of
            implanting cell phones in your teeth.

       Great article! It was very interesting to find out new facts about
       frogs. :)

       Very interesting article! I don't know much about frogs or ears so
       it's interesting to find out new facts about frogs. :)
