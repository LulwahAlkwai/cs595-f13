   By Neha Prakash2013-09-12 15:37:52 UTC

   Rejoice, muggles: The time has come for J.K. Rowling to Apparate us
   back into the world of wizards. The author of the [48]Harry Potter
   series is collaborating with Warner Bros. to develop a screenplay based
   on her novel Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

   Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was published in 2001 under the
   pseudonym Newt Scamander. The book was based on a textbook mentioned in
   the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

   The new film is neither a prequel nor sequel to the Harry Potter books;
   it's a standalone "extension of the wizarding world," Rowling said in a
   press release.

   "The laws and customs of the hidden magical society will be familiar to
   anyone who has read the Harry Potter books or seen the films, but
   Newt's story will start in New York, seventy years before Harry's gets
   underway," she said in the release.

   If we're lucky, maybe we'll get a namedrop of Hogwarts headmaster Albus
   Dumbledore or a battle between a Hippogriff, Thestral and Basilisk.

   Rowling said Warner Bros. approached her about turning the book into a
   film, but she felt wary of another writing producing it.

   "Having lived for so long in my fictional universe, I feel very
   protective of it and I already knew a lot about Newt," Rowling said.
   "As hard-core Harry Potter fans will know, I liked him so much that I
   even married his grandson, Rolf, to one of my favorite characters from
   the Harry Potter series, Luna Lovegood."

   It will be Rowling's screenwriting debut and the first film in a
   series.

   BONUS: [50]The Hogwarts Houses for Your Favorite TV Characters

Hogwarts Houses for Your Favorite TV Characters

    1. Gryffindor

Gryffindor
       Gryffindor is the house known for bravery. It's also Harry Potter's
       house, so all the cool kids want in.
       Image: Flickr, [51]Autumn2May
    2. John-snow-game-of-thrones

Jon Snow
       Jon Snow desperately wants to prove himself worthy, but he also
       values helping the weak and the mistreated.
       Image: [52]Tumblr, jennywilliamson
    3. Joan-mad-men

Joan Holloway
       Joan is ambitious, but it's her desire to help the less gifted
       secretaries and her pride in seeing them succeed that makes her a
       Gryffindor.
       Image: [53]Tumblr, frivolites-d-une-vintage-girl
    4. Daenerys-game-of-thrones

Daenerys Targaryen
       Daenerys is so fiercely ambitious she could definitely fit in
       sitting in the Slytherin common room, but it's her sense of
       justice, her desire to help people on her way up that makes her a
       lion.
       Image: [54]Tumblr, crazy-little-soul
    5. Britany-glee

Brittany Pierce
       Sometimes seen as the dumb one Brittany is a gleek who rises to a
       challenge or stands up to an injustice without fear.
       Image: [55]Tumblr, thankformakingmeafighter
    6. Manny-modern-family

Manny Delgado
       Gryffindor is the chivalrous house, and therefore the only house
       for Manny.
       Image: [56]Tumblr, idhateyourselftoo
    7. Watson-sherlock

John Watson
       John Watson has thrown himself in the line of danger to save his
       friends on multiple occasions, he's quiet but extremely brave.
       Image: [57]Tumblr, somethingsomethingnerdstuff
    8. Hufflepuff

Hufflepuff
       There should be no judging the individual houses, but you can
       definitely judge anyone who dubs Hufflepuff the dumb house.
       Qualities associated with the house of the badger include honesty,
       loyalty, and a strong value on friendship.
       Image: Flickr, [58]Autumn2May
    9. Phil-modern-family

Phil Dunphy
       At the end of the day, Phil just wants to make his family and
       friends happy. Sometimes his cheerfulness and optimistic outlook on
       life can make him seem a little addled, but that's really because
       he's so often surrounded by sarcasm.
       Image: [59]Tumblr, editingangels
   10. Big-bang-theory-penny

Penny
       Penny is a good, patient friend. Like, really patient.
       Image: [60]Tumblr, ge-em
   11. Cam-modern-family

Cam Tucker
       Cam is on the edge of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, but came up a
       little short as far a bravery goes (but he made up for it with a
       high level of friendliness).
       Image: [61]Tumblr, bucknellstruggles
   12. Troy-community

Troy Barnes
       All Troy really wants from life is to hang out with his best
       friend, and help him when he can.
       Image: [62]Tumblr, shewillmove-mountains
   13. Jess-new-girl

Jess Day
       Jessica Day is kind of the epitome of Hufflepuff. To show off her
       house spirit she would probably keep a badger as a pet (naming it
       Helga after the founder of course).
       Image: [63]Tumblr, theres-a-daisy
   14. Jesse-breaking-bad

Jesse Pinkman
       Jesse might be a meth dealer, but when you push past that he's just
       a sweet, friendly guy.
       Image: [64]Tumblr, vena-cava-x
   15. Nick-new-girl

Nick Miller
       Nick Miller would be a hard one to sort; he doesn't have the good
       work ethic of your average Hufflepuff, but he is loyal to his core
       group of friends.
       Image: [65]Tumblr, pressure-pressure
   16. Orange-is-the-new-black-piper

Piper Chapman
       Piper might be terrified in prison, but her first response is to
       befriend her fellow inmates. Gestures like using her commissary
       money to buy another inmate makeup shows that her demeanor isn't
       the sense of self-preservation a Slytherin would have, it's a
       genuine warmth.
       Image: [66]Tumblr, alexzvause
   17. Slytherin

Slytherin
       Let's get this out of the way first -- Slytherins are not all evil.
       Therefore, inclusion in this house does not denote evil-ness.
       Slytherins are ambitious. They see what they want and they go for
       it.
       Image: Flickr, [67]Autumn2May
   18. Don-mad-men

Don Draper
       Don wants success and money (and possibly love). He's going to
       charge towards them all mercilessly, only sometimes caring about
       who gets in his way.
       Image: [68]Tumblr, supermodelgif
   19. Tom-parks-and-rec

Tom Haverford
       It's not that Tom doesn't love his friends, it's just that he loves
       fancy clothes and his ability to buy [69]more fancy clothes.
       Image: [70]Tumblr, astylishman
   20. Arya-game-of-thrones

Arya Stark
       Arya's "thirst to prove herself," as the sorting hat would say, has
       morphed into an endless drive for vengeance. It's a bloodier
       ambition than most of the Slytherins on this list have, but it's
       still the trait that has come to define her.
       Image: [71]Tumblr, meezeh
   21. Schmitt-new-girl_0

Schmidt
       Schmidt's drive towards perfection (and nice suits) can sometimes
       hurt his ability to connect and be there for his friends.
       Image: [72]Tumblr, pewdsandcry
   22. Sue-glee

Sue Sylvester
       Sue reminds us that while Hufflepuffs are identified by their
       loyalty, Slytherins can be fiercely loyal to those they care about
       most. She might not care about crushing the entire glee club on her
       path to a Cheerio victory, but she was willing to give up
       everything to protect Becky.
       Image: [73]Tumblr, butlercat
   23. Walter-breaking-bad

Walter White
       Not all Slytherins are evil, but some are. And Walter's need to
       build an empire has twisted him into an evil person.
       Image: [74]Tumblr, moediddy52
   24. Santana-glee

Santana Lopez
       Santana looks out for Santana, and loved ones who are currently on
       her good side. She's not going to spare someone's feelings if she
       feels they need to see the truth of a situation.
       Image: [75]Tumblr, ohmyemmagleek
   25. Jeff-community

Jeff Winger
       Jeff is a Slughorn Slytherin, a genuinely nice guy who will help
       you out eventually, but first you'll have to get past his instinct
       to save himself. If left to his own devices he'd use his talents to
       live a comfortable life. But when someone calls him out, he'll try
       to do the right thing.
       Image: [76]Tumblr, fireball-mudflap
   26. Orange-is-the-new-black-alex

Alex Vause
       Alex showed ambition when she was running her drug ring, and spite
       when she named Piper at trial.
       Image: [77]Tumblr, oliviaswilde
   27. Ravenclaw

Ravenclaw
       Ravenclaws are super smart, but they're not going to rub your nose
       in it. They know how to use their intelligence for practical
       purposes, but they also enjoy the pursuit of knowledge.
       Image: Flickr, [78]Autumn2May
   28. Peggy-mad-men

Peggy Olson
       Peggy's ambition has developed over the years, and her loyalties
       have often changed or wavered, but no one can say she's not smart.
       Image: [79]Tumblr, jparx
   29. Abed

Abed Nadir
       Abed finds comfort in his encyclopedic knowledge of entertainment
       trivia, but it's not just his Scene It skills that make him a
       Ravenclaw -- it's also a house that values wisdom, and for all his
       ineptitude with social norms, he often figures out the lesson of an
       episode before the rest of the study group.
       Image: [80]Tumblr, newrhythm
   30. Sherlock

Sherlock Holmes
       With his reliance on logic, reason, and knowledge, Sherlock is a
       "hat barely touched his head" Ravenclaw.
       Image: [81]Tumblr, squid-of-science
   31. Big-bang-theory-sheldon

Sheldon Cooper
       Sheldon could have been in Slytherin with his thirst to be the top
       of his field, but in the end he doesn't want to be the most
       powerful person in the room, just the smartest.
       Image: [82]Tumblr, pajda6
   32. Ron-swason

Ron Swanson
       Ron's extreme [83]problem solving skills would earn him a spot in
       Ravenclaw.
       Image: [84]Tumblr, amusinggifs
   33. Girls

Shoshanna Shapiro
       Shoshanna takes a logical reproach to everything -- after all she
       has a mathematical mind.
       Image: [85]Tumblr, youretackyandihateyouu
   34. Girls-hannah

BONUS: Hannah Horvath
       Without any of the redeeming qualities the four founders prized
       Hannah would break the sorting hat. She would then be banished to
       the dark forest, where she'd write a book about the experience.
