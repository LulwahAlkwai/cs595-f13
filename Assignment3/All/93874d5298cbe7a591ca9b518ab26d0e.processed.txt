Reference Modules: Changing the Way We Do Research

   By: [49]Michelle McMahon, Posted on: September 16, 2013
   [50]Comments: 0

   [51]Chemistry, Molecular sciences and Engineering Module on
   ScienceDirect Scientific and technological research is becoming
   increasingly interdisciplinary, placing higher demands on researchers
   to get up to speed quickly on topics outside of their expertise.
   Researchers typically rely on reference works for such foundational
   content, yet publishers are challenged to provide that content in a way
   that fulfills the real needs those researchers have for currency.

   [52]Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences Module on ScienceDirect

   The key challenge is that traditional reference works are published
   every few years and their content can be very out-of-date.

   Other common starting points for research are traditional search
   engines or online wikis, though each has its limitations. Search
   engines compile relevant and irrelevant results, making it hard to find
   the useful content. Online wikis lack rigorous review from
   subject-matter experts and are often not trustworthy or cited.

   To address this need, Elsevier employees aimed to merge the reliability
   of traditional reference works with the regular updates an online
   solution could offer. They developed [53]Elsevier Reference Modules on
   ScienceDirect, which combine thousands of related reference-work
   articles into a single source of information that is continuously
   updated by experts. They unlock foundational content that has yet to be
   updated in print, giving researchers access to updated reference
   content as science progresses.

   The first modules available to researchers are [54]Chemistry, Molecular
   Sciences and Chemical Engineering and [55]Earth Systems and
   Environmental Sciences.

   Reference Modules, which [56]launched today, organize reference
   articles from across interdisciplinary scientific fields. The modules
   feature advanced search and browse tools. They are designed to be a
   trustworthy, citable reference that quickly gets researchers up to
   speed and connects them to more advanced content.

   IFRAME: [57]//www.youtube.com/embed/Z60Gk8E2IzI

   Most researchers are under increasing pressure to win funding and
   obtain valuable research outcomes in shorter amounts of time. And as
   research becomes more interdisciplinary, they must explore topics
   outside their areas of expertise.

   Elsevier Reference Module at a glance

   [58]Ref Mods at a glance box "I am being asked to stretch myself
   further and wider into fields that are not my immediate expertise,"
   said [59]Dr. Kate Lajtha, Reference Modules Subject Editor and Director
   of the [60]Environmental Sciences Program at Oregon State University.
   "(With Reference Modules), I can read a general overview of a new area,
   and then follow trails into more and more specific chapters as my
   research demands."

   The reference work articles are kept current by experts as science
   progresses. To show researchers just how current they are, there is a
   time stamp on each article indicating the date of last review or
   update. In the past, updated reference work content would have been
   unavailable to researchers until the typical five-to-seven year
   publishing cycle was complete.

   Learning from users
   [61]Cory Polonetsky

   Cory Polonetsky

   [62]Cory Polonetsky, head of marketing for the launch of Reference
   Modules, spent three days last week with dozens of chemists discussing
   their research needs at the [63]American Chemical Society's
   exposition in Indianapolis.

   Polonetsky noted some of the key challenges faced by researchers,
   including the chemists he met at the exposition: "Many struggle to
   determine whether an article they find is still `good science,' " he
   said. "Others worry that the content they purchase will be quickly out
   of date."

   He learned that those who teach often cringe when their students use
   online wikis for research, sacrificing expert review for ease of use.
   "Researchers want a trustworthy reference work that is comprehensive
   but easy to use and never gets old," he said.

   Several chemists at the conference told Polonetsky that Reference
   Modules will solve these problems. He thought Reference Modules were
   well-received at the exposition because "researchers value solutions
   that save time, can be cited, lead to significant research outcomes
   and help them secure funding."

   A sea change in publishing

   To publish this new type of foundational content, the team at Elsevier
   was required to completely change their approach.
   [64]Lisa Tickner

   Lisa Tickner

   "It's a massive change," said [65]Lisa Tickner, Director for Continuity
   Publishing at Elsevier. "We're leading the way in a new approach to
   publishing book content. We've been publishing electronic reference
   works for a while now, but it's still been the case that you publish an
   e-book, wait a few years and then do another edition."

   She said this is Elsevier's "first foray into modular publishing and
   continuous updating" and it took a lot of hard work and creative
   problem solving by many teams within Elsevier to bring Reference
   Modules to market.

   To make Reference Modules a continuously-updated product on
   the [66]ScienceDirect platform, they needed a completely different
   workflow than the one used to develop traditional reference books. This
   change presented new technical and production challenges.

   The platform team had to figure out the right presentation of content
   and navigation on ScienceDirect, a full-text scientific database of
   more than 11 million journal articles and book chapters. There was also
   the challenge of changing the production workflow to handle
   continuously updating content at a rapid pace.

   Meanwhile, the Continuity Publishing editorial team - the group that
   oversees the content in Elsevier reference works - completely revised
   the way they create, review and publish foundational content.

   Trustworthy

   To ensure the content in Reference Modules is trustworthy, they built
   editorial boards - teams of accomplished subject-matter experts - to
   select, organize and the review the content in each of the modules.
   There is an editorial board for each of the Reference Modules led by
   well-respected researchers:

   [67]Jan Reedijk, PhD

   [68]Scott A. Elias, PhD

   [69]Dr. Jan Reedijk, Emeritus Professor at [70]Leiden University in the
   Netherlands, is Editor-in-Chief for Chemistry, Molecular Sciences and
   Chemical Engineering.

   [71]Dr. Scott Elias, Professor of Quaternary Science at [72]Royal
   Holloway, University of London, is Editor-in-Chief for Earth Systems
   and Environmental Sciences.

   These editorial boards organized content from Elsevier reference works
   into intuitive, interdisciplinary subject hierarchies. Once the content
   was sorted into these hierarchies, the editorial boards reviewed all
   the content for currency. The articles were either confirmed to be
   current, updated, or removed and replaced. This is the time stamping
   process, which assures researchers that they are using the most current
   information to inform their research.

   With the first Reference Modules available, the editorial and
   production teams can take a breather - but not for long. Reference
   Modules are "living products," as Tickner noted, and the work is never
   truly finished. The work of continuous updating goes on for the first
   two modules, while the team prepares to build new modules in the coming
   year.
