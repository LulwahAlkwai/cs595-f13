   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   NSA shares raw intelligence including Americans' data with Israel. We
   are so totally screwed.
   Boy these disclosures get better and better, apparently not only does
   the NSA spy on Americans (you may recall they testified they didn't)
   but they share the raw data, not the data associated with known or
   suspected terrorists, with Israel. At some point it all stops being
   very funny and really becomes a concern because you begin to wonder who
   else gets this data (Eastern European criminal organizations for
   instance?). Maybe their acronym should be changed to remove the word
   "security" as that now seems totally inappropriate and dishonest. Story
   from the Guardian today:
