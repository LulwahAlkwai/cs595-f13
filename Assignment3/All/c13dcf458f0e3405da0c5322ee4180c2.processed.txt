Resharing Differences Between LinkedIn and Radar

   by [18]Tim O'Reilly | [19]@timoreilly | [20]+Tim O'Reilly |
   [21]Comments: 4 | September 18, 2013

   I recently posted a long thought piece entitled "How I Failed" [22]on
   LinkedIn, and then a few days later, [23]republished it here on my own
   Radar blog. (I published it on LinkedIn first because I wanted to reach
   the more business-oriented audience on LinkedIn, and not just the
   technical audience that we reach here with Radar.)

   This morning, I decided to check on the resharing stats that are
   published at the top of  posts on both LinkedIn and here on Radar (a
   WordPress based blog).  I normally look at these stats to see the
   relative impact of Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn on the
   readership of my posts.  But this time, I realized I had another data
   point available - the differences in the use of these services by my
   Radar readers and my LinkedIn readers.

   When I compared the stats this morning, a couple of things surprised
   me.

   As you can see, there was a lot more Twitter activity resulting from
   the Radar post than from the LinkedIn post, and as expected, a lot more
   LinkedIn resharing on LinkedIn itself. That wasn't surprising (although
   I suspect the amount of engagement LinkedIn has achieved through its
   Influencer program is a surprise to many people.)

   As is usually the case for my posts, I find that Twitter tops Facebook
   and Google+ for resharing, and that Google+ is a significant fraction
   of both Twitter and Facebook - showing far more engagement than many
   critics allow. That is interesting, but wasn't surprising either.

   But what did surprise me a bit is that the share count is identical for
   both Google+ and Facebook. They both seem to have detected that the two
   posts were the same, despite the different URLs. Twitter and LinkedIn
   did not.  I expected that of Google. I didn't expect it of Facebook.

       Data intelligence from Facebook surprises you? (Thanks for sharing,
       I love picking through user data.)

       If Google and Facebook have this knowledge, wouldn't it be great if
       they could also centralize the discussion in the comments?

       View source on the post on oreilly.com shows the answer. Both
       Facebook and Google+ must be looking at rel=canonical to tie the
       two together.

            Right. But notice that Twitter and LinkedIn are ignoring this
            attribute. I expected Google to pay attention. I thought FB
            would be like Twitter and LinkedIn. At any rate, good for
            them.
