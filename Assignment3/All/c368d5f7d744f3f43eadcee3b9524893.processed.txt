   Roomba vs. Neato: Robots Battle To Clean My Home. The Neato is SOOOO
   much smarter and needs to be.
   I have a Roomba house and I think I have every robot sweeper they have
   and even the unfortunate mopping product (which really doesn't work
   well). Recently I got in the updated Neato product and it is so much
   smarter and better largely because it really is a vacuum and it uses
   technology similar to Google's self-driving car. Kind of the difference
   between having a professional vacuum your home vs. the village idiot.
   The first will leave nice lines on your carpet the second not so much.
   That is the focus of my Digital Trends column this week.
