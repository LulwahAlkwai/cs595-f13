[120]Scientists transform scar tissue into beating heart muscle

   by Ed Yong

   In an act of transformation worthy of any magician, scientists have
   converted scar tissue in the hearts of living mice into beating heart
   cells. If the same trick works in humans (and we're still several years
   away from a trial), it could lead us to a long-sought prize of medicine
   - a way to mend a broken heart.

   Our hearts are made of several different types of cell. These include
   muscle cells called [121]cardiomyocytes, which contract together to
   give hearts their beats, and connective cells called cardiac
   fibroblasts, which provide support. The fibroblasts make up half of a
   heart, but they become even more common after a heart attack. If hearts
   are injured, they replace lost cardiomyocytes with scar tissue,
   consisting of fibroblasts. In the short-term, this provides support for
   damaged tissue. In the long-term, it weakens the heart and increases
   the risk of even further problems.

   Hearts can't reverse this scarring. Despite their vital nature, they
   are terrible at healing themselves. But [122]Deepak Srivastava from the
   Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease can persuade them to do
   so with the right chemical cocktail. In 2010, he showed that [123]just
   three genes - Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (or GMT)- could transform
   fibroblasts into new cardiomyocytes.

   This only worked in cells growing in a laboratory dish, but it was a
   start. Srivastava's team have now taken the next step. By injecting
   living mice with GMT, they turned some of the rodents' fibroblasts into
   cardiomyocytes. Since hearts are already loaded with fibroblasts,
   Srivastava's technique simply conscripts them into muscle duty. Best of
   all, the technique worked even better in the animals than in isolated
   cells. No transplants. No surgeries. No stem cells. Just add three
   genes, and watch sick hearts turn into healthier ones.

   "This is a permanent fix," says [124]Benoit Bruneau, a heart specialist
   who works at the same institute but was not involved in this study.
   "The net result is a much smaller scar and restored cardiac function.
   Honestly, I would have thought a few years ago that this was science
   fiction."

   The new work was carried out by Li Qian, a postdoc in Srivastava's
   team. She used viruses to smuggle GMT into mouse hearts. The viruses
   home in on cells that are actively dividing, so they shun
   cardiomyocytes in favour of fibroblasts. Once there, they delivered
   their genetic payload, and the infected fibroblasts transformed into
   heart muscle.

   Qian proved this by working with a special strain of mice, where any
   cell that switched on a fibroblast-specific gene would give off a red
   glow. After delivering the GMT-loaded viruses, Qian found that many
   cardiomyocytes glowed red. They looked like heart muscle. They formed
   bundles like hear t muscle. They switched on the same genes that heart
   muscle does. But they had clearly once been fibroblasts.

   The viruses were just as efficient at reprogramming cells in a mouse as
   cells in a dish. In both cases, they converted around 10 to 15 per cent
   of the fibroblasts they infected. But the transformation was more
   complete in the animals, and the newly anointed muscle cells were a
   closer match for the real thing. They stuck to one another and to
   existing cardiomyocytes, and they beat in unison.

   Best of all, the team found that the GMT trinity could heal mice that
   had recently suffered a heart attack. A couple of months after the
   injections, their hearts had started to recover. They pumped more blood
   and the amount of scar tissue had halved.

   Other teams have tried to create cardiomyocytes in a dish, either
   directly from stem cells or by first reprogramming fibroblasts back
   into a stem-like state. The muscle cells could then be transplanted
   back into a scarred heart. This hasn't worked very well. "The injected
   cells don't help, die off, or don't contract synchronously," explains
   Bruneau. "This new paper circumvents all these issues." And Srivastava
   adds, "The reprogrammed cells never go through a stem cell state, so
   the potential concerns of tumor formation with stem cells will be much
   lower.

   The critical step is creating the new muscle cells within the natural
   environment of the heart. As they develop, they get chemical signals
   from other cells, and mechanical forces from contracting neighbours and
   flowing blood. These inputs are missing from plastic dishes, but
   they're part of what makes a heart a heart. They could mean the
   difference between getting a useless pile of cardiomyocytes and a piece
   of useful beating heart.

   Srivastava is now testing the approach in pigs, whose hearts are
   similar to ours in size and physiology. Those trials will take around
   1.5 years, and Srivastava particularly wants to see if the technique is
   effective and safe. "We will be looking closely for the presence of
   rhythm disorders, although we have not seen that in mice," he says. If
   all goes well, he will begin planning for a human clinical trial.
   Bruneau says, "If this works in larger hearts, this could be the
   approach that helps regenerate human heart tissue after a heart
   attack."
