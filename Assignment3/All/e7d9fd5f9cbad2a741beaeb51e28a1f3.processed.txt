   The Costa Concordia is seen after it was lifted upright on the Tuscan
   Island of Giglio, Italy, early Tuesday morning, Sept. 17, 2013. The
   crippled cruise ship was pulled completely upright early Tuesday after
   a complicated, 19-hour operation to wrench it from its side where it
   capsized last year off Tuscany, with officials declaring it a "perfect"
   end to a daring and unprecedented engineering feat.

   The crippled Costa Concordia cruise ship was pulled completely upright
   early Tuesday after a complicated, 19-hour operation to wrench it from
   its side where it capsized last year off Tuscany, with officials
   declaring it a "perfect" end to a daring and unprecedented engineering
   feat.

   Shortly after 4 a.m., a foghorn wailed on Giglio Island and the head of
   Italy's Civil Protection agency, Franco Gabrielli, announced that the
   ship had reached vertical and that the operation to rotate it - known
   in nautical terms as parbuckling - was complete.

   "We completed the parbuckling operation a few minutes ago the way we
   thought it would happen and the way we hoped it would happen," said
   Franco Porcellacchia, project manager for the Concordia's owner, Costa
   Crociere SpA.

   "A perfect operation, I must say" with no environmental spill detected
   so far, he said.

   Applause rang out among firefighters in the tent where Gabrielli and
   other project engineers made the announcement.

   The Concordia rammed into a reef of Giglio Island on Jan. 13, 2012,
   after the captain brought it too close to shore. It drifted, listed and
   capsized just off the island's port, killing 32 people. Two bodies were
   never recovered.

   The operation to right it had been expected to take no more than 12
   hours, but dragged on after some initial delays with the vast system of
   steel cables, pulleys and counterweights. As evening approached, work
   was clearly falling behind schedule. Hours after the rotation attempt
   began, the Concordia had moved upward only by a total of 10 degrees.

   But the final phase of the rotation went remarkably fast as gravity
   began to kick in and pull the ship toward its normal position.

   Parbuckling is a standard operation to right capsized ships. But never
   before has such an enormous cruise ship been righted, and the crippled
   Concordia didn't budge for the first three hours after the operation
   began, engineer Sergio Girotto told reporters.

   After some 6,000 tons of force were applied though -- using a complex
   system of pulleys and counterweights -- Girotto said "we saw the
   detachment" from the reef thanks to undersea cameras.

   The ship is expected to be floated away from Giglio in the spring and
   turned into scrap.

   Porcellacchia said an initial inspection of the starboard side, covered
   in brown slime from its 20 months underwater while the ship was stuck
   on a rocky seabed perch, "looks pretty bad."

   That is the side of the hull that was raised 65 degrees in the
   operation. Crews might have to do extensive work on that side to ready
   it for the attachment of empty tanks that will later be used to help
   float the vessel away. It must also be made strong enough to survive a
   second winter storm season, when high seas and gusts will likely buffet
   the 115,000-ton, 300-meter long liner.

   Helping the Concordia to weather the winter is an artificial platform
   on the seabed that was constructed to support the ship's flat keel.

   "The ship is resting on its platform," Gabrielli said.

   About an hour before the rotation was complete, observers said the boat
   seemed to suddenly settle down upon its new perch.

   The Concordia's captain is on trial for alleged manslaughter, causing a
   shipwreck and abandoning the ship during the chaotic and delayed
   evacuation. Capt. Francesco Schettino claims the reef wasn't on the
   nautical charts for the liner's weeklong Mediterranean cruise.
