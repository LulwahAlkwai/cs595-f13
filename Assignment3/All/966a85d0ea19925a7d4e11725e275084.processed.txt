   This article is about leverage points related to System Dynamics. For
   other uses, see [19]Center of gravity (military).

   The twelve leverage points to intervene in a system were proposed by
   [20]Donella Meadows, a scientist and system analyst focused on
   environmental limits to economic growth. The leverage points, first
   published in 1997, were inspired by her attendance at a [21]North
   American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) meeting in the early 1990s where
   she realized that a very large new system was being proposed but the
   mechanisms to manage it were ineffective.

   Meadows, who worked in the field of [22]systems analysis, proposed a
   scale of places to intervene in a [23]system. Awareness and
   manipulation of these levers is an aspect of [24]self-organization and
   can lead to [25]collective intelligence.

   Her observations are often cited in [26]energy economics, [27]green
   economics and [28]human development theory.

   She started with the observation that there are levers, or places
   within a [29]complex system (such as a firm, a city, an economy, a
   living being, an [30]ecosystem, an [31]ecoregion) where a "small shift
   in one thing can produce big changes in everything" (compare:
   constraint in the sense of [32]Theory of Constraints).

   She claimed we need to know about these shifts, where they are and how
   to use them. She said most people know where these points are
   instinctively, but tend to adjust them in the wrong direction. This
   understanding would help solve global problems such as
   [33]unemployment, [34]hunger, [35]economic stagnation, [36]pollution,
   [37]resources depletion, and [38]conservation issues.

   Meadows started with a 9-point list of such places, and expanded it to
   a list of twelve leverage points with explanation and examples, for
   systems in general.

   She describes a [39]system as being in a certain state, and containing
   a [40]stock, with inflows (amounts coming into the system) and outflows
   (amounts going out of the system). At a given time, the system is in a
   certain perceived state. There may also be a [41]goal for the system to
   be in a certain state. The difference between the current state and the
   goal is the discrepancy.

   For example, one might consider a [42]lake or reservoir, which contains
   a certain amount of water. The inflows are the amount of water coming
   from rivers, rainfall, drainage from nearby soils, and waste water from
   a local industrial plant. The outflows might be the amount of water
   used up for irrigation of nearby cornfield, water taken by that local
   plant to operate as well as the local camping site, water
   [43]evaporating in the [44]atmosphere, and trickling surplus water when
   the reservoir is full.

   Local inhabitants complain about the water level getting low, pollution
   getting higher, and the potential effect of hot water release in the
   lake on life (in particular, the fish).
   This is the difference between the perceived state (pollution or low
   water level) and the goal (a non-polluted lake).

Leverage points to intervene in a system[45]Edit

   The following are in increasing order of effectiveness.

12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes,
standards)[46]Edit

   Parameters are points of lowest leverage effects. Though they are the
   most clearly perceived among all leverages, they rarely change
   behaviors and therefore have little long-term effect.

   For example, climate parameters may not be changed easily (the amount
   of rain, the [47]evapotranspiration rate, the temperature of the
   water), but they are the ones people think of first (they remember that
   in their youth, it was certainly raining more). These parameters are
   indeed very important. But even if changed (improvement of upper river
   stream to canalize incoming water), they will not change behavior much
   (the debit will probably not dramatically decrease).

11. The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their
flows[48]Edit

   A [49]buffer's ability to stabilize a system is important when the
   stock amount is much higher than the potential amount of inflows or
   outflows. In the lake, the water is the buffer: if there's a lot more
   of it than inflow/outflow, the system stays stable.

   For example, the inhabitants are worried the lake fish might die as a
   consequence of hot water release directly in the lake without any
   previous cooling off. However, the water in the lake has a large
   [50]heat capacity, so it's a strong thermic buffer. Provided the
   release is done at low enough depth, under the [51]thermocline, and the
   lake volume is big enough, the buffering capacity of the water might
   prevent any extinction from excess temperature.

   Buffers can improve a system, but they are often physical entities
   whose size is critical and can't be changed easily.

10. Structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport network,
population age structures)[52]Edit

   A system's structure may have enormous effect on operations, but may be
   difficult or prohibitively expensive to change. Fluctuations,
   limitations, and bottlenecks may be easier to address.

   For example, the inhabitants are worried about their lake getting
   polluted, as the industry releases chemical pollutants directly in the
   water without any previous treatment. The system might need the used
   water to be diverted to a [53]wastewater treatment plant, but this
   requires rebuilding the underground used water system (which could be
   quite expensive).

9. Length of delays, relative to the rate of system changes[54]Edit

   Information received too quickly or too late can cause over- or
   underreaction, even oscillations.

   For example, the city council is considering building the wastewater
   treatment plant. However, the plant will take 5 years to be built, and
   will last about 30 years. The first delay will prevent the water being
   cleaned up within the first 5 years, while the second delay will make
   it impossible to build a plant with exactly the right capacity.

8. Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are
trying to correct against[55]Edit

   A [56]negative feedback loop slows down a process, tending to promote
   stability. The loop will keep the stock near the goal, thanks to
   parameters, accuracy and speed of information feedback, and size of
   correcting flows.

   For example, one way to avoid the lake getting more and more polluted
   might be through setting up an additional levy on the industrial plant
   based on measured concentrations of its effluent. Say the plant
   management has to pay into a water management fund, on a weekly or
   monthly basis, depending on the actual amount of waste found in the
   lake; they will, in this case, receive a direct benefit not just from
   reducing their waste output, but actually reducing it enough to achieve
   the desired effect of reducing concentrations in the lake. They cannot
   benefit from "doing damage more slowly" -- only from actually helping.
   If cutting emissions, even to zero, is insufficient to allow the lake
   to naturally purge the waste, then they will still be on the hook for
   cleanup. This is similar to the US "Superfund" system, and follows the
   widely accepted "polluter pays principle".

7. Gain around driving positive feedback loops[57]Edit

   A [58]positive feedback loop speeds up a process. Meadows indicates
   that in most cases, it is preferable to slow down a positive loop,
   rather than speeding up a negative one.

   The [59]eutrophication of a lake is a typical feedback loop that goes
   wild. In a eutrophic lake (which means well-nourished), lots of life
   can be supported (fish included).

   An increase of [60]nutrients will lead to an increase of productivity,
   growth of [61]phytoplankton first, using up as much nutrients as
   possible, followed by growth of [62]zooplankton, feeding up on the
   first ones, and increase of fish populations. The more available
   nutrients there are, the more productivity is increased. As plankton
   organisms die, they fall to the bottom of the lake, where their matter
   is degraded by decomposers.
   However, this degradation uses up available [63]oxygen, and in the
   presence of huge amounts of organic matter to degrade, the medium
   progressively becomes [64]anoxic (there is no more oxygen available).
   In time, all oxygen-dependent life dies, and the lake becomes a smelly
   anoxic place where no life can be supported (in particular no fish).

6. Structure of information flow (who does and does not have access to what
kinds of information)[65]Edit

   [66]Information flow is neither a parameter, nor a reinforcing or
   slowing loop, but a loop that delivers new information. It is cheaper
   and easier to change information flows than it is to change structure.

          For example, a monthly public report of water pollution level,
          especially nearby the industrial release, could have a lot of
          effect on people's opinions regarding the industry, and lead to
          changes in the waste water level of pollution.

5. Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints)[67]Edit

   Pay attention to rules, and to who makes them.

   For example, a strengthening of the law related to chemicals release
   limits, or an increase of the tax amount for any water containing a
   given pollutant, will have a very strong effect on the lake water
   quality.

4. Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure[68]Edit

   [69]Self-organization describes a system's ability to change itself by
   creating new structures, adding new negative and positive feedback
   loops, promoting new information flows, or making new rules.

   For example, microorganisms have the ability to not only change to fit
   their new polluted environment, but also to undergo an evolution that
   makes them able to biodegrade or bioaccumulate chemical pollutants.
   This capacity of part of the system to participate in its own
   [70]eco-evolution is a major leverage for change.

3. Goal of the system[71]Edit

   Changing goals changes every item listed above: parameters, feedback
   loops, information and self-organization.

   A city council decision might be to change the goal of the lake from
   making it a free facility for public and private use, to a more
   [72]tourist oriented facility or a [73]conservation area. That goal
   change will effect several of the above leverage points: information on
   water quality will become mandatory and legal punishment will be set
   for any illegal effluent.

2. Mindset or paradigm that the system -- its goals, structure, rules,
delays, parameters -- arises from[74]Edit

   A societal paradigm is an idea, a shared unstated assumption, or a
   system of thought that is the foundation of complex social structures.
   Paradigms are very hard to change, but there are no limits to paradigm
   change. Meadows indicates paradigms might be changed by repeatedly and
   consistently pointing out anomalies and failures in the current
   paradigm to those with open minds.

          A current paradigm is "Nature is a stock of resources to be
          converted to human purpose". What might happen to the lake were
          this collective idea changed ?

1. Power to transcend paradigms[75]Edit

   Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental
   assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that
   lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at
   will.

   Many today see Nature as a stock of resources to be converted to human
   purpose. Many Native Americans see Nature as a living god, to be loved,
   worshipped, and lived with. These views are incompatible, but perhaps
   another viewpoint could incorporate them both, along with others.
