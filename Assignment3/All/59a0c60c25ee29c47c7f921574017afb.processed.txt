Similarities Between Rolf Dobelli's Book and Ours

   [6]Rolf Dobelli, a Swiss writer, published a book called The Art of
   Thinking Clearly earlier this year with HarperCollins in the U.S. The
   book's original German edition was a #1 bestseller, and the book has
   sold over one million copies worldwide.
   In perusing Mr. Dobelli's book, we noticed several familiar-sounding
   passages. On closer examination, we found five instances of
   unattributed material that is either reproduced verbatim or closely
   paraphrased from text and arguments in our book, [7]The Invisible
   Gorilla (Crown, 2010). They are listed at the end of this note.
   [8]Nassim Taleb (author of The Black Swan and other books) has also
   [9]publicly noted similarities between his work and material in Mr.
   Dobelli's book. We have also become aware of a similarity between
   material in Being Wrong by [10]Kathryn Schulz and material in Mr.
   Dobelli's book.
   We sent a letter to Mr. Dobelli and his publishers noting our concern
   about these five passages. Mr. Dobelli replied to us privately and
   posted the following text on his website (since removed):

     "I received two letters claiming inadequate attributions or
     citations in the book 'The Art of Thinking Clearly.' Some of the
     claims are true, some false. For the ones that are true, I take full
     responsibility. I will work closely with the publishers of my book
     that the corrections are put in effect as quickly as possible."

   In the interest of transparency, we have decided to post the list of
   similar passages here. We understand that Mr. Dobelli will be
   identifying the changes he intends to make to his book [11]on his
   website as well.
   -- Christopher Chabris & Daniel Simons
   Passages with overlap between The Invisible Gorilla by Christopher
   Chabris and Daniel Simons, and The Art of Thinking Clearly by Rolf
   Dobelli (portions of greatest similarity between the books are
   highlighted in red):
   1.   Chabris/Simons: In April 2006, rising waters made a ford through
   the start of the Avon River temporarily impassable, so it was closed
   and markers were put on both sides. Every day during the two weeks
   following the closure, one or two cars drove right past the warning
   signs and into the river. These drivers apparently were so focused on
   their navigation displays that they didn't see what was right in front
   of them. [pp. 41-42]
   Dobelli: After heavy rains in the south of England, a river in a small
   village overflowed its banks. The police closed the ford, the shallow
   part of the river where vehicles cross, and diverted traffic. The
   crossing stayed closed for two weeks, but each day at least one car
   drove past the warning sign and into the rushing water. The drivers
   were so focused on their car's navigation systems that they didn't
   notice what was right in front of them. [p. 263; opening paragraph of
   Chapter 88]
   2.   Chabris/Simons: The "Nun Bun" was a cinnamon pastry whose twisty
   rolls eerily resembled the nose and jowls of Mother Teresa. It was
   found in a Nashville coffee shop in 1996, but was stolen on Christmas
   in 2005. [p. 155]
   Dobelli: The "Nun Bun" was a cinnamon pastry whose markings resembled
   the nose and jowls of Mother Teresa. It was found in a Nashville coffee
   shop in 1996 but was stolen on Christmas in 2005. [p. 310]
   3.   Chabris/Simons: "Our Lady of the Underpass" was another appearance
   by the Virgin Mary, this time in the guise of a salt stain under
   Interstate 94 in Chicago that drew huge crowds and stopped traffic for
   months in 2005. Other cases include Hot Chocolate Jesus, Jesus on a
   shrimp tail dinner, Jesus in a dental x-ray, and Cheesus (a Cheeto
   purportedly shaped like Jesus). [p. 155]
         Dobelli: "Our Lady of the Underpass" was another appearance by
   the Virgin Mary, this time as a salt stain under Interstate 94 in
   Chicago in 2005. Other cases include Hot Chocolate Jesus, Jesus on a
   shrimp tail dinner, Jesus in a dental X-ray, and a Cheeto shaped like
   Jesus. [p. 310]
   4.   Chabris/Simons: In other words, almost immediately after you see
   an object that looks anything like a face, your brain treats it like a
   face and processes it differently than other objects. [p. 156]
         Dobelli: As soon as an object looks like a face, the brain treats
   it like a face--this is very different from other objects. [p. 310]
   5.   The paragraph in Dobelli is a condensation and paraphrase of a
   longer passage and argument appearing in The Invisible Gorilla:
         Chabris/Simons: It may come as a surprise, then, to learn that
   talking to a passenger in your car is not nearly as disruptive as
   talking on a cell phone. In fact, most of the evidence suggests that
   talking to a passenger has little or no effect on driving ability.^40
               Talking to a passenger could be less problematic for
   several reasons. First, it's simply easier to hear and understand
   someone right next to you than someone on a phone, so you don't need to
   exert as much effort just to keep up with the conversation. Second, the
   person sitting next to you provides another set of eyes--a passenger
   might notice something unexpected on the road and alert you, a service
   your cell-phone conversation partner can't provide. The most
   interesting reason for this difference between cell-phone conversation
   partners and passengers has to do with the social demands of
   conversations. When you converse with the other people in your car,
   they are aware of the environment you are in. Consequently, if you
   enter a challenging driving situation and stop speaking, your
   passengers will quickly deduce the reason for your silence. There's no
   social demand for you to keep speaking because the driving context
   adjusts the expectations of everyone in the car about social
   interaction. When talking on a cell phone, though, you feel a strong
   social demand to continue the conversation despite difficult driving
   conditions because your conversation partner has no reason to expect
   you to suddenly stop and start speaking. These three factors, in
   combination, help to explain why talking on a cell phone is
   particularly dangerous when driving, more so than many other forms of
   distraction. [p. 26]
         Dobelli: And, if instead of phoning someone, you chat with
   whomever is in the passenger seat? Research found no negative effects.
   First, face-to-face conversations are much clearer than phone
   conversations, that is, your brain must not work so hard to decipher
   the messages. Second, your passenger understands that if the situation
   gets dangerous, the chatting will be interrupted. That means you do not
   feel compelled to continue the conversation. Third, your passenger has
   an additional pair of eyes and can point out dangers. [pp. 353-354]

       I haven't read any of the books, but this seems to be a growing
       problem in many different areas, including what you might call
       'primary science", that is the acquisition of new knowledge of the
       natural world.
       If you haven't already done it, run the entire book through a
       plagiarism check tool.
       Corrections are an interesting point. One has to ask why were the
       examples plagiarised. Is the book derivative in an intellectual
       sense, so requires similar exemplars to argue for the same thesis
       or antithesis? Fairly classic that publishers resort to the
       minimum, they are happy counting the cash and couldn't care less
       how it is acquired.
       Resorting to lawyers probably too expensive and also time
       consuming, but you could build up the evidence and then use the
       'crowd' to build a momentum of opinion.

       Hmm. Seems to me, theft is theft. What other evidence could be
       required?

       Doesn't the phone-in-car example come from Daniel Kahneman? I could
       be wrong but I don't think it's an original idea.

            No -- our book was published before his, and we didn't get the
            idea, or the three-point argument, from anything he had
            written.
