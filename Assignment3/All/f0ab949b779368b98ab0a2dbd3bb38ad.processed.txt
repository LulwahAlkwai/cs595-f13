12 Jun 2013: Bird-Mimicking Mobile Apps
Harmful to Species, UK Groups Say

   Wildlife officials in the UK are urging people not to use mobile phone
   apps that mimic bird songs in nature reserves, warning that the devices
   [3]can harm some sensitive species, particularly during breeding
   season. The increasingly popular apps, which use recordings of bird
   calls to lure the birds closer for

   iSpiny
   Icon for Chirp! app
   photographs or better viewing, can distract birds from critical tasks,
   such as feeding their young, according to the Royal Society for the
   Protection of Birds. The Dorset Wildlife Trust (DWT), a conservation
   group that oversees 42 reserves, [4]is discouraging the use of the
   mobile apps at its reserves, calling it an intentional disturbance of
   sensitive species such as the Nightjar, a nocturnal bird that has
   experienced a recent recovery in the area. "I'm sure visitors would be
   devastated if they realized the possible disturbance they were causing
   to wildlife," said Chris Thain, a manager at the DWT's Brownsea Island
   reserve. Hilary Wilson, a biologist who helped develop the Chirp! app
   for the UK-based developer [5]iSpiny, told the BBC that the technology
   is meant to be an educational tool, but agreed that the sounds could
   have a powerful effect on birds. "Out of consideration for both the
   birds and fellow birdwatchers, just keep the volume low," she said.
