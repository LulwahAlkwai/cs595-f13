The Garage Series: 365 Days Later - Office 365 vs. Office 2013 on the Desktop
Review

   by [63]Jeremy Chapman
   on September 18

   This week Jeremy Chapman and Tal Krzypow return to the Garage in
   Microsoft's Redmond campus to kick off season two. They try to answer
   common questions, "Which version of Office should I buy?" and "Are the
   Office apps in Office 365 the 'full' Office?" while recapping the
   events and new client side features of the last four seasons. And if
   you've ever wondered what some of the main differences are between
   Office generations or whether Click-to-Run deployment can really scale,
   you're in luck as Jeremy explains topics using authentic Flamenco
   dancing from Madrid.

   IFRAME: [64]http://www.youtube.com/embed/h-JEWRBedeQ

   Jeremy: After a sweeping array of shows from New Orleans -- where we
   wrestled alligators to test Office against the Wild, challenged a blues
   bands to real-time co-author a blues song and saved #dealwithit from
   himself through Data Loss Prevention as he took revenge on his boss --
   we are back in the real Office Garage in Redmond -- the hub of Office
   innovation -- to kick off season two of the Garage Series.

   Tal: To start the new season of shows we thought that we would take a
   look at the new Office almost 365 days in market.  A question that we
   get asked a lot is which version of Office to choose on your desktop.
   The Office 2013 single license, single device option, what you may be
   used to as an off-the-shelf boxed product, or the subscription-based
   service with Office 365.

   Jeremy: So the first thing to level-set on is no matter which option
   you choose you get the full version of all your familiar Office
   applications. No matter which option you choose it will run locally off
   your device. The main difference as Tal explains on the show is that
   Office 365 is connected to you as a user which means that you can
   install on multiple devices, up to five,  and your content and files
   will roam with you. Because Office 365 is delivered as a service the
   new features and updates can also be delivered to you more
   dynamically.

   Tal: In fact, to help you better understand the difference between the
   two new Office options we decided to take a look at what difference a
   year makes and evaluate the evolving capabilities distinct to Office
   2013 and Office 365 on the desktop.  We tallied the results and we hope
   this helps you to determine which option is best for you

   Jeremy : The thing that I think will stand out to people is the ongoing
   expansion of Office to your devices of choice from Windows to iOS and
   Android, while retaining the fidelity of your content for a consistent
   user experience. In addition to this there is cross-device support
   across communication and collaboration scenarios. Beyond all of the end
   user things we highlight, there was a lot of work done for the IT pros
   out there. We added several identity tools to make to move into a
   user-based Office world easier, things like Password Hash Sync, DirSync
   Filtering, Office 365 Adapter and my favorite feature, Click-to-Run.

   While we were on location in Madrid, we decided to highlight the
   ability of Office 365 ProPlus to run side-by-side with older versions
   of Office and prove that scaled automated deployments are possible - in
   a race. During the process we also wanted to explain the core
   differences between the generations of Office from Office 2003 to
   Office 365 ProPlus - all set to authentic Flamenco dancing from the
   team at [65]Tablao Las Carboneras and filmed at the beautiful
   [66]Torres Bermejas in Madrid. Special thanks to our Flamenco
   performers - this was truly a unique choreography challenge! Watch the
   show to see how it all turns out.

   Tal: So what's next? We have a fantastic season of shows ahead of us
   that will offer you a deeper dive on how you can take advantage of the
   new capabilities as they become available in the new Office 365 service
   at work, home and play, from cross device usage, advanced collaboration
   scenarios, power user features and the latest in IT administrative
   control. And you won't want to miss our road-trip specials from Hong
   Kong, Washington DC and Dubai where we meet with people and
   organizations deploying Office 365 today and engage in stunts with
   local, international and cultural flair.

   See you then!

   Jeremy and Tal
