[22]Results of the First PeerJ Author Survey

   We recently passed the [23]six month mark for publishing PeerJ
   articles, and so we felt it would be a good time to take stock and
   conduct an Author Feedback Survey to see how we are doing.

   On August 28th, a survey invitation was sent to every corresponding
   author who had received a first decision (of any type - including
   rejections) through August 27th 2013. We had a 51% response rate (132
   respondents) which is very good for a survey of this nature. This group
   obviously included authors who had gone on to be published, and so that
   sub-set of authors answered some additional questions. Most questions
   provided a range of 5 answers and the survey closed on the 3rd
   September.

   The headline finding is that 92% of responding authors rated their
   overall PeerJ experience as either "one of the best publishing
   experiences I have ever had" (42%) or "a good experience" (49%). We are
   terrifically proud of this response and thank those authors for this
   feedback!

   Going further, 83% of authors intend to submit to us again (with 17%
   being a `maybe' which largely depended on whether or not their future
   papers would be in our subject areas) and 94% of authors would
   recommend PeerJ to a colleague - again great responses.

   Of those authors who had been published already, 98% rated their
   production experience as either "extremely good - one of the best I
   have experienced" (57%) or "good" (40%),

   image

   and when we asked them about the functionality of their online article,
   87% rated the functionality as either "extremely functional - one of
   the best I have used" (38%) or "very functional"(49%).

   As to the speed and effectiveness of the editorial process, 86%
   reported that their time to first decision was either "extremely fast"
   (29%) or "fast" (57%). Note: We are currently getting first decisions
   to authors in [24]just 24 days.

   We also encouraged free text feedback, which we will be digesting over
   the coming days and weeks. But from that feedback, here are some great
   quotes from Real Authors:

     "Quick, cheap, open access, good HTML, XML and PDF, archived in all
   the important places, ditto for indexing -- what's not to like?"
     "Fast, modern, innovative, attractive. I especially liked, for the
   first time ever, seeing my name in the copyright statement!"
     "Editor was top notch, helpful, shared his opinions freely and really
   helped to improve our submission"
     "PeerJ is quick, fast, and most importantly, human."
     "The open peer-review was a new and nice experience. Everything was
   fast and smooth. The final product is nice and elegant to the eyes."
     "I love the ease of submission, the transparent review process, the
   open access at affordable price, the speed and quality of the
   peer-review feedback and decision, and the sleek design of the article
   once it has been published."
     "The price, the open access, the open-review policy seem to me the
   way to move science forward."
     "I plan to send essentially all my future work to PeerJ, often
   initially as a preprint. Why? Why wouldn't I? What do other journals
   offer that PeerJ doesn't?"
     "Both in philosophy and in my experience as an author, PeerJ seems to
   be embodying exactly the attitude and approach I believe all scientific
   journals should embrace."
     "I have successfully signed up several colleagues to PeerJ, and will
   continue to do so."
     "Anyone already publishing in or considering PLOS ONE should look at
   PeerJ."

   .

   So, all in all, we received some fantastic feedback from some of our
   earliest authors, and we thank them for taking the time to provide it.
   Of course, there is always room for improvement (we strive for everyone
   to have the best possible experience at PeerJ) but we believe that
   these results significantly out-perform any comparable journal.
