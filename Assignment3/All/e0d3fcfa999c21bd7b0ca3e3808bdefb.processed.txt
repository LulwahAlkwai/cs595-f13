Report: After patent loss, Apple tweaks FaceTime--and logs 500,000 complaints

Apple is doing a "design around" in a case where it already lost $368
million.

   The 2012 patent trial that grabbed the most headlines was Apple's $1
   billion win (since reduced) against Samsung. But Apple also suffered a
   major patent setback of its own last year when a patent-holding company
   called VirnetX won a $368 million [10]verdict against the tech giant.

   The consequences of Apple's loss are now starting to become clear. This
   month, testimony in a court hearing showed that not only is Apple
   facing royalty payments that could cost it many millions more, but it
   has already made changes to one of its premiere products,
   FaceTime--changes that reportedly have degraded the service's quality.

   Apple was found to have infringed four VirnetX patents that cover
   various aspects of the FaceTime video chat system. VirnetX wasn't able
   to get an injunction blocking the use of FaceTime altogether, but the
   judge overseeing the case has been receptive to the argument that Apple
   should pay an ongoing royalty for infringement.

   Now, reports have emerged from a key hearing earlier this month
   indicating that Apple is logging vast numbers of complaints about
   FaceTime after a re-design of the service's backend architecture. It's
   important to note that these reports have emerged mainly from
   discussion groups of VirnetX investors; no media organizations have
   published reports from the royalty hearing, which occurred on August
   15. The documents related to the royalty litigation are almost entirely
   sealed.

   Bearing those caveats in mind, Ars spoke with Jeff Lease, a VirnetX
   investor. Lease runs his own lawn sprinkler installation business and
   owns VirnetX stock, which trades as VHC on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Lease has a clear stake in this dispute; the better VirnetX does in
   court, the better its stock may do. But he has impressively detailed
   knowledge of the case, having shown up both to last year's jury trial
   and post-trial hearings. Lease's statements to me were based off his
   extensive note-taking in court. I have no reason not to believe that
   his statements are accurate, but at this time his statements are the
   only source for this report.

   Neither Apple nor the attorney who represented Apple at the August
   hearing responded to requests for comment. A VirnetX lawyer also did
   not respond to a request for comment.

Apple: We're not infringing, but we re-designed anyhow

   Before the VirnetX case, nearly all FaceTime calls were done through a
   system of direct communication. Essentially, Apple would verify that
   both parties had valid FaceTime accounts and then allow their two
   devices to speak directly to each other over the Internet, without any
   intermediary or "relay" servers. However, a small number of calls--5 to
   10 percent, according to an Apple engineer who testified at trial--were
   routed through "relay servers."

   Both sides in the litigation admit that if Apple routes its FaceTime
   calls through relay servers, it will avoid infringing the VirnetX
   patents. Once Apple was found to be infringing--and realized it could
   end up paying an ongoing royalty for using FaceTime--the company
   redesigned the system so that all FaceTime calls would rely on relay
   servers. Lease believes the switch happened in April.

   "The judge kept telling them, you need to consider yourself
   'adjudicated infringers,'" said Lease. "Apple said, we don't think
   we're infringing, but we switched to 100 percent relay servers
   [anyhow]."

Higher costs and more complaints

   At trial, Apple engineer Patrick Gates testified about how FaceTime
   works. He downplayed the impact that changing the system would have on
   FaceTime quality--presumably to show how unimportant the VirnetX
   patents were. He estimated the cost of running all FaceTime calls
   through relay servers at $3.6 million total. As for call quality, he
   said that it wouldn't be affected negatively at all--if anything, it
   might actually improve.

   But according to Lease, it has now been revealed that Apple is actually
   paying $2.4 million per month to run FaceTime calls through relay
   servers. The payments are mainly to Internet content distribution
   companies like Akamai, which are transmitting vastly more FaceTime
   calls.

   Meanwhile, Apple has handed over its customer service logs from April
   through mid-August to VirnetX's attorneys. At the August 15 hearing, a
   VirnetX lawyer stated that Apple had logged "over half a million calls"
   complaining about the quality of FaceTime, according to Lease.

   If that's accurate, the data will bolster VirnetX's arguments that its
   patents are technologically significant, hard to work around, and
   deserve a high royalty rate. The judge and lawyers present at the
   hearing didn't discuss numbers regarding what a reasonable ongoing
   royalty might be, but VirnetX is asking for royalty payments of more
   than $700 million for the ongoing use of FaceTime, according to Lease.

   In addition to doing a patent design-around with FaceTime, Apple also
   [11]announced back in April that it would be doing a similar
   design-around of its VPN on Demand service for iOS--also to avoid
   VirnetX patents. However, Apple [12]backtracked on those statements a
   few weeks later.

   As to what the judge in the royalty case might do, Lease said there was
   no clear indication in the hearing he observed.

   "He's hard to read," said Lease. "I'd hate to play poker against him."
