SOUND OFF: What is the one word or phrase the business would like NEVER to
hear from IT?

   [22]Posted by Martha Heller on Wed, Jul 11, 2012

   The pen is mightier than the sword, and the fate of nations has been
   altered by a well-written manifesto. Political movements have been
   launched by a single, passionate speech, and marketing departments
   spend millions of dollars coming up with the perfect three words to
   describe their products.

   The fact is, language matters, and as CIO it is one of your most
   powerful tools in bringing IT together with the business. (And it's
   cheap.)

   But before you change the language that your IT organization uses, you
   need to know what's working and what isn't.   If every time you say the
   word "infrastructure" or "cloud" or "agile" or "architecture" you hear
   a collective groan around the steering committee table, you should
   probably find a different word.

   My question to Heller Report readers this week: What is the one word or
   phrase the business would like NEVER to hear from IT? Please tell us
   using the Comments section below.

   The one word the business never wants to hear from IT is "NO".

   SECURITY. To many time over the years security was used as the reason
   (most of the time seen as an excuse) to say no. It is no longer the
   case but the perception lives on. We are working to change the
   perception by offering alternative routes to the business requirement.
   It will take a long time.

   "Non-discretionary" Business partners cringe at the thought of having
   IT budgets and IT delivery capacity consumed by upgrades of aging
   hardware and software at the expense of revenue generating or expense
   reducing projects.

   We have two: "CRM" and "workflow"... as buzzwords they seem to come
   across to managers as indictments, and suggest larger efforts than our
   restructuring business wants to take on. The baby steps we take in each
   are much easier for them to take if we avoid sharing that each step is
   part of the bigger philosophical domain. So we break up the bigger into
   the smaller and conspire in a more adaptive way to produce the
   outcomes.

   There are so many ..... late, complicated, indeterminate, unknown,
   unrealiable, any three-letter-acronym, SPAM, crash, corrupted, lost,
   unrecoverable ..... but my personal favorite: problem.

   In addition to "no" in it's many permutations, there's alway "you'll
   need to open a ticket"
   Posted @ Thursday, July 12, 2012 8:41 AM by Mark Berns
   Calling them "the business".
   Posted @ Thursday, July 12, 2012 9:34 AM by Paul Fipps
   I believe the clear winner will be "NO", and "Yes, but..." should rank
   high on the list, as well.

   "We dont support that!"



   As one (otherwise) very smart executive once told me - I do not
   understand why there is so much delay and fuss with software install
   from your org: - at home I install the DVD and maybe type my name once
   and click the mouse 10 times to set up my PC !!!!!!

   It wasn't in the requirements

   ".... right after ...." Don't let there be that one thing that needs to
   be done before the rest. That and 90%.

   The Blame Game - AKA It wasn't our fault. Open honest communication
   about events and resolutions, and even occasionally falling on ones
   sword, buy soooo much credibility.

   "customer", really I thought we worked together for the same company
   and we both served our customers together.

   "it's on the timeline", who cares, we need it now :)

   "Can't" is the one that comes to mind for me, followed closely by "ROI"
   which is perceived as an artificial barrier to obtaining whatever the
   product or service being discussed.
   Posted @ Friday, July 13, 2012 5:51 AM by Dana Smith
   No would be number one but these days I think sometimes they are
   searching for a "No" so they can execute themselves.
   Posted @ Friday, July 13, 2012 3:03 PM by Ben
   'That's against policy'. Another is 'that will require Steering
   Committee Approval'.





   BTW I loved the 'it wasn't in the requirements' and the 'submit a
   ticket'. Both make me cringe.
   Posted @ Friday, July 13, 2012 3:50 PM by Craig Bickel
   As mentioned by a number of the previous posts: No or Can't.
   Posted @ Friday, July 13, 2012 9:42 PM by [35]Omar Halabieh
   that is a "SOX requirement".....
   Posted @ Wednesday, July 18, 2012 12:09 PM by Ernie Huber
   "You..." - as opposed to "we."
