Stars, and Starlets, of Science

   [19]photo Christmas season in New York has what you would call "high
   production values." The scale and fanfare of the lights and events in
   Manhattan this week remind me of the live finale of Stars of Science I
   attended last month in Doha.

   I went reluctantly. Doha seemed too long a haul from New York for a
   one-night event. But "Stars of Science" Content Producer Leila Creber
   is persistent about the charms of the Arab-world reality television
   show, now entering its fifth season. The series has upwards of 1.5
   million viewers by all estimates, spread throughout the GCC, North
   Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as 358,000 followers on
   Facebook and a growing number-nearly 4000-on Twitter. The four
   finalists of each season's nine-week competition walk away with awards
   totaling $600,000 to develop their technological innovation--no strings
   attached. Previous years' contestants now head their own companies, and
   manufacture products ranging from medical devices to educational media
   to home appliances.There's nothing like this television show in the
   United States or the UK, two places that seem to mint a new reality
   series every week.

   The live finale on an open-air stage at the Qatar Science and
   Technology Park was attended by about 500 people. We sat in over-sized,
   brown velour seats watching dancers scale graphic walls and thrust
   laser spears at one another while drummers with neon-dotted vests
   pounded out a soundtrack between earnest video summaries of the
   finalists projects: a desktop holographic tool, an automated home
   pharmacy, a programmable "smart cooker," and a shared desktop
   projection system. Like most reality shows, it was whacky, even
   kitschy. Unlike most reality television, it was important.

   Despite the fact that the ancient Arab world literally invented
   mathematics, the practice of medicine, astronomy, physics, and numerous
   gadgets for executing and recording those disciplines, most of the
   region's science and technology has lagged in modern times compared
   with that of its western counterparts. The reasons are complex: in some
   places like Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, now Syria, wars have
   permanently distressed and displaced large bands of the population.
   Wars notwithstanding, generations of privileged children have also been
   sent abroad from the Arab region to study at prestigious western
   universities. Many forged new lives away from home.

   In yet other places, long colonial rule by the French or the British
   stymied homegrown innovation. The discovery of massive oil and natural
   gas reserves later dampened the desire or the perceived need for a
   robust culture of invention. In some places, tourist economies were
   seeded and now thrive. In different ways, the region grew into a
   culture of haves and have nots. The ruling rich could buy whatever they
   needed, including the services of all classes of guest workers. They
   could import their food, their cars, their luxury goods, and even their
   science and technology. In large measure, they still do.

   Arab thought leaders understand that the future is not set in oil and
   natural gas. Tourism is not guaranteed. They understand that before the
   petroleum dollars run out, new industries must be conceived and the
   Arab countries must compete and contribute on equal footing at a global
   scale.

   Stars of Science was born of this progressivism. Funded by the Qatar
   Foundation, the education-focused philanthropy headed by the miraculous
   Sheikha Mozah (the second of the Emir's three wives), the show inspires
   young Arabs to believe in themselves and their creative impulses while
   it exposes those young innovators (aged 18-30) to the practical details
   of turning a concept into a business. During their nine weeks on Stars
   of Science, the 16 contestants, whittled down from a pool of 200,
   gleaned after casting calls bringing in many thousands of hopefuls each
   year in a multi-country auditions (the season 5 casting is scheduled in
   nine countries) face four hurdles.

   Proof of Principle, Engineering, Design and Business Plan-these four
   benchmarks determine which contestants will stay and which ones be
   eliminated over the nine-week taping of the show. Each contestant has a
   work space, mentors and a wealth of consulting experts to help develop
   their concept while in residence.

   Naturally, I wanted to know how the women contestants fared. The final
   four last month were all men. But out of three female contestants who
   were part of this season's show, one, Aynour Tatanaki, a 20-year-old of
   Egyptian and Libyan descent, received a special award at the finale to
   develop her Flexible LED Technology. She received a scholarship that
   will send her to Singapore to study with world experts in Flexible LED.
   There, she will develop her programmable walls and floors and other
   interior surfaces--"theme design" for homes, as she calls it, which has
   possibilities beyond the decorative. It could potentially aid the
   visually impaired. This "Stars of Science" award came after theoretical
   physicist and author Michio Kaku gave Tatanaki's project an
   appreciative nod during development in a chance meeting when he came to
   Qatar.

   I'll be following Aynour's journey, even though she wasn't season
   four's winner, when she heads to Singapore in 2013.

   Aynour's story will be important. One of the difficulties of women's
   careers in science and technology is that  mentorship-mentorship that
   tracks and supports the vicissitudes of women's real lives-is hard to
   come by. We've known this for decades as various scholars of science,
   Donna Haraway in particular, have examined the material reality and
   gendered tensions of staying on track in these careers. One of the
   challenges of a reality television show about innovation is that the
   participants, especially those eliminated before the finale, have
   little to no ongoing guidance after the glare of the cameras fades.
   Stars of Science judges acknowledged as much in their press conference
   preceding the finale.

   As we've seen with American shows such as Project Runway, for example,
   non-winning contestants' ideas may be good, or they may have a well of
   other pitches that did not get air time. With Stars of Science, some
   proposals may be good enough to shape the hoped-for technology sectors
   of the region with a bit more development and guidance.

   Between the costumed dancers of the finale and the depth of creativity
   of its contestants, Stars of Science might just be more exciting than
   Santa Con.
