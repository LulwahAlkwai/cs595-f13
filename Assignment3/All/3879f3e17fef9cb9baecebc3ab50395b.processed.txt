   [206]Chris Kraft did it all for NASA. He was the space agency's first
   flight director, overseeing the nation's first human spaceflight, first
   human orbital flight and first spacewalk. He was a senior manager and
   planner during the Apollo program. After the Apollo program he directed
   Johnson Space Center for a decade and oversaw development of the space
   shuttle. Mission Control at Johnson Space Center is named after him.

   In short, Kraft is a legend, and therefore not afraid to speak his
   mind.

   Last week I visited Kraft at his home for a long talk about the state
   of NASA, the agency for which he has devoted his life. He's deeply
   troubled about NASA's future. Among the topics we discuss:
     * Expense and sustainability of the Space Launch System
     * The popularity of NASA's proposed asteroid mission
     * Whether astronauts like flying to the International Space Station
     * Where humans should go in the solar system

   I think it's safe to say these are viewpoints NASA officials aren't
   sharing with President Obama's administration nor the members of
   Congress. But having spoken to a number of current NASA officials and
   even astronauts, many of them will privately express these views as
   well. Here, then, is the interview:

   I know you don't like NASA's approach with the Space Launch System. Why
   is this?

   The necessity of having a big rocket is not justifiable. It's not
   justifiable from a cost point of view, and it's not justifiable from a
   mission plan point of view. It just doesn't make good sense.

   Let's start with cost. I know [207]it's expensive.

   The problem with the SLS is that it's so big that makes it very
   expensive. It's very expensive to design, it's very expensive to
   develop. When they actually start to develop it, the budget is going to
   go haywire. They're going to have all kinds of technical and
   development issues crop up, which will drive the development costs up.
   Then there are the operating costs of that beast, which will eat NASA
   alive if they get there. They're not going to be able to fly it more
   than once a year, if that. Because they don't have the budget to do it.
   So what you've got is a beast of a rocket, that would give you all of
   this capability, which you can't build because you don't have the money
   to build it in the first place, and you can't operate it if you had it.

   What is the alternative?

   In the private sector we've got an Atlas and a Delta rocket, and the
   Europeans have an Ariane rocket. The Russians have lots of rockets
   which are very reliable, and they get reliable by using them. And
   that's something the SLS will never have. Never. Because you can't
   afford to launch it that many times.

   This is the approach by which NASA would save a lot of money by using
   existing rockets, rather than developing its own?

   What's so magic about this being able to lift 120 tons? Why can't you
   use what you've got and put your vehicles into space in pieces, like
   you did with the space station? That's the right way to do it.
   Eventually you'll get to the point where, even with a really big
   rocket, you get to the point where you can't put everything on there
   you need to go where you want to go. Whether you want to go to the moon
   or Mars, you're going to have to do something in Earth orbit, or maybe
   lunar orbit, with an assembly capability, a fuel depot capability and
   the capability to have people operating there sort of as a Cape
   Canaveral in the sky. Everybody that looks into this comes to the same
   conclusion. JSC, if you ask them how to do it, is going to tell you the
   way to do it is with an assembly point in orbit, with fuel depots,
   where you come together and then go.

   In the glory days of NASA you had this huge rocket, the Saturn V. It
   flew astronauts to the surface of the moon seven times. And after that
   NASA could no longer afford it. Are we repeating history?

   Yes. We're heading back to that model, only worse. That's the thing.
   We've got those smarts, we've learned that, we have that institutional
   knowledge, and yet we're ignoring it. It doesn't make sense. We've got
   this tremendous capability to put things into orbit, it already exists,
   and we're not going to use it. Studies all over the country say this is
   the right thing to do. It's a tragedy. It really is.

   You're also not a fan of [209]NASA's plan to lasso an asteroid, bring
   it near the moon, and then send humans to stand upon it. Why?

   Congress is already saying what NASA is doing is wrong. They're saying
   they don't like the asteroid mission. Most in Congress want to see NASA
   go back to the moon. So do nearly all of the scientific and technical
   organizations in the world. China said last week they're going to go to
   the moon. They aren't going just because it's there, it's because it's
   a place where you want to be from all kinds of points of view, from
   science, from a resource point of view. There's no reason why you
   couldn't set up a factory on the moon to build solar panels. You could
   provide enough electrical power on the moon from solar cells, and
   eventually you could supply enough power for half the people on Earth
   with a solar cell farm on the moon. I just think the world is going to
   use the moon for practical purposes. And it makes sense that it should
   be a worldwide project.

   You mean we should involve the Europeans in this?

   Exactly. And I know for a fact that the Europeans have told NASA this,
   that they want to go to the moon, but they say they can't because NASA
   won't do it. We are captured by what NASA wants to do, they say. There
   are many in top NASA management who would prefer to make a return
   to the moon as the next step for the US and the rest of the nations
   involved in the ISS, but are reluctant to say so because of
   restrictions from the present administration.

   It seems like a lot of former astronauts, and some current ones who
   talk to me off the record, feel the same way.

   I talked to Neil Armstrong an awful lot near the end of this life. Too
   bad he's gone, because he was an important spokesman for being adverse
   to what the political part of NASA says we're going to do. Bolden,
   let's face it, he doesn't know what it takes to do a major project. He
   doesn't have experience with that. He's a flier, a Marine general. He's
   never known what it takes to do a massive program. He keeps talking
   about going to Mars in the 2030s, but that's pure, unadulterated, BS.
   And what have you got if you get there? Who wants to operate something
   that's 40 minutes, by voice, from the Earth. Why would you want to do
   that? As an operator, damned if I like that. If I'm on the moon, I've
   got a 3 second turnaround. Everything I go to do on Mars I've got to
   prepare to do in an automatic mode. That's not very smart. Pretty much
   everything we need to do on Mars can be done robotically. We've already
   got robots there. By the time we get the capability to send humans to
   Mars, it might be that robots are smarter than humans anyway. I'm
   serious.

   We're already seeing the impressive capabilities with robots like
   Curiosity.

   Yeah. Exactly. If you think about the practical aspects of going into
   space, there's no practical reason for going to Mars. But there is a
   practical reason for going to the moon. And furthermore, if you really
   want to go somewhere, get out of this solar system. Eventually that's
   what you're going to have to do. I don't know how to do that, but we'll
   figure out how to do it one day.

   A couple of weeks ago I had a pleasant morning at Johnson Space Center
   where they introduced eight bright, talented and accomplished [211]new
   astronaut candidates. I couldn't help but wonder where these men and
   women were going to fly to.

   For the last 10 years they've had trouble getting astronauts to go to
   the space station. I don't know if you know that, but a lot of people
   don't want to go to the space station. They don't want to spend six
   months there. Three people have to take care of the station while three
   people do science. That's three people 24 hours a day to keep the
   station operating. It's not a very good job for an astronaut.
   Astronauts want to do something that has some excitement to it. The
   engineers that come to JSC want to do something. You go talk to the
   guys who were doing Constellation, and the reason they came to NASA was
   to go back to the moon. They're all leaving now. The leaders are
   leaving for a lot of other reasons also, but they're leaving because
   there's no future that they want to be involved in. And that's
   unfortunate. You've got to have a reason for people to give you their
   lives. Which is what I did. I gave NASA my life not because they asked
   me to, but because I wanted to. I had a reason. But I just don't think
   that's there now. The livelihood of the organization is not very good.

   I heard that you recently spoke with the Johnson Space Center co-op
   students who made the wildly popular [212]NASA Johnson Style-video.
   What did you say to them?

   I gave `em hell. When the group did the NASA Johnson Style video, when
   I saw that, I said I want to go and speak to those guys. And so I did.
   I said look, "You just spent all of this effort to make a movie, how
   about spending all of that effort in making a space program go? Give me
   your body and mind and work on those kinds of things. I thought the
   video was beautiful, but that's not why you're here." I was very honest
   with them. They are the future of the program. If you can't keep them
   interested, you've lost it.

   Speaking of NASA's future, it seems like politically it's expedient to
   have centers all over the country. But is that the most efficient way
   to conduct a space program?

   [214]George Low (manager of the Apollo program and a NASA
   administrator) and myself got together in 1975, and he asked me how we
   could rebuild and reshape NASA to have a vibrant group of people. We
   knew we had five or six too many centers. We didn't need that many. Let
   the Jet Propulsion Laboratory do the unmanned stuff, and have two or
   three other centers do manned spaceflight. That's all NASA needed then,
   and needs now. But politics wouldn't let us do that. The centers are
   still going today, and some are getting bigger.

       he certainly doesn't pull any punches, does he? I agree with his
       position on the SLS (too costly, mission can be done by existing
       rockets), but disagree with the idea that we should rely too much
       on international opinion on what to do next with NASA. Remember,
       the last time we let international opinion decide where to put our
       research dollars, we ended up spending [232]$100 billion on a space
       station that nobody wants to fly to instead of completing the SCSC
       and the X-33/VentureStar.

            As a point of order, we didn't finish Station instead of
            X-33/VentureStar. The latter collapsed under the weight of
            NASA trying to do too many experimental technologies in one
            program and being unwilling to let Lockheed Martin try to fly
            X-33 with an aluminum tank.

            Justin, that's fair enough. But if we had started work on the
            X-33 before deciding to work on the ISS instead of after, I
            suspect that the requirement that the X-33 include the
            cryogenic tanks would have been dropped (especially as they
            increased the final weight of the system).

       NASA has become a bureaucracy focused more and more on budget
       politics and less and less on human space flight. Most experienced
       NASA people know that the budget is nibbled to death by earmarks
       and other fences built in Congress but accepted by NASA to direct
       money to places like Glenn (Cleveland) and Ames (Sunnyvale, CA) in
       return for votes. Langley (Virginia), is another center that is on
       the fringe of space flight, not the future. As a result, the $
       available at Kennedy, Johnson, and Marshall aren't there to perform
       the core space flight mission so programs drag, and enthusiasm
       flags.

       Luckily we have the tremendous positive impact on space exploration
       that the middle eastern muslim countries gave us. We might have
       brought back rocks from the moon, but not until after they threw
       rocks at the moon.

       "politics wouldn't let us do that"? Kraft concludes with the
       observation, common to most interested observers, that NASA has
       become a jobs and pork bureaucracy rather than an exciting agency
       with a challenging mission.

       "For the last 10 years they've had trouble getting astronauts to go
       to the space station. I don't know if you know that, but a lot of
       people don't want to go to the space station. "
       I have no problem believing this. What astronaut is going to want
       to spend months locked in a floating can stuck in low earth orbit?
       Very uninspiring. The occupation was once about exporing extreme
       environments. Cutting edge discovery and new technology. Now we
       tell them, they get to spend months conducting mundane experiments
       or housekeeping on the station. I am surprised they can find anyone
       willing to join the astronaut corps.

            I think that has more to do with NASA's tendency to select
            military aviators. Astronauts like Don Pettit made the most of
            their time at the Station and loved being there.

            A big part of any reluctance has to be requirement to spend
            many months in Russia - the astronauts have families in many
            cases. And for many of them, learning Russian is a distraction
            from their goals for becoming an astronaut - research in their
            field. All time spent learning to do the same things but in a
            different language is time taken away from their specialty,
            and they were picked largely because of their accomplishments
            in their specialty. None of them were picked because they were
            linguists.

       [247]September 3, 2013 at 9:28 am
       One point that cannot be discussed enough is the way that Congress
       uses all Federal programs as a construction project to bring jobs
       to their district - leading (for NASA) to excess "centers" being
       created and money dispersed. The best example is the Independent
       Verification and Validation facility in West Virginia. Any effort
       like that must be done at the Centers where work is actually done -
       KSC, MSFC, JSC in particular.
       NASA needs to close that facility in particular and shift the work
       to the other Centers. That is just an example of course, there is
       other reorganization that needs to be done.
       But once a program or facility is opened it is extremely tough to
       ever close it.

            re: "The IV&V is in West Virgina ..."
            What you call federal pork, the
            Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle
            Challenger Accident, in compliance with Executive Order 12546
            of February 3, 1986, calls "[serving] the best interests of
            the nation in restoring the United States space program to its
            preeminent position in the world."
            btw, who was the POTUS when that executive order was issued in
            1986?

            ion/table-of-contents.html
            or when "NASA's IV&V Program was established in 1993 as part
            of an Agency-wide strategy to provide the highest achievable
            levels of safety and cost-effectiveness for mission critical
            software"?

            I picked on the IV&V but IANVS inadvertently points out
            another problem with that center - independent verification
            (closely related to an aviation term Cockpit Resource
            Management) needs to be built into a system from the
            foundation. When you take verification and run it from a
            remote center, it becomes another hoop to jump through. If the
            program management takes safety, etc seriously it will have
            effective, independent verification. But can a center and a
            verification system chase around after programs to implement
            anything? No.

            long enough to accomplish the goal. No more of this "we'll
            fund you in full the first year (when we get great press) and

       This is to be expected when the president gives a mandate to NASA
       administrator Charles Bolden to "find a way to reach out to the
       Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to
       help them feel good about their historic contribution to science
       and engineering -- science, math and engineering".

            The fact that the current administration gave the mandate at
            all indicates it is NOT overblown. The leaders at NASA are
            afraid to voice their disagreement with the direction of the
            program...another by-product of the current administration.
            The agency, like all other federal agencies, has truly become
            a way to send the pork home without doing anything meaningful.
            Disband it or set a goal. What we have now is a mess. We don't
            even have a viable launch vehicle of our own and have to hitch
            rides from the Russians, for heaven's sake... What would
            Kennedy and Kruschev say about that?

            There was no such mandate. It appears nowhere in the National

            guidance NASA gives to the Directorates.

       They can't get people who want to go to the ISS because they are

       technician with a major telephone company and in the military so
       that sort of job would have been perfect for somebody like me since
       I'm not an astronaut anyway. To be up there maintaining things day

            I agree with Sgt Dave that maintenance tasks on the space
            station could be preform by someone other than a PHd
            astronaut. In fact, what would be a good idea is to have
            maintenance crews that spends 1 month a year (if that works
            when you factor in radiation) to service the space station, as
            well as, malfunctioning satellites.

       A big rocket would be useful to go back to the moon and eventually
       to Mars. The Saturn V cost around $1 billion per launch in today's
       dollars, and NASA could launch one every two months. Maybe NASA
       can't develop a big rocket any more. (That's really sad, if true.)
       But if you consider that SLS could be used for 50-60 years or more
       (like some of the Soviet designs), I don't think it's such a bad
       idea, assuming that the NASA budget grows to something like $30
       billion/year and America really commits to manned exploration of
       space again. But I'm not holding my breath; Americans are just not
       into science or space exploration.

       Being elderly myself I can easily see the wisdom in heeding the
       advice of your elders, but I can also say that if oil companies
       were still doing things the way we did when I first started the
       world would have run out of oil long ago.
       The problem with new technology is that you have to try it before
       you know if it will work. About 95% of what we tried in our labs
       went nowhere, but that 5% that did reshaped the business.
       I learned about 30 years ago that the new guys wanted to hear more
       about our failures than our successes because there was more to be
       learned from them. And politics drives some NASA decisions? If you
       think the government is bad try working for a major-major oil
       company.
       We went with the theory that it was best to try something and plan
       for it to work, and if it did not then we knew what would not work.
       But the worst possible approach to a problem is to do nothing, and
       doing things the way you have always done them is almost as bad as
       doing nothing.

       For the tiny slice of the federal budget pie NASA requests to carry
       out its mission, we get such a benefit to our country. New
       technologies come out of NASA's work. Our youth are inspired to
       engage in science and engineering. Our public's imagination is
       nurtured by the exploration of new places through the direct and
       indirect actions of NASA's astronauts and scientists. Our nation
       earns prestige for our innovation. We should have been back to the
       Moon already, and we should have our bootprints on Mars by now.
       It's a shame that we spend so much taxpayer money on wasteful
       projects, and those that benefit sociey's lazy and unproductive. A
       little goes a long way with NASA, and we should be happy to spend
       it. I wonder what my children will have to look forward to? It
       doesn't appear that manned launches to deep space are in the
       cards... and maybe not even launches into boring old Earth orbit.

       Thanks for this interview. The foolishness of the SLS seems to be
       obvious to everyone except congress. I think you can make good
       arguments for all three missions, moon, Mars, asteroid, but if we
       intend to be in space long term and make use of what we find there
       I think lunar is by far the most compelling. JSC continues to
       hemorrhage talent as projects wind down with nothing to replace
       them, going on two years now. We have no budget, no agreed upon
       mission, and little hope for change.

            building its own rockets and capsules. Unfortunately, the

            proposal was sub-standard and they didn't raise any money to
            host it. The only rubric under which SCH got an Orbiter was if

            you - I'm going with them.
            Of course, sticking a shuttle on the deck of a defunct
            aircraft carrier in New York without regard for hurricanes
            that `never' strike the east coast (ala Sandy) was a brilliant

            impressed.
            Not that this would be the first time I disagreed with others
            in my field. Introspection is usually one of the first things

            believed it deserved an Orbiter so much that it seems no one

       Kraft is a mission commander. He doesn't want NASA to go anywhere
       that a mission commander on the ground can't manage
       minute-by-minute. If we go even to an asteroid, the communcations
       time lag is too long, and the mission will actually have to be run
       from the spacecraft. This is intolerable to any NASA manager. You
       may remember from "The Right Stuff" that they didn't want the
       astronauts to even have a window, much less the opportunity to
       provide live control inputs. That attitude is still in place today.
       The shuttle was run 99.9% by autopilot. Even today, ground control
       "flies" the ISS minute by minute. They don't do a single thing
       without first getting approval from mission control.
       A moon base can still be operated from the ground; we proved this
       with all the Apollo missions. It will make a lot of people feel
       good but it's not going to advance our ability to get to Mars any
       more than the ISS does already.

       What's even sadder is that we could go back to the Moon if NASA
       would let go if that fixation that any return to the Moon has to
       look like Constellation.
       Simply using a lander the size of the Apollo lander or smaller
       would mean a lunar mission we could do with a single launch of the
       Falcon Heavy or two of the Delta IV Heavy.

            We could do the whole Apollo avionics on an iPhone these days.
            String 5 of them in parallel and you've got a hard redundant
            system. We don't need to fill every nook and cranny with
            beyond state of the art electronics to get back to the moon.
            Unfortunately I doubt that NASA's current safety protocols
            would let Apollo fly today.

       I'm delighted to see Kraft endorse the idea of propellant depots
       and slam SLS.
       The Obama administration had proposed some big changes. Giving the
       new kids (SpaceX, etc.) more action. R&D on orbital propellant
       storage and transfer. developing robotics.
       A lot of those were gutted by pork barrel politicians (mostly
       Republican but some Democrats) in favor of resurrecting HLV in the
       form of SLS.
       I am also happy to Kraft advocate going back to the moon.

       NASA, for quite a number of years, has been destroyed by politics
       and political correctness. That is both internally and externally.
       Just what did we accomplish with the shuttle program that could not
       have been done here on terra firma for less money, other than the
       Hubble? Originally we had a goal, go to the moon. The public
       supported that idea. For some reason, the public figured that if we
       beat the Russians to the moon, we were somewhat safer. The moon
       race had a lot of similarities to a big sporting event, a clearly
       defined & achievable goal, excitement, a dreaded competitor, and a
       fan base united in support of acheiving a clear victory. We were
       all proud when we got to the moon. All that has been missing ever
       since. And, in the meantime, our collective attention span has
       shortned. The public is divided in what we define as the role of
       government. The bunch in Washington, of every stripe, has fed that
       problem. Yes, there has been talk of sending a crew to Mars. But
       that is not realistic at this moment & out public attention span is
       too short and divided for a long term focus.

       instead of bombing a foreign country. instead of acting as the

       should build our own space station. We should build new and

       put these actions into affect immediately.

       NASA should be all about exploring the solar system, but NASA
       should not be building any rockets any more. IF NASA keeps building
       rockets, we will never go ANYWHERE! There is simply not enough
       money to build rockets AND explore. NASA should instead be spending
       the lion's share of their budget on exploration (i.e. on re-usable
       spacecraft like the Nautilis)and use the smaller portion of it's
       budget to purchase the means to get there from private industry.
       Soon Americans will be flying in space on American rockets and in
       American spacecraft. The irony is that these rockets and spacecraft
       will not be designed or controlled by NASA.
       SLS will be the death of NASA if it is not cancelled. If SLS
       survives to completion NASA will have become a one-trick SLS pony
       as all its resources will have had to be re-directed to building
       the SLS. And then if the SLS is completed there will be no money
       left to fly it or to build any payloads to lunch from it.
       The longer SLS continues, and it looks to be missing its milestones
       pretty regularly these days, the more marginalized NASA will
       become. Commercial space will be doing all the cool stuff while
       everyone sees NASA spinning its wheels never finishing its
       expensive shiny new rocket based on four-decade-old technology.
       The SLS may never fly, but that is hardly a problem, as it's
       supporters in Congress care not a whit about launching anything on
       the SLS. They just want to keep the pork flowing as long as
       possible to their constituents. They don't care that NASA is being
       starved by the hungry SLS.
       The only possible way out of this mess could come after Falcon
       Heavy flies next year and SpaceX announces upgrades to it's second
       stage engine allowing the Falcon Heavy to lift over 70mt. When this
       happens there will be no need for the SLS. Support for the SLS
       would be untenable and it might then be cancelled. Only this could
       save NASA and the American space program. But I'm not holding my
       breath.

            That would be nice, but the history of the Conestoga rocket

       Great interview. NASA is an organization trying to find a purpose.
       Oh, the real purpose is obvious, but deep down their purpose is to
       get funding and they think the only way to get funding is to
       showboat. That's the difference between the proposed asteroid
       mission and a comprehensive lunar exploration program. Going to an
       asteroid is a showboat ... throw a lot of $$ in a one-shot deal.
       Lunar exploration is long term and it is boring. Been there done
       that. I think the president essentially said that. But the rewards
       in the latter, for all humanity, are almost endless and we have
       literally barely scratched the surface. Sheesh.

       [304]September 4, 2013 at 8:40 am
       Been a fan of NASA since it's inception and really wanted to see us
       get to Mars in my lifetime. But the NASA manned program is dead,
       NASA just doesn't know it yet.
       The Bush Administration started the Constellation program and never
       funded it properly. This caused NASA to raid other programs to try
       to meed the directive. The result a project that was overrun and
       behind schedule. Obama cancels it, wasting all that was already
       spent to go to an asteroid (a joke), again without the proper
       funding or support in congress. The next president will surely
       cancel it since as the article shows it will be overrun and behind
       schedule again wasting all that was already spent. The next
       president will come up with another plan, maybe the one proposed
       here to go back to the moon, or something else but as before, there
       will be insufficient funding causing another cycle of wasted money
       and opportunity.
       Meanwhile the public sees all the waste and wants it stopped
       (rightly so) causing less and less chance to get any funding for
       anything. Trying to get the private sector to do space exploration
       is a bit of a joke. Corporations jump in as long as there is
       funding from NASA but until there is a viable profit motive the
       minute NASA stops funding they will bail.
       There are only two hopes on the horizon. First, when China gets to
       the moon maybe enough people will ask, what happened to NASA and
       want to do something about it. It may stir the public and the
       incompetents in congress to do something about it but just like the
       moon race it will be for the wrong reason. The right reason is for
       exploration itself not to beat someone. Or second, if Dennis Tito
       pulls off his flyby of Mars in 2018 ( a long shot) there may be
       enough public response to get back in the game.
       It is all just so sad.

            I agree with most of this. What I disagree with is that the
            public sees NASA as a waste. It does not. The space agency has
            overwhelmingly positive ratings among the public.
            Unfortunately I don't think the public realizes what a dire
            situation the human spaceflight program is in.

            Obama cancels it, wasting all that was already spent to go to
            an asteroid (a joke), again without the proper funding or
            support in congress.
            Two points:
            1) Obama wasn't the first president to radically change the
            direction of NASA; indeed, that has become something of a
            tradition in DC. Nixon killed Apollo to fund the shuttle.
            Carter tried to kill the shuttle. Reagan stopped shuttle
            production in order to fund Space Station Freedom. Bush41
            killed the station to go to Mars. Clinton killed Mars to build
            the ISS and the shuttle's replacement. And Bush43 killed the
            shuttle's replacement and tried to kill the ISS to pay for
            Constellation.
            2) Going to an asteroid is not a joke. There are many good
            scientific reasons to want to go to an asteroid; for one, they
            tell us more about the early Solar System than the Moon or
            Mars will. And there are many economic reasons to want to go
            to an asteroid; ask [309]Planetary Resources if you doubt me.
            The right space exploration plan would be "all of the above" -
            bases on Moon and Mars and trips to near Earth asteroids with
            probes to those places we can't go (e.g., Europa). But, given
            that we can't even get Congress to pay for any single one of
            those goals, "all of the above" simply isn't going to happen.

            [310]September 4, 2013 at 9:50 am
            Didn't mean to imply that the public sees NASA itself as a
            waste, just that they do see canceled programs and constant
            changes in direction as a waste. That said, NASA hasn't done
            the best job in keeping the public excited. Yes, successes
            like Curiosity get attention but they are woefully unaware of
            the many other achievements.

       I do not think the public is delighted with what is going on at
       NASA, but rightly, at least to a large part, put the blame on
       Washington. The general public trust NASA much more than they trust

       An agency that ran off von Braun and let Skylab burn up has tipped
       its hand as to what its all about. Its all about money, power, and
       politics. Not about exploration. That was a long time ago that the
       agency went adrift and yet people didn't seem to notice. I was a
       little kid asking, "why did they let Skylab burn up?" As an adult I

       approve untold billions on a new space station.
