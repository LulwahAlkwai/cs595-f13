[4]To succeed, adopt the post-industrial view

   From time to time, students ask me wether such degree or certificate in
   computer science will help them get a good job. There is no shortage of
   studies showing that degrees lead to good jobs. That might be true, but
   there are also many young (and not-so-young) people who are depressed
   by their career. This sad state of affairs comes, I believe, from an
   industrial viewpoint. People seek "certifications" of all sorts, just
   like factories seek to get "certifications" for their products.

   Maybe getting a computer science degree from a leading school feels
   like "ambition" or "a quest for excellence", but it is so only if you
   adopt an industrial viewpoint. In truth, you are more or less going
   through the motions.

   The problem is summarized nicely by [5]Vivek Haldar:

     I've been a TA for a number of CS classes while in grad school, and
     I've conducted many interviews for software engineer positions. Just
     from my narrow anecdotal window, it is amazing how many CS students
     just want to figure out the bare minimum to pass the class; and how
     many grads do not have a decent grasp of elementary algorithms and
     data structures, and are not comfortable with code.

   Vivek is trying to be nice: he knows that there is more than just
   anecdotal evidence. Too many students assume that taking a couple of
   programming classes is all you need to be a developer.

   In an industrial universe, we seek standardization. You are either a
   software developer, or you are not. If some well-known school says that
   you are a competent software engineer, then you are. Conformism is
   preferred to initiative. Going beyond the call of duty is for suckers:
   do what you are asked, no more. You can also expect the next 5 years to
   be like the previous 5 years. All you have to do is to be consistent.

   In a post-industrial world, you have to adopt different strategies:
     * Instead of seeking a "certificate" that supposedly show that you
       know how to behave nicely and get work done... start getting actual
       work done, and behave nicely. Then tell the world about it. The
       certificate or degree becomes just one element in a wide portfolio.
     * Instead of waiting to be told what to do, start figuring out by
       yourself what you should do. Please don't wait for a professor to
       tell you how to build a software application. Go out on your own
       and figure it out. Better yet: figure out how to get paid for it.
     * Never assume that skills in demand today will be in demand
       tomorrow. Go learn a new programming language even if no professor
       told you to do so.

   If you behave as a cog in the machine, you will be treated as such, and
   you are likely to learn to regret it.

    1. Yes, one could be surprised to learn how many CS students dislike
       coding.
