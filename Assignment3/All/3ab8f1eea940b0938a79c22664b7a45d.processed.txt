     * [26]WHAT'S NEW!

   BOSTON, MA (September 10, 2013) - Governor Deval Patrick will join
   LearnLaunchX, an education tech-focused accelerator based in Boston, at
   their inaugural demo day September 18 featuring seven early stage
   companies.

   LearnLaunchX, founded this past February, selected seven companies to
   accelerate after a competitive selection process. Companies received
   $18,000 in seed funding, an intensive three month mentoring program
   which began in June, and office space for six months. The companies
   were chosen for their exceptional potential to make education more
   effective, impactful, accessible and affordable across the education
   continuum.

   [27]Companies that will participate in LearnLaunchX's demo day:

   [28]Listen Edition: Public radio stories, lesson plans and activities
   that enliven STEM and social studies curriculum, foster critical
   thinking and listening skills, and align with Common Core State
   Standards (CCSS), led by respected public radio reporter Monica
   Brady-Myerov.

   [29]Gradeable: A new assessment and feedback tool that helps teachers
   give students smarter, faster feedback and reduces their overall
   workload. Developed by a team from MIT and Harvard, it uses optical
   character recognition to handle paper inputs in both written answer and
   multiple choices formats, and provides simple, visually appealing
   reports.

   [30]Cognii: Using powerful natural language processing technology,
   Cognii enables automatic assessment of students' essay answers. Cognii
   helps learning service providers create personalized and engaging
   learning environments which can measure students' content mastery.

   [31]Empow Studios: Bringing technology, arts, and learning together,
   Empow Studios helps young learners discover and build talents that will
   prepare them to navigate, master, and thrive in their future careers
   and lives. Empow Studios programs teach exciting robotics, video game
   design, animation, and other creative skills for the 21st century to
   kids 4 through 15 years old through after-school, holiday, and summer
   programs. Opening in Lexington Town Center this fall, the company is
   poised to grow to new communities and regions through franchising.

   [32]Countdown: A planning tool for creating Common Core-aligned
   instruction that allows teachers and districts to map standards by day
   across the school year, link curricular resources, share calendars,
   manage changes and create a record of what is taught. Countdown
   improves pacing, increases the effectiveness of co-teaching and
   supports standards-based teaching and learning.

   [33]EduCanon: Powerful, easy-to-use video tools for teachers to create
   highly engaging and interactive video instruction. EduCanon adds
   formative assessments into videos, and empowers teachers to quickly
   identify and track students' grasp of concepts. Created by teachers,
   for teachers.

   [34]Intellify Learning: Provides a standards-based instrumentation
   framework for online course developers and schools, curriculum and
   learning designers, and Ed tech application developers. Led by
   LearnLaunchX entrepreneur-in-residence Chris Vento, former CTO of
   Blackboard, WebCT and Cengage, Intellify's cloud-delivered data and
   analytics drive the progressive refinement of on-line learning
   experiences.

   Investing in innovation to create jobs and opportunity in the state has
   been a key part of Patrick's growth strategy. By making meaningful,
   targeted investments in education, innovation and infrastructure, the
   state has seen job numbers return to pre-recession levels, and
   unemployment remain below the national average. These investments,
   especially in the innovation sector, have positioned Massachusetts as a
   global leader in the life sciences, biotech, bio pharmaceuticals and
   IT, as a national leader in clean energy and Massachusetts students
   lead the nation in achievement.
