   Rob Enderle's post on Tech & Science | Latest updates on Sulia
   iPhone 5S likely to Start Smartphone Theft Tsunami
   That appears to be what the Huffington Post is arguing today. Thefts
   have been on the increase largely thanks to how easy it is to get cash
   for new phones. While the fingerprint reader should make the phones a
   bit less valuable to a thief until folks figure out a way around them,
   people that steal smartphones aren't exactly rocket scientists and
   given how valuable this phone is initially believed to be you likely
   should be very careful with yours. Walking down a city street oblivious
   to what is going on around you and holding the phone in plain sight,
   hell holding any iPhone in plain sight (thieves aren't known for their
   visual acuity either) is probably a great way to become an ex-iPhone
   owner. I'd start being really careful now because thieves may not have
   caught that the new phones don't come out until Friday and screaming,
   "stop that isn't an iPhone 5S", probably won't get them to give it
   back. Huffington Post article on this here:
