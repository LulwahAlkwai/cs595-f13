Is Reuters inserting editorial comment into its coverage of climate change?

   [41]Is Reuters inserting editorial comment into its coverage of climate
   change?

   David Fogarty, a former environmental reporter for Reuters, says the
   news agency decided in early 2012 that environmental stories would no
   longer be a top priority. As a consequence, he says, editors are now
   wary of climate change stories, reflecting "a climate of fear" inside
   the company.

   Strong stuff, if true. The charge [42]comes in a July 15th post at The
   Baron, an independent blog covering Reuters and its people. Fogarty
   left Reuters, he writes, when he was stripped of his environmental beat
   and offered a role covering "regional shipping."

   "Since I've left, I've lost count of the number of people who have
   asked me why Reuters' climate change coverage has changed in tone and
   fallen in volume," he concludes. Fogarty, who was based in Singapore,
   is one of three reporters who have been taken off the environment beat,
   according to [43]a July 12th post at The Baron. The other two are
   Alister Doyle in Oslo, who has written about the environment for a
   decade, and Deborah Zabarenko in Washington, who has covered the
   environment and climate change since 2006, The Baron reports.

   Fogarty intimates--but oddly does not say outright--that the person
   behind the climate of fear is Paul Ingrassia, a Pulitzer-Prize-winning
   reporter who joined Reuters in 2011 and was recently named managing
   editor:

     In April last year, Paul Ingrassia (then deputy editor-in-chief) and
     I met and had a chat at a company function. He told me he was a
     climate change sceptic. Not a rabid sceptic, just someone who wanted
     to see more evidence mankind was changing the global climate.

     Progressively, getting any climate change-themed story published got
     harder.

   That seems to blame Ingrassia, but Fogarty is an experienced reporter
   and writer and he was careful not to say that Ingrassia was responsible
   for the growing difficulty in getting climate stories published. I
   think he's guessing that Ingrassia is responsible; he doesn't know, or
   he would have said so.

   It's disturbing that Reuters took three environmental reporters off the
   beat, but, up to this point, we still don't know whether Reuters's
   coverage of climate change has been altered, by Ingrassia or anyone
   else.

   On Tuesday, we got some data that addresses that question. Media
   Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog, looked at Reuters
   stories before Ingrassia's previous appointment as deputy
   editor-in-chief and again in 2012, after he was in place.

   The number of stories on climate change dropped by 48 percent,
   [44]Media Matters reports. One explanation is that Reuters decided to
   de-emphasize climate change coverage. Another is that there was less
   climate change news in 2012. While this therefore does not constitute
   proof of a change in corporate policy, it does look suspicious.

   The case against Reuters was strengthened, in my view, by[45] a July
   21st post by Joe Romm at the progressive ClimateProgress blog, in which
   he points out specific instances of unsourced climate skepticism
   inserted into a Reuters story.

   The post, entitled "False balance lives at Reuters," examines Reuters
   coverage of a recent[46] story on sea level rise from the Potsdam
   Institute for Climate Impact Research. The[47] Reuters story, as Romm
   points out, contains this unattributed criticism of the report:

     Scientists say global warming is responsible for the melting ice. A
     U.N. panel of scientists, the IPCC, says heat-trapping gases from
     burning fossil fuels are nudging up temperatures. A small number of
     scientists dismiss human-influenced global warming, arguing natural
     climate fluctuations are responsible. [Emphasis mine.]

   Later on, we find this in the Reuters story--again without attribution:

     Climate sceptics, however, say the evidence is unconvincing.
     Measurements of changing temperatures are unreliable, contradictory
     and unsupported by solid historic data, they say.

     They question the accuracy of computer climate forecasts and point
     to historic, cyclical changes in the world's temperature as evidence
     that global temperature changes are natural. Others say the evidence
     shows temperatures have stopped rising and that the sun plays a
     bigger role than human activities.

   Romm says these ideas have been "thoroughly refuted," but one doesn't
   have to know anything about prior studies or refutations to recognize
   bad journalism. Controversial points of view such as these included by
   Reuters should never be unattributed. It's one thing to say, without
   attribution, that the Earth is round, but it's quite another to
   speculate about the causes of climate change without attributing and
   backing up that speculation.

   Reuters [48]told ClimateProgress that it "is committed to providing
   fair and independent coverage of climate change," that it has "a number
   of staff dedicated to covering this story," and "there has been no
   change in our editorial policy."

   None of this proves that Reuters has decided to adopt a skeptical
   editorial stance in its news coverage. But if it has, then a change in
   its editorial policy is exactly what it needs.

   Look, let's get real: Reuters "news" is just the public relations tip
   of a massive, international conglomerate called Thomson Reuters
   Corporation which deals in real estate, pharmaceuticals, legal and
   financial services, business and government consulting, tax accounting
   and on and on. It is a really major real estate firm with holdings all
   over the world to protect from political unrest etc. Its climate
   denying "news" arm is so conflicted (climate is just one aspect) that
   if Reuter's readers actually knew what TRC is up to beneath its oh so
   pure journalistic masque, they would toss their tapas.

   False balance rears its ugly head, indeed. And you're right: How could
   Reuters do this? Difficult to understand.

   Thanks for picking up on this Paul. The case is convincing. But it
   remains hard  to believe that a news agency of Reuters's stature would
   decide that accomplished environmental writers such as Doyle and
   Zabarenko should do something else aside from cover the most
   significant environmental threat facing humankind. Not only that, but
   believes that one should give comparable weight to the fringe and to
   outright crackpottery as to mainstream research. Oh, wait a sec. Most
   of a long-established US political party with a rich history has done
   the same thing!
