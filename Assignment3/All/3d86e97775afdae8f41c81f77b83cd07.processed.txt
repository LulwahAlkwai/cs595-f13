[3]Celebrating Maths in Oxford

   [4][photo.JPG]
   This week I'm in Oxford for the [5]opening of the new Andrew Wiles
   Mathematical Institute building and the [6]Clay Research Conference
   including on workshop on [7]New Insights on Computational
   Intractability.
   The building is beautiful with two small towers, one each for pure and
   applied math, and a common room joining them. The downstairs, where the
   talks are being held, is separated from the tower by its own glass
   dome, so, I was told, that the noise of the students don't disturb the
   great thinkers above.
   The Clay Math Institute, best known in our circles for the [8]millenium
   prize problems, has moved to Oxford from Cambridge (Massachusetts) and
   will take up residence in this new building. Unlike Jim Simons, Landon
   Clay didn't have a particular math background but was looking for a
   purpose for a charitable foundation. He met Andrew Wiles and loved the
   story of his proof of Fermat's last theorem and Clay realized the need
   for basic math research. Besides the millenium problems, the institute
   sponsors a number of research fellows and the move to Oxford reflects a
   transition to funding American mathematicians to a more international
   base.
   What about the new insights into intractability? Lots of great talks on
   connections to physics and economics, on proof complexity, information
   theory, algebraic and circuit complexity. On the other hand I watched
   some talks on other millenium prizes and while difficult to follow, it
   looks like they have measured progress towards resolving their
   problems. In complexity, we're still searching for that true path
   towards P != NP.

[17]Long Tails and Fat Heads

   Sometimes words or phrases are used in MATH and then spread to the REAL
   WORLD. I have blogged about how the terms Prisoner's Dilemma has become
   a real-world-phrase [18]here and speculated about the terms Venn
   Diagram, Zeno's Paradox, and n+1 [19]here.
   I recently came across a pair of words that are related--- one of them
   seems to be (like Prisoner's Dilemma) going from MATH to THE REAL
   WORLD. The other one is very odd in that I've seen it in the REAL WORLD
   but it SHOULD be in MATH.
   Long Tail: A Probability distribution has a long tail if there are MANY
   items that have a SMALL but NON-ZERO prob of happening. This is a term
   in probability. However, I have seen it used in the REAL WORLD as in
   Amazon has a long-tail strategy meaning that they will sell LOTS of
   DIFFERENT things even if the number of people buying some of them is
   small (like [20]this which is ranked 9,578,520- though I doubt they can
   be that precise). [21]This article from the Atlantic Monthly points out
   that ESPN used to have a long tail strategy (e.g., showing Billiards
   and others sports that are not that popular, but ALOT of them) but then
   abandoned it for... see next definition. Note that the term Long Tail
   is used for both a type of Prob Dist and a marketing strategy related
   to it. How common a word is Long Tail? It gets 66,500,000 hits on
   Google. The first page has the definition above only. The 10th page had
   about half of the hits with the def above.
   Fat Head: A strategy where you concentrate on just a few items. ESPN is
   doing that by covering just a few sports, but the most-watched ones
   (too bad, I was hoping they would cover my favorite sport, [22]chess
   boxing). This SHOULD be a math term for a Prob Dist with just a few
   points of high prob. I asked my friends in the ML community and he
   assures me that NO its not a math term--- but it SHOULD be! How common
   a word is this? It gets 2,300,000 hits on Google. The first page seems
   to have NOT have ANY reference to the definition above.
   SO- this COULD be a case where a term used in the REAL WORLD migrates
   to MATH with essentiallythe same meaning. This isn't that uncommon (the
   term Continuity comes to mind) but this timeI will have predicted it!
   Maybe I should do Machine Learning.

[43]Dealing with Death

   Mary Jean Harrold, a professor of software engineering at Georgia Tech,
   [44]passed away last week. Mary Jean was 67 and still quite active
   before the cancer struck.
   Computer science is still a relatively young field and most of even the
   early computer scientists remain quite alive. So a death in the field,
   particularly a colleague, makes a mark because it typically is
   happening at a young age. I've lost five co-authors (Avner Magen, Steve
   Mahaney, Andrej Muchnik, Nick Reingold, Carl Smith) all well before
   their time. Each death is a stark reminder of what's important in life,
   what does the next theorem mean when life seems so short?
   We're nearing a time in computer science that many of our ranks will
   die after living to a ripe old age. Those remembrances will be of a
   life well lived. But there will always be lives cut short. The best we
   can do is remember them and move on and continue to build on the
   research tradition they left behind.

[53]Crystal Math- What NUMB3RS and BREAKING BAD both get wrong

   The TV show [54]Numb3rs  had as a premise that a GENIUS mathematician
   could help solve crimes. Is this true? I rather doubt you need a
   GENIUS-
   though of course some prob, state, data mining,  the math behind
   forensics, and a few other things help. And it may help to know some
   number theory if a mathematician who is working on the Riemann
   hypothesis has his daughter kidnapped.  But I don't think you need
   someone on the level of [55]Charles Eppes.
   The TV show [56]Breaking Bad  (see [57]Honest Trailor for Breaking Bad
   and/or
   [58]Idiots Guide to Breaking Bad if you've seen the first 4.5 seaons at
   least)
   has as a premise that a GENIUS chemist can make really good crystal
   meth. And as a by product it's blue. I know nothing about the crystal
   meth business; however a chemist friend of mine (who has never made the
   stuff) tells me that YES, being a careful chemist is good, and
   certainly better than a meth-head who is more likely to blow up his lab
   than to produce any, a GENIUS chemist would not be any better than a
   good chemist.
   The TV show [59]Elementary  (Sherlock Holmes in modern day New York)
   and many other shows (Monk, Perception, Psyche, The Mentalist, Columbo,
   and others I am sure) has as a premise that a GENIUS observer could
   help solve crimes. This may be more true then the above, but there are
   other tools available today (e.g., DNA).
   All of these shows, and others, make the  FALLACY OF EXTRAPOLATION.
   Taking a good idea and extrapolating it to absurdity.
   Here is a non-TV example: If blogging is part of my job, and I can
   deduct job expenses for Tax purposes, then I should be able to deduct
   the cost of the DVD's for Numb3rs that I bought because of this post.

[68]STOC CFP still delayed- but I was asked to pass this along

   Since there were comments on the blog about the STOC and CCC CFP not
   being out yet I mailed various people who are in-the-know. I got email
   from David Shmoys  (STOC PC chair 2014) telling me
   (1)  The  STOC the call is still delayed,
   (2)  There is a website about it, [69]here, that is INCORRECT - the
   REAL deadline for submission will be Nov 11, 2013 (4PM east coast
   time.)
   (3) Please post this correction on complexity blog.
   (So I just did.)
   Note that Lance and I are NOT involved with the organization of STOC or
   CCC. The blog entry is just passing along information.

[78]tl;dr

   Every now and then we need new words and phrases come into our lexicon,
   like the unfortunate "twerking", but here's another "tl;dr", short for
   "too long; didn't read". I'm guessing it started as an insult/excuse
   not to read a long document, blog post or email. Respond "tl;dr" and
   you've put the blame on the writer for being too loquacious to the
   tweet-friendly generation.
   Now I see tl;dr used as a short synopsis sometimes by the author
   themselves, the new executive summary if the executive has six seconds
   to read. Maybe I should tl;dr my class lectures: "Finite Automata: Easy
   to analyze but too weak to do much interesting".
   Are we really moving to this brave new world of micro-attention spans?
   Is this just another reason that newspapers are dying and blogs are
   passé? When I write email should I keep it short and be misunderstood,
   make it long and have it not be read or add a tl;dr summary and get the
   worst of both worlds?

[87]Did YOU think the NSA could factor fast?

   Before the recent revelations about the NSA (see [88]Lances Post and
   [89]Scott's post )I would tell my class, when teaching P and NP,

     We have very good reasons to think that Factoring is NOT
     NP-complete. As for P--- much murkier. People have tried to get it
     into P because of crypto and have not succeeded, hence many people
     think that Factoring is NOT in P. But there is so much math there
     that perhaps could be exploited to show it IS in P. Another very odd
     possibility is that it is KNOWN to be in P but only by the NSA.
     Crytpo has had this before- where some concepts were known to
     governments before they were known to the public,  even the academic
     public.

   I will need to revise that now. BEFORE the recent revelations there
   were
   the following points of view on factoring:
    1. The NSA cannot factor any better than what is known in the
       literature. Maybe a bit better because they use more parallelism.
    2. The NSA has taken the known algorithms and found the right
       parameters and has special purpose hardware so can do them better
       than anyone else, but nothing of interest mathematically. Perhaps
       some very interesting subtle points of math and hardware. What they
       have would not get into STOC/FOCS/CRYPTO (though maybe it should-
       that's another debate). This is the one I believed.
    3. The NSA has an algorithm that is better than the literature (e.g.,
       exponential in (log n)^{1/5}).  But not in P. This would surely get
       into STOC/FOCS/CRYPTO and win a prize.
    4. The NSA has factoring in P through some very interesting and new
       mathematics. If this was public then perhaps a Turing Award.  Some
       serious number theorists do think that Factoring IS in P, so this
       one is not quite so implausible.
    5. The NSA has a quantum computer that factors quickly. I do not now
       of anyone serious who believed this. Of course, this could be a
       case of the [90]No True Scotsman Paradox--- if someone really
       believed this I would (perhaps unfairly) declare them non-serious.
    6. The NSA does not have a better algorithm, but has managed to put
       trapdoors in stuff so that they and only they could break certain
       codes.(A covert version of [91]Clipper Chip.) So they can break
       codes but not in a way that is interesting mathematically.

   There may be more but I don't know them off hand. Item 6 I never heard
   people say, though that might be a function of the company I keep. I do
   not know what the most common view was, but I would guess item 2.This
   reminds me of  [92]Karmarkar's Algorithm which I've heard runs fast
   because of the implementation- the algorithm is not a secret but
   exactly how they implement it is. (Note- just because I've heard this
   does not mean it's true.)
   The truth seems to be that the truth is between 1 and 2, closer to 1,
   and also item 6.
   In particular, the NSA does not seem that much ahead of academics.
   In the past governments were way  ahead of academics in crypto. This no
   longer seems to be the case (at least in America). I speculate that
   this is because there is now a large community  of people doing
   research in crypto openly, publishing openly, so the government is no
   longer the only (or almost the only) game in town. Also, many
   non-government industries use crypto and some do research in it. This
   also helps the NSA- they can use results in the open literature, but
   they can't get that much ahead of it.
   Are there other fields where the government is ahead of academics and
   industry? On a guess stuff with weapons and weapon detection, since not
   many academics work on that. Maybe sociology since the government has
   census data and other data that is not available to the public.
