   Technology, and Public Policy


OVERVIEW

   African agriculture is currently at a crossroads, at which persistent
   food shortages are compounded by threats from climate change. But, as
   this book argues, Africa faces three major opportunities that can
   transform its agriculture into a force for economic growth: advances in
   science and technology; the creation of regional markets; and the
   emergence of a new crop of entrepreneurial leaders dedicated to the
   continent's economic improvement.
   Filled with case studies from within Africa and success stories from
   developing nations around the world, The New Harvest outlines the
   policies and institutional changes necessary to promote agricultural
   innovation across the African continent. Incorporating research from
   academia, government, civil society, and private industry, the book
   suggests multiple ways that individual African countries can work
   together at the regional level to develop local knowledge and
   resources, harness technological innovation, encourage
   entrepreneurship, increase agricultural output, create markets, and
   improve infrastructure.
   The New Harvest is a product of the Agricultural Innovation in Africa
   Project, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

   Features:
     * Integrates research and policy ideas from an international panel of
       some of the most influential thinkers on agricultural development
     * Presents enactable policy ideas for advancing agriculture
       throughout Africa, at the national and regional levels
     * Includes a wealth of case study material from Green Revolution and
       educational initiatives in India, China, and throughout Latin
       America

Praise for The New Harvest

   "Calestous Juma draws on a rich harvest of research to write a
   convincing analysis of the importance of innovation and
   entrepreneurship in the agricultural sectors of Africa. Hopefully, it
   will be widely read by scholars and policy analysts across Africa as
   well as outside. It is a great book."Elinor Ostrom, Professor of
   Political Science, Indiana University, and 2009 Nobel Laureate in
   Economic Sciences

   "Calestous Juma has once again produced a book that will be an
   important reference for scholars, researchers and practitioners in
   their search for ways to break the persistent conundrum that is
   Africa's failure to properly exploit its huge agricultural potential.
   The book reveals his exceptional ability to express ideas that will be
   relevant to the emerging trends in Africa's agricultural and political
   economy."Monty Jones, Executive Director, Forum for Agricultural
   Research in Africa, and 2004 World Food Prize Laureate

   "This book presents a timely analysis of the importance of
   infrastructure in improving Africa's agriculture. Leaders at national
   and state levels will benefit immensely from its evidence-based
   recommendations."Goodluck Jonathan, President of the Federal Republic
   of Nigeria

   "This book is a forceful reminder of the important role that African
   women play in agriculture on the continent.is critical that they are
   provided with equal educational opportunity as a starting pointbuilding
   a new economic future for the continent."Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,
   President of the Republic of Liberia

   "New technologies, especially biotechnology, provide African countries
   with additional tools for improving the welfare of farmers. I commend
   this book for the emphasis it places on the critical role that
   technological innovation plays in agriculture. The study is a timely
   handbook for those seeking new ways of harnessing new technologies for
   development, including poor farmers, many of whom are women."Blaise
   Compaore, President of Burkina Faso

   "The New Harvest the importance of global learning in Africa's
   agricultural development. It offers new ideas for international
   cooperation on sustainable agriculture in the tropics. It will pave the
   way for improved collaboration between Africa and South America."Laura
   Chincilla, President of Costa Rica
