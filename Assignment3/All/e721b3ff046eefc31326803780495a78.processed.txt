   VCE's Strategic Advantage: Best of Breed Process
   In my weekly Datamation column I cover my bit Ah-Hah conclusion from
   the latest VCE briefing. And that is what really makes them different
   isn't product but the process they use to make a best of breed type of
   solution work. Typically these look good on paper but are a nightmare
   to implement and manage, VCE has figured out a way to flip this so that
   best of breed can actually go in more quickly and easily than a
   vertically integrated solution. It really is amazing and it is worth
   meeting with them just to understand this amazing process. This is the
   core of my Datamation column this week:
