California needs a new Master Plan

Op-Ed

Retiring Chancellor Charles Reed outlines what must be done to save the
state's once-envied public higher education system.

   California's public higher education system, once the envy of the
   world, is struggling. To survive in a way that continues to fulfill its
   mission, we need to break the mold on how it operates.

   State budget cuts have stripped our universities to the bone. And the
   promise of nearly free, accessible higher education has all but
   disappeared as cuts have forced tuition increases. What was once a rite
   of passage for all qualified young people is increasingly becoming
   untenable for many prospective students.

   IFRAME: [142]about:blank

   Some lucky people may have the option to simply choose another
   university, perhaps a private institution. But many more students,
   particularly those from low-income and traditionally underserved
   backgrounds, may have no choice but to forgo a university degree. This
   situation has caused those of us who have spent our careers advocating
   for accessible public higher education to ask: Is this the direction
   our state -- and sooner or later our country -- should be taking?

   During the "golden days" of public higher education, particularly in
   California, universities played a crucial role in the growth of
   post-World War II America. Public universities gave returning GIs and
   other young people an opportunity to learn skills, land jobs and take
   their place in the nation's booming middle class.

   Today, public higher education is just as important, if not more so, in
   workforce success. The pathway to a good job is through knowledge-based
   and creative industries, such as biotechnology and computer science,
   that require a college degree. Getting off the college track means
   missing out on the fastest-growing and best-paying careers.

   In order to remain accessible to the students it is designed to reach,
   public higher education is going to have to look very different in
   terms of both funding and structure. We are going to need new
   strategies, such as:

   Operating year-round, online. Why shouldn't students -- especially
   those who must work -- be able to study when and where they need to?
   The best way to make college accessible is to make the classes
   accessible any time, anywhere.

   Creating a career-based funding model. Scrap the tuition/fees model for
   needs-based financial aid and consider a system that charges a fixed
   cost for a degree. For example, it might cost $25,000 to become a
   teacher and $40,000 to become an engineer. The money would go to the
   institution to cover the costs of the degree. When students graduate
   and get jobs, they pay back the money through income taxes. A teacher
   would have a smaller payback, for example, than an engineer, who
   presumably would earn a higher salary. Those who stay in the chosen
   career in the state for a fixed number of years would pay less.

   Building stronger partnerships with underserved communities. Public
   universities need to do outreach to help prospective students
   understand what it takes to get to college, and help them get there.
   The California State University's Super Sunday program in African
   American churches is a great example of how direct and focused
   attention to a community can help more students get on the right track.

   Requiring specifics in accountability. Public universities need to
   demonstrate how they are contributing to the cause, and that means
   regular reporting of enrollment, demographics and graduation
   statistics. A university should be able to report, for example, how
   many Pell grant students have graduated, or how many graduates have
   gone on to become engineers. CSU has such information on every campus'
   website. Students and parents can use it to assess net tuition and
   whether the school is a good fit; policymakers can look at it to see
   how efficient a university is, as well as understand student
   demographics; and it would give the public a better understanding of
   the role the university plays in the workforce.

   IFRAME: [143]about:blank

   Will policymakers be able to create any or all of these changes? If
   they don't, our public universities are on the path toward becoming a
   very exclusive club, leaving out the very students who make up the bulk
   of our future workforce and economy. And if higher education abandons
   these students, we do so at our country's economic peril.

   Charles B. Reed, chancellor for the last 14 years of the 23-campus
   California State University, the nation's largest university system, is
   retiring at the end of the year.
