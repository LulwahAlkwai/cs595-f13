       FILE - People swim and sunbathe at Goose Lake in Anchorage, Alaska
       on Monday, June 17, 2013. Alaska's largest city and other parts of
       the state are experiencing a long stretch of higher than normal
       temperatures. The jet stream, the river of air high above Earth
       that generally dictates the weather, usually rushes rapidly from
       west to east in a mostly straight direction. But lately it seems to
       be wobbling and weaving like a drunk driver, wreaking havoc as it
       goes. The most recent example is mid-June where some towns in
       Alaska hit record highs. (AP Photo/Rachel D'Oro)

       "It's been just a crazy fall and winter and spring all along,
       following a very abnormal sea ice condition in the Arctic," Francis
       said, noting that last year set a record low for summer sea ice in
       the Arctic. "It's possible what we're seeing in this unusual
       weather is all connected." (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lately, the jet stream isn't playing by the rules.
   Scientists say that big river of air high above Earth that dictates
   much of the weather for the Northern Hemisphere has been unusually
   erratic the past few years.

   They blame it for everything from snowstorms in May to the path of
   Superstorm Sandy.

   And last week, it was responsible for downpours that led to historic
   floods in Alberta, Canada, as well as record-breaking heat in parts of
   Alaska, experts say. The town of McGrath, Alaska, hit 94. Just a few
   weeks earlier, the same spot was 15 degrees.

   The current heat wave in the Northeast is also linked. "While it's not
   unusual to have a heat wave in the east in June, it is part of the
   anomalous jet stream pattern that was responsible for the flooding in
   Alberta," Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis said
   Tuesday in an email.

   The jet stream usually rushes rapidly from west to east in a mostly
   straight direction. But lately it's been wobbling and weaving like a
   drunken driver, wreaking havoc as it goes. The more the jet stream
   undulates north and south, the more changeable and extreme the weather.

   It's a relatively new phenomenon that scientists are still trying to
   understand. Some say it's related to global warming; others say it's
   not.

   In May, there was upside-down weather: Early California wildfires
   fueled by heat contrasted with more than a foot of snow in Minnesota.
   Seattle was the hottest spot in the nation one day, and Maine and
   Edmonton, Canada, were warmer than Miami and Phoenix.

   Consider these unusual occurrences over the past few years:

   -- The winter of 2011-12 seemed to disappear, with little snow and
   record warmth in March. That was followed by the winter of 2012-13 when
   nor'easters seemed to queue up to strike the same coastal areas
   repeatedly.

   -- Superstorm Sandy took an odd left turn in October from the Atlantic
   straight into New Jersey, something that happens once every 700 years
   or so.

   -- One 12-month period had a record number of tornadoes. That was
   followed by 12 months that set a record for lack of tornadoes.

   And here is what federal weather officials call a "spring paradox": The
   U.S. had both an unusually large area of snow cover in March and April
   and a near-record low area of snow cover in May. The entire Northern
   Hemisphere had record snow coverage area in December but the third
   lowest snow extent for May.

   "I've been doing meteorology for 30 years and the jet stream the last
   three years has done stuff I've never seen," said Jeff Masters,
   meteorology director at the private service Weather Underground. "The
   fact that the jet stream is unusual could be an indicator of something.
   I'm not saying we know what it is."

   Rutgers' Francis is in the camp that thinks climate change is probably
   playing a role in this.

   "It's been just a crazy fall and winter and spring all along, following
   a very abnormal sea ice condition in the Arctic," Francis said, noting
   that last year set a record low for summer sea ice in the Arctic. "It's
   possible what we're seeing in this unusual weather is all connected."

   Other scientists don't make the sea ice and global warming connections
   that Francis does. They see random weather or long-term cycles at work.
   And even more scientists are taking a wait-and-see approach about this
   latest theory. It's far from a scientific consensus, but it is
   something that is being studied more often and getting a lot of
   scientific buzz.

   "There are some viable hypotheses," Stanford University climate
   scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said. "We're going to need more evidence to
   fully test those hypotheses."

   The jet stream, or more precisely the polar jet stream, is the one that
   affects the Northern Hemisphere. It dips down from Alaska, across the
   United States or Canada, then across the Atlantic and over Europe and
   "has everything to do with the weather we experience," Francis said.

   It all starts with the difference between cold temperatures in the
   Arctic and warmer temperatures in the mid-latitudes, she explained. The
   bigger the temperature difference, the stronger the jet stream, the
   faster it moves and the straighter it flows. But as the northern polar
   regions warm two to three times faster than the rest of the world,
   augmented by unprecedented melting of Arctic sea ice and loss in snow
   cover, the temperature difference shrinks. Then the jet stream slows
   and undulates more.

   The jet stream is about 14 percent slower in the fall now than in the
   1990s, according to a recent study by Francis. And when it slows, it
   moves north-south instead of east-west, bringing more unusual weather,
   creating blocking patterns and cutoff lows that are associated with
   weird weather, the Rutgers scientist said.

   Mike Halpert, the deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center,
   said that recently the jet stream seems to create weather patterns that
   get stuck, making dry spells into droughts and hot days into heat
   waves.

   Take the past two winters. They were as different as can be, but both
   had unusual jet stream activity. Normally, the jet stream plunges
   southwest from western Washington state, sloping across to Alabama.
   Then it curves slightly out to sea around the Outer Banks, a swoop
   that's generally straight without dramatic bends.

   During the mostly snowless winter of 2011-12 and the record warm March
   2012, the jet stream instead formed a giant upside-down U, curving
   dramatically in the opposite direction. That trapped warm air over much
   of the Eastern U.S. A year later the jet stream was again unusual, this
   time with a sharp U-turn north. This trapped colder and snowier weather
   in places like Chicago and caused nor'easters in New England, Francis
   said.

   But for true extremes, nothing beats tornadoes.

   In 2011, the United States was hit over and over by killer twisters.
   From June 2010 to May 2011 the U.S. had a record number of substantial
   tornadoes, totaling 1,050. Then just a year later came a record tornado
   drought. From May 2012 to April 2013 there were only 217 tornadoes --
   30 fewer than the old record, said Harold Brooks, a meteorologist at
   the National Severe Storms Laboratory. Brooks said both examples were
   related to unusual jet stream patterns.

   Last fall, a dip in the jet stream over the United States and northward
   bulge of high pressure combined to pull Superstorm Sandy almost due
   west into New Jersey, Francis said. That track is so rare and nearly
   unprecedented that computer models indicate it would happen only once
   every 714 years, according to a new study by NASA and Columbia
   University scientists.

   "Everyone would agree that we are in a pattern" of extremes, NOAA
   research meteorologist Martin Hoerling said. "We don't know how long it
   will stay in this pattern."
