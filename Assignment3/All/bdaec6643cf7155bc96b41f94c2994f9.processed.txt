How Should History Affect Funding Decisions?

   As I go through the reviews from my latest NSF proposal, there are
   general high-level comments related to my past work.  This leads to an
   interesting and perhaps-not-often-enough discussed issue -- how should
   the past influence present funding decisions?  Mikkel Thorup recently
   tried to open up discussion on this theme with a [7]viewpoint piece in
   the Communications of the ACM.   (Sorry it's behind a firewall;  if
   someone has a direct link please post in comments.)
   To be clear, I'm not sure what the current NSF policy is on "history",
   as I haven't served on an NSF panel for a while.  In the past I recall
   hearing that NSF panels were not supposed to take PI history into
   account in evaluating the proposals, although it seemed to be implied
   that the program manager would take that into consideration if needed.
   Another country I do reviews for does take history into account in an a
   fairly direct way -- there are explicit questions regarding whether the
   applicant has demonstrated the qualifications necessary to carry out
   the proposed research project.  That's a fairly broad phrasing, that at
   least in my mind opens the way to discussing the PIs past work.  So in
   that case there is some weight put on past performance.
   I admit that I think past performance is a perfectly reasonable
   criterion for judging funding proposals.  It helps to think of extreme
   cases.  For example, if Les Valiant wrote a proposal and I somehow was
   on the panel and didn't understand or appreciate it, history (and/or
   basic probability) would overwhelmingly suggest that the fault is with
   me.  Or even if one would assume or argue that the proposal wasn't well
   written, wouldn't the risk/reward calculation based on the track record
   argue strongly for funding?  At the other extreme, one must make sure
   that new faculty with limited track records obtain enough funding to
   have the chance to ignite, either through special programs (like CAREER
   grants) or with some understanding that new faculty should be given an
   appropriate share of the funding pie.
   In the end, my mindset is that there is a difference between writing a
   compelling sounding proposal and being able to deliver the research
   results.  Looking at a researcher's past helps calibrate what the final
   outcome will be.  Not taking it into account seems inherently wrong,
   under standard success metrics.  However, it's hard to assign a number
   as to how much it should affect the overall (and arguably quite
   subjective) scoring of proposals in any given panel that decides
   grants.  I don't envy people at the NSF the job of trying to untangle
   this messy situation, particularly in settings where they feel others
   (say, up in the direction of Congress) are out to second-guess their
   decisions.
   In terms of my current reviews, I thought the panel took into account
   my past history in mild and reasonable ways that I appreciated.
   Unsurprisingly my proposal dealt with problems at the intersection of
   algorithms, networking, and information theory, and I discussed that I
   had a (successful) history of interacting with all of these
   communities.  The reviewers acknowledged this history and noted that my
   background, including previous research in hashing, coding theory, and
   so on would likely be relevant to solving the problems I proposed.  I
   don't know how much it played into the final decision, but I was glad
   they agreed with the argument that I had the right background.  I
   should note, though, that in the past I've written proposals where I
   was trying to "branch out" into areas that were newer to me (they did
   not -- gasp -- involve hashing, or coding theory....), and I believe I
   experienced the same effect in reverse.  So there's certainly an
   argument the other way...
   The other way the past seemed to be taken into account was with regard
   to some of the "broader impacts".  This blog, for instance, seems to be
   seen as a "positive" in terms of community outreach.  Similarly, the
   fact that I have produced a body of educational materials over the
   years (class notes*, surveys, a textbook, assignments, etc.) was
   noted.  Again, I think history should be taken into account somehow
   here.  It's easy to say you're going to write a textbook or large-scale
   survey in a proposal, but it's another thing to have a record of
   delivering.
   How much should past performance count in reviewing proposals?  And can
   we actually influence the funding agencies to take past performance
   into account in ways we as a community find suitable?  I'm curious to
   see if people have thoughts they'll share in the comments.
   * I'm off teaching the Computer Science 124, Algorithms and Data
   Structures, now for sabbatical and potentially for a while.  If anyone
   teaching this wants my materials, though, let me know;  I've often
   passed them along to faculty starting to teach that type of course.

          I live in a country whose funding body takes recent history
          under consideration and allows for partial funding.
          My proposal which was well funded had the comment (paraphrasing)
          "project seems at first overly ambitious and broad but applicant
          has a record of delivering. rank: top category".
          This is a mini-version of your Les Valiant example above. It is
          meant to show that lower tiers can also benefit from looking at
          the historical record instead of focusing in grantsmithing
          alone.

          The NSF review criteria specifically include "4. How well
          qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct
          the proposed activities?", so your track record is an important
          consideration.
