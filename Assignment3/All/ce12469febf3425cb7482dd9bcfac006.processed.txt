         Facebook says governments demanded data on 38K users (Update)

   Facebook: Governments demanded data on 38K users [12]Enlarge

   Menlo Park, Calif. Government agents in 74 countries demanded
   information on about 38,000 Facebook users in the first half of this
   year, with about half the orders coming from authorities in the United
   States, the company said Tuesday. The social-networking giant is the

   Government agents in 74 countries demanded information on about 38,000
   Facebook users in the first half of this year, with about half the
   orders coming from authorities in the United States, the company said
   Tuesday.

   The social-networking giant is the latest technology company to release
   figures on how often governments seek information about its customers.
   Microsoft and Google have done the same.

   As with the other companies, it's hard to discern much from Facebook's
   data, besides the fact that, as users around the globe flocked to the
   world's largest social network, police and intelligence agencies
   followed.

   Facebook and Twitter have become organizing platforms for activists
   and, as such, have become targets for governments. During
   anti-government protests in Turkey in May and June, Turkish Prime
   Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called social media "the worst menace to
   society."

   At the time, Facebook denied it provided information about protest
   organizers to the Turkish government.

   Data released Tuesday show authorities in Turkey submitted 96 requests
   covering 173 users. Facebook said it provided some information in about
   45 of those cases, but there's no information on what was turned over
   and why.

   "We fight many of these requests, pushing back when we find legal
   deficiencies and narrowing the scope of overly broad or vague
   requests," Colin Stretch, Facebook's general counsel company said in a
   blog post. "When we are required to comply with a particular request,
   we frequently share only basic user information, such as name."

   Facebook spokeswoman Sarah Feinberg said the company stands by its
   assertions that it gave no information regarding the Turkey protests.

   "The data included in the report related to Turkey is about child
   endangerment and emergency law enforcement requests," she said.

   Facebook and other technology companies have been criticized for
   helping the National Security Agency secretly collect data on
   customers. Federal law gives government the authority to demand data
   without specific warrants, and while companies can fight requests in
   secret court hearings, it's an uphill battle.

   Facebook turned over some data in response to about 60 percent of those
   requests.

   It's not clear from the Facebook data how many of the roughly 26,000
   government requests on 38,000 users were for law-enforcement purposes
   and how many were for intelligence gathering.

   Technology and government officials have said criminal investigations
   are far more common than national security matters as a justification
   for demanding information from companies.

   The numbers are imprecise because the federal government forbids
   companies from revealing how many times they've been ordered to turn
   over information about their customers. Facebook released only a range
   of figures for the United States.

   The company said it planned to start releasing these figures regularly.
