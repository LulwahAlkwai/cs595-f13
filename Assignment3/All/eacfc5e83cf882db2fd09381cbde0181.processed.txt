Myhill Nerode versus Pumping Lemma

   I have seen some recent [5]backlash against the pumping lemma for
   showing that languages are not regular and as I am now teaching regular
   languages I had to choose should I teach the [6]pumping lemma or
   [7]Myhill-Nerode to show languages are not regular. Let's review both
   definitions (taken from Wikipedia)
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pumping Lemma: If a language L is regular, then there exists a number p
   >= 1 (the pumping length) such that every string uwv in L with |w| >= p
   can be written in the form uwv = uxyzv with strings x, y and z such
   that |xy| <= p, |y| >= 1 and uxy^izv is in L for every integer i >= 0.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Myhill-Nerode: Given a language L, and a pair of strings x and y,
   define a distinguishing extension to be a string z such that exactly
   one of the two strings xz and yz belongs to L. Define a relation R[L]
   on strings by the rule that x R[L] y if there is no distinguishing
   extension for x and y. It is easy to show that R[L] is an
   [8]equivalence relation on strings, and thus it divides the set of all
   finite strings into [9]equivalence classes.
   The Myhill-Nerode theorem states that L is regular if and only if R[L]
   has a finite number of equivalence classes, and moreover that the
   number of states in the smallest [10]deterministic finite automaton
   (DFA) recognizing L is equal to the number of equivalence classes in
   R[L]. In particular, this implies that there is a unique [11]minimal
   DFA with minimum number of states.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The two basic complaints about the pumping lemma: Five quantifiers and
   it is not complete--there are nonregular languages that can be pumped.
   To the first point if you think of the pumping lemma as a game with the
   adversary choosing p, x, y and z, the quantification is not as
   confusing as some would think. Myhill-Nerode also has five quantifiers
   when you spell it out: For all regular L, there exist x[1],...,x[k]
   such that for all y there is an i such that for all z, x[i]z is in L
   iff yz is in L.
   As to the second part, the counterexamples are contrived and usually go
   away with simple closure properties. Consider the one from wikipedia:
   [12][101345d833ff9a7a95f59dd7831a0e8b.png]
   Take L (U (01(2)U3))* eliminates the strings in the first part of L and
   now it is easy to pump.
   So I don't buy the arguments for Myhill-Nerode over pumping.
   Nevertheless I'll teach the pumping lemma and Myhill-Nerode because
   they are both so cool.

       The point of the pumping lemma version is that it is useful when
       you get to CFGs, and with some reservations to Multiple
       Context-Free Grammars.
       (See Makoto Kanazawa's recent work on pumping lemmas for MCFGs).

       Pumping is better pedagogically- it makes intuitive sense that its
       true
       and the Pumping Lemma for CFG's is a nice followup.
       Myhill-Nerode is more elegant and better mathematically.
       One should not confuse what is better pedagogically and what is
       better
       mathematically.

       I disagree about pedagogy if you aren't going to do the PL for
       CFGs. (I no longer have time for that, or for the use of closures
       to prove non-regularity). Proving the whole of Myhill-Nerode is
       overkill if you are comparing it to the PL. All you need to show is
       that if two strings are not equivalent under R_L then they must
       lead to different states in any DFA for L, which is trivial.
       The only tricky part of this is getting students to understand R_L
       but the notion is very intuitive: If you are building a DFA for L
       then you think operationally about what you need to remember about
       prefixes of the input in order to figure out whether the whole
       string ought to be accepted. R_L captures exactly that issue so it
       fits with their DFA design ideas.

       With Myhill-Nerode, you simply count the number of distinguishing
       extensions and you get the right answer. Usually, it is not hard to
       count this more or less exactly.
       To prove a language is irregular with the Pumping Lemma, you have
       to guess the correct original string to use. And there might not be
       any such string, because the Pumping Lemma isn't complete. I find
       this situation very confusing and frustrating.

       I find the communication complexity view of Myhill-Nerode much more
       intuitive: Alice gets a string x, Bob a string y, and the goal is
       to find out if xy is in L. L is regular iff the one-way
       communication complexity of this problem is finite, i.e., the
       communication matrix has only finitely many distinct rows. To see
       that a language like {a^nb^n: n in N} is not regular consider all
       rows labeled with a^i and columns labeled with b^j, and it is an
       infinitely sized identity matrix.

       Your formulation of the pumping lemma can be strengthened to u,v
       being the empty strings. Perhaps you're being confused by the
       Bar-Hillel pumping lemma?
       Regarding which one is better, students are often confused by the
       fact that the adversary gets to choose the partition xyz. So on the
       one hand, if they do understand it then their mathematical level
       has increased. On the other hand, they usually don't get it. I
       haven't had the opportunity to compare the pumping lemma to
       Myhill-Nerode, so I can't say whether the latter is better, but I
       find it completely backwards that the simpler Myhill-Nerode
       criterion is not taught while the more complicated pumping lemma
       "test" is taught. I would go *first* for Myhill-Nerode, which I
       feel is more natural.

       I teach finite automata and regular languages in two different
       courses. In the discrete math course, it comes at the end and I do
       only Myhill-Nerode. For the Sipser-book course, it comes at the
       beginning and I do both. (It's nice that Sipser 2e and 3e have M-N
       as a worked exercise.)
       In the discrete math course I'm doing this material to show that
       the techniques we've learned all term can solve actual mathematical
       problems related to computation. M-N gives more intuition about
       regular languages, and helps in mnimizing DFA's which the students
       like.
       In the Sipser course I'm in more of a hurry and the FA material is
       review for many of them. I am going to do the CFL Pumping Lemma
       later in that course, so I want to do the regular language PL to
       have as a base for that. But as Lance says, they are both so cool,
       so I do M-N. I would rather have them use M-N for non-regularity
       proofs because they strike me as far more intuitive: the intuition
       that "you have to remember how many a's you've seen because if you
       don't know you are screwed if you get a particular number of b's"
       is really almost an M-N proof as it stands.
       Anonymous makes a good point about communication complexity. I
       would not be surprised if in the future everyone does communication
       complexity in undergrad courses. Does anyone do that now, or want
       to argue that we should or shouldn't?

       I never understood on which grounds people claim that doing games
       with adversaries and the likes is "more intuitive" than
       quantification. It is quite clear that quantification is much more
       elegant and transparent than games.
