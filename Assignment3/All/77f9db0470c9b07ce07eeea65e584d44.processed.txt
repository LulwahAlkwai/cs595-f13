   [63]Class of 1972, [64]digital learning

   Three thousand have climbed Mount Everest; there've been about 500
   astronauts; but fewer than 50 have ever sailed solo, nonstop, around
   the world. Rich Wilson '72, M.B.A. '82, is one of them. In 121 days
   spanning late 2008 and early 2009, Wilson competed in what he calls
   "the world's greatest sailing race," the quadrennial Vendée Globe. It
   begins and ends in Les Sables d'Olonne, a coastal town in the Vendée
   department of western France. Its route takes the intrepid skippers
   through the treacherous southern waters around the Cape of Good Hope,
   south of Australia, and around Cape Horn. Beyond that, you're free to
   improvise: the directions aren't much more specific than the title of
   Wilson's 2012 book on his experience, [65]Race France to France, Leave
   Antarctica to Starboard. Of the 30 who set sail in 2008, he placed
   ninth among the 11 finishers in the exhausting, nearly unbelievable
   test of endurance, seamanship, and character. He was the oldest skipper
   (at 58), the only American, and the only asthmatic--he takes four drugs
   a day to control symptoms.

   Wilson wasn't racing just for thrills. He's a former Boston high-school
   math teacher who puzzled over the question of how to get kids to pay
   attention and engage with the learning process. His guiding purpose for
   the race was connecting his circumnavigation to sitesALIVE!
   ([66]www.sitesalive.com), the nonprofit educational foundation he
   launched to connect schoolchildren worldwide with adventures and
   expeditions as they unfold in real time. "Once you've hooked the kids
   with excitement," he says, "you can feed them whatever content you
   want--math, science, nutrition, biology, astronomy, teamwork,
   perseverance, goal-setting." At the start of the Vendée Globe, he had
   25 newspapers under contract to publish his dispatches as the race
   progressed; they reached seven million readers, plus 250,000 K-12
   students in classrooms who could communicate with him, and each other,
   online. "If you could get a kid in Beijing talking to a kid in Bogotá,
   who is talking to a kid in Boston," he says, "now, that would be cool."

   There was much to talk about. Wilson's 60-foot boat, the Great American
   III, built in 2000, was two shipbuilding generations older than the
   competing state-of-the-art vessels. Still, it was loaded with
   electronics, desalinization equipment, and solar panels, and had 51
   control lines running to the cockpit. He was provisioned to eat four
   meals--6,000 calories--daily to fuel the nearly constant exertion that
   single-handed sailing demands (even so, he lost four pounds during the
   race).

   Yet nothing could prepare Wilson for the huge storm that hit the racers
   in the Atlantic, two days out. Fifty knots of wind and high, unruly
   seas battered the fleet: "There was carnage, chaos, and three skippers
   suffered broken masts and had to withdraw from the race," he reports. A
   huge uppercut wave slammed the Great American III and threw Wilson six
   feet through the air against a stainless-steel grab bar; the impact
   jackknifed him and broke two ribs. That was only one of the trials on
   the 28,790-nautical-mile race; another was ascending 65 feet of the
   90-foot mast for a repair ("The single most fearful thing is going
   aloft"). Sleep deprivation was extraordinary (he averaged only four to
   five hours of sleep per day), and "there's an exponential, accumulated
   fatigue curve for both boat and skipper," he says. (He once slept
   through his 120-decibel Sonic Boom alarm clock.)

   Yet there were rewards: a Frenchwoman sewed a dress made of U.S. flags
   to wear for Wilson's arrival, and at the prize-giving ceremony, the
   120,000 sailing fans present heard his speech in fluent French. A taxi
   driver even asked for his autograph at the Charles de Gaulle Airport--a
   real surprise, for, as he explains, "when I'm at home in Marblehead, no
   one knows who I am."
