The Recruiter's Tale

   In a [25]recent column, I asked the question, "Who is driving the
   online locomotive?"--in other words, who exactly is pushing the idea of
   offering more and more (not to mention bigger and bigger) online
   classes? Because that's certainly where higher education seems to be
   headed.

   I concluded that the people who hire college graduates are not among
   the culprits, citing a recent Chronicle survey in which prospective
   employers reported positive impressions of all types of
   higher-education institutions--except for online colleges. Of course,
   as I noted (and as several readers pointed out), there's a big
   difference between getting an entire degree online and taking a few
   online courses en route to getting a degree. But employers' general
   lack of regard for computer college suggests that they find the
   online-learning environment a bit suspect.

   Not long after that column was published, I had a conversation with a
   good friend of mine that reinforced my perception of employers'
   attitudes toward online classes.

   My friend is a partner in a large, multinational professional-services
   firm. I wish I could say more, but even though he gave me permission to
   quote him in this post, he really doesn't want to be identified.
   Suffice it to say that his firm is one of the best known in its
   industry, with a client list that includes many of the world's most
   recognizable brands.

   One of my friend's duties, as a partner, is to serve as the primary
   recruiting and hiring manager for the regional office where he works.
   In that capacity he frequently visits college campuses, coordinates
   with human-resources folks at corporate headquarters, and interacts
   with his counterparts at other firms. So even though some might dismiss
   his thoughts as merely "one person's opinion," I'm convinced that this
   particular person knows what he's talking about--that he speaks not
   just for himself, and not just for his firm, but for a large and
   lucrative profession.

   What he said to me, after I told him about my column and some of the
   responses to it, was, "Oh, we would never hire somebody who took online
   classes."

   Never? Really?

   "Well," he admitted grudgingly, "I suppose a few online classes
   wouldn't necessarily be a deal-breaker. But if someone has a degree
   from an online college, or we can tell from their transcript that they
   took a lot of their classes online, we wouldn't consider them. I think
   that's pretty much true for any of the big firms in our industry."

   Think about that statement, just for a moment, in light of Jeb Bush's
   recent prediction that, by 2018, more than 80 percent of professional
   degrees will be earned online.

   When I asked my friend why companies like his aren't interested in
   people who took "a lot" of classes online, he explained, "The biggest
   problem with most of our new hires is that they already think
   everything can be done electronically. They're always on their
   computers and handheld devices, e-mailing or texting clients and
   colleagues. As their supervisor, I'm constantly having to remind them
   that our business is based on personal relationships. I literally have
   to tell them to get out from behind their computers and go talk to
   people. That concept is largely foreign to them."

   He concluded, "I'm sure online classes are fine for teaching certain
   specific concepts. But that's not really what we're interested in. We
   can teach those concepts ourselves. What we really value in a college
   education is the interpersonal skills that students develop while
   they're in school. Online classes just don't teach those."
