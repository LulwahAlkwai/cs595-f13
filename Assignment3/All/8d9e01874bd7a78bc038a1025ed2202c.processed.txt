   Kevin Hines paced along the Golden Gate Bridge, trying to figure out
   whether to obey the voices in his head urging him to jump. Anyone
   paying the slightest attention to Hines should've seen that something
   was horribly wrong. Sure enough, after about a half-hour, a woman
   approached him. Hines thought she was there to save his life.

   Instead, she was a tourist wanting Hines to take her picture. The look
   of desperation on his face apparently didn't register. Elation crumpled
   into despair. "Nobody cares," he thought. "Absolutely nobody cares."

   Hines soon hurdled a railing, stepped out onto a ledge 25 stories above
   San Francisco Bay and jumped. He immediately regretted it. Falling 75
   miles an hour headfirst toward the water, Hines realized that if he was
   going to save himself, he had to hit feet first. So he threw his head
   back right before he plunged 80 feet into the cold waters, shattering
   two of his lower vertebrae. He eventually surfaced and was rescued by
   the Coast Guard. Only one out of 50 who jump survive.

   Thirteen years removed from his attempt, Hines is now an author and
   lecturer, and doing quite well considering his experience. Hines
   frequently travels around the country talking about what happened on
   September 25, 2000. Diagnosed with [64]bipolar disorder, he still has
   auditory and visual hallucinations as well as paranoid delusions. But
   today, he has a support network of family and friends that check up on
   him and identify early warning signs that could lead to Hines harming
   himself again. He logs his symptoms into an online document he shares
   with others so they can keep an eye on him. Hines says that's what
   separates him from so many others who have suicidal thoughts.

   "When you learn to be self-aware with mental illness, you can save your
   own life," Hines says.

   In May, the Centers for Disease Control released data showing that in
   2010, 38,364 people weren't able to save themselves. For the first
   time, the number of suicides surpassed deaths from motor vehicle
   accidents and most researchers believe that number is low, if anything,
   because many suicides go unreported. The suicide rate for Americans
   aged 35 to 64 rose 28.4 percent from 1999 to 2010. According to the
   CDC, $35 billion is lost due to medical bills and work loss costs
   related to suicide each year. And while suicide rates are not as high
   as they were in the early 1990s, they've climbed steadily upward since
   2005.

   As more Americans commit suicide, some in the field question the
   effectiveness of current prevention programs. Over the last 15 years,
   public policy and federal funding have shifted toward a broader mental
   wellness movement aimed at helping people deal with anxiety and
   [65]depression that could eventually lead to suicidality. But that
   shift may have left those most at-risk of suicide, like Hines, without
   the support they need.

   One program sits at the intersection of those two approaches. The
   National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which expects 1.1 million to 1.2
   million calls this year and receives about 15 percent more callers each
   year, is broadly marketed to the general public through billboards and
   ads that reach those suffering from anxiety, depression and loneliness
   but are often not actively suicidal. At the same time, it's an
   emergency resource for those who are at immediate risk of killing
   themselves and who struggle with chronic mental illness. But some in
   the field question its effectiveness, along with the effectiveness of
   many other services and programs funded and promoted on a national
   scale. Those in the field often use the metaphor of a river to
   illustrate the divide: Is it worth getting to more people upstream or
   narrowly targeting those like Hines downstream?

   At the Waterfall

   The bridge phone inside [66]New York City's suicide prevention call
   center only rings about once a month. But when it does, often in the
   middle of the night, it emits distinct, deep chirps - as if the phone
   itself is in distress. The operators manning the 24/7 LifeNet hotline
   recognize the ring immediately. It means someone's calling from one of
   the area's 11 bridges, and they're likely thinking about jumping.

   LifeNet, a mental health and suicide prevention hotline servicing New
   York's metropolitan area, is located in the H2H Connect Crisis Contact
   Center, which serves as one of 161 call centers that make up the
   National Suicide Prevention Lifeline network, headquartered in the same
   building. During its busiest hours from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., the hotline
   has roughly 20 operators working the phones inside their unassuming
   L-shaped office space in lower Manhattan. The operators could easily be
   mistaken for a collection of telemarketers. The large computer screen
   at the head of the call center showing the number of lines being
   processed could easily reside inside QVC's customer service center.

   Record High)

   You don't get a sense of what truly happens in this room until you run
   across the bridge phone, which is a direct line to the call center.
   It's LifeNet's equivalent of the Oval Office's mythical red phone. On
   the wall above it, black Ikea picture frames display detailed
   information for each bridge and the locations of its call boxes:
   "Northbound 3^rd Avenue Exit," "Westbound Light Pole 60." If someone
   calls, they can use the caller ID, check the information above the
   phone and immediately locate the caller and send help.

   If it were up to those who work at LifeNet, however, they would get rid
   of the bridge phone altogether. "What we want is to get people
   upstream," says John Draper, director of the National Suicide
   Prevention Lifeline. "We don't necessarily want to get people who are
   on the edge of the waterfall. If they are, we can help them. But it's a
   huge cost savings for the entire mental health system if you can get
   people further upstream."

   Josh - you do a disservice to Kevin Hines by calling him an author but
   failing to mention the book he is actively promoting - the one book he
   has published.  The book he wrote to tell his personal story and to
   help others who may be dealing with a mental disorder.   Kevin's book
   is titled Cracked, Not Broken: Surviving and Thriving After a Suicide
   Attempt.

   This is an important and poignant piece. Please know that anyone in
   distress can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at
   800-273-TALK (8255) anytime, anywhere. It is free and confidential.

   Sequester  will affect not only the FBI. One of the main reasons for
   the increase of suicides - is the deterioration in the quality of life,
   loss of confidence in the future. Foreign policy of USA should  to
   focus on diplomacy in full accordance with international law. If the
   United States will be concentrated in the field of foreign policy on
   diplomacy in full accordance with international law - it will allow to
   save considerable funds for solving internal problems and then, despite
   all the trials, will confidence in tomorrow. Americans should be
   confident that their children and grandchildren will live better than
   their parents - it will become a powerful stimulus to overcome the
   difficulties.

   My first thought is the Hotline number should be in the headline.
   I think both upstream and immediate aid are required. The current HIPAA
   policies are also somewhat of a problem. Confidentiality in therapy and
   treatment is extremely important. The problem steps in with
   medications. Some of these produce behavior changes and suicidal
   behaviors, especially at the start or when a drug just isn't the
   "right" one. My therapy includes both psychologist, a NIPA
   (Psychiatrist) for drug treatment short visits. How well does she/he
   know my my progress is.  My psychologist cannot prescribe medications
   and my doctor often dismisses real illnesses to "hypochondria" from
   anxiety.  It would be so helpful if people were required to have a
   "medication partner" someone who could note the side effects I
   sometimes didn't even realize I had. One medication made my raging
   angry, no one knew it was from my meds. no one could help me until my
   Psychiatrist realized I needed to get off them. How much better for my
   family it would have been if someone close to me like my wife
   understood and knew what I was taking. And now I'm on a waiting list to
   see my therapist. Not going well. And even sometimes, especially when
   older, the thoughts appear to be very, very rational. My emotions go
   too numb most days now.

   The real solution to suicide is a basic reasoning! Anyone reading this
   thinking suicidal thoughts just remember these things:

   1. You are capable of rational thought.

   2. Focus on rational thoughts rather than emotions, because clearly
   your emotions are betraying you.

   3. If for some reason life is pointless (which I doubt is the
   conclusion you will come to if you follow #2), then there is also no
   reason to kill oneself.

   4. If for some reason #1-3 still leave you with suicidal thoughts, then
   please do call a suicide hotline. You are obviously on the internet, so
   you have the ability to reach these resources.

   Well the public medical costs of suicide (presumably mostly the
   unsuccessful attempts) are of some concern, but what must really worry
   us are what are described here as the "lost work" costs. Just think how
   many hours at minimum wage we might have gained from those poor souls
   whom we could have saved and maintained as wage slaves ... until, of
   course, they die anyway.

   Very disturbing news...
   In the United States may "festival of disobedience" for the bandits.
   The FBI just goes on holiday.

   Reduction of expenses of the budget of USA can force the Federal Bureau
   of investigation to suspend its work during the fiscal year 2013/2014.
   According to sources, the Bloomberg Agency, the FBI evaluate all the
   options and continue to fight for funding" on the threshold of 1
   October, when the United States will begin a new fiscal year and the
   effect of automatic spending cuts. In early September the post of
   Director of the FBI took James Comey. His predecessor Robert Mueller
   said the spending cuts will be one of the most complex problems, with
   which will face the new head of the FBI. James Comey said: "I was very
   surprised to learn about the impacts that sequestration is having on
   the FBI," Comey said. "Not only am I having to lose 3,000 positions,
   but there's a very real prospect, unless something is done, that I'm
   going to have to send home, for two weeks without pay, the good men and
   women who work in this building behind
   me."[79]http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/fbi-sequestration-impa

   Suicide survivor here.  Most recent 2010.  The day my home was
   auctioned in foreclosure.  Turned myself into VA.  They bkept me locked
   up for three days.  Never once asked what led me to the attempt.  VA
   totally failed me, not once twice.  I knew I was in trouble, they
   ignored my requests.

   Call the VA now and they will say (You screwed up again, call a
   different number) call the Suicide hotline for help.  When you are
   seeking help as a last resort the chances that you have paper and
   pencil handy is slim.

   Yes the thought of suicide is an everyday event.  No family,no friends
   close by, no support.

   Severe depression sends a person downward. It is a sad, lonely and
   devastating feeling. A person feels hopeless and despair. My parents
   were both depressed and had 4 depressed children. In different ways we
   survived it for a time. By Gods good grace. Always know even in the
   depths of depression you will come out OK. It is work and slow. You
   will move forward in a better place. Much more is known about mental
   disorders than in the 50s,60s,70s,80's,90's and 2000+. My parents and 1
   brother are gone. 5 yrs. ago my younger brother survived an attempt and
   lives in a group home. My sister and I work at staying well. Our
   children struggle with depression but not to the degree we did.
   Knowledge & medical advances move us forward. 211 info line will direct
   you to help

   @Cap'tNemo as a vietnam vet i have had those thoughts too, years ago i
   understand the feeling and had to fight the urge many times. If family
   is not close by and you feel you have no friends or any real support,
   then go out and rescue a Dog or cat at a shelter you will then have
   something that will love you with no conditions attached and that will
   need you as much as you it. Pick one that matches your personality and
   give it love it will love you back and i assure you you will feel
   better. Do what i tell you it will save your life and your pets life.

   @Cap'tNemo Please stay safe. If you're having suicidal thoughts, you
   can call 1-800-273-TALK. It's available 24/7.

   @Cap'tNemoPlease don't harm yourself sir. I know you feel all alone and
   nothing will help, but I promise things can change. Move far, far away.
   Just up  and leave your current life and go start a new one. If things
   are bad, try to change. If that doesn't work, please seek help.
