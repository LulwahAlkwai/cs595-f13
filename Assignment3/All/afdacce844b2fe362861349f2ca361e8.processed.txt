[120]This Insect Has Gears In Its Legs

   by Ed Yong

   The image above is an extreme close-up of a common British insect
   called a planthopper. You're looking at it from below, at the point
   where its two hind legs connect to its body. In the middle, you can
   clearly see that the top of each leg has a row of small teeth, which
   interlock together. As the planthopper jumps, the teeth ensure that its
   legs rotate together and extend at the same time.

   This insect has gears.

   GEARS!

   It's a steampunk bug!

   IFRAME: [121]//www.youtube.com/embed/cq0Mf2pt2XA

   The gears are found on many young planthoppers but Gregory Sutton from
   the University of Cambridge first discovered them on a common British
   species called Issus coeleoptratus. "We didn't have to go to some
   obscure monastery in Outer Slaubvinia to find these things," he says.
   "We had to go to a place called The Garden, in The Backyard. Either the
   most complicated gearing in nature happens to be in our backyard, or
   there is stuff that's vastly more intricate and complicated that hasn't
   been found yet."

   Sutton has been working with [123]Malcolm Burrows from the University
   of Cambridge for the last 10 years, to study the movements of jumping
   insects like [124]fleas, locusts, leafhoppers and [125]pygmy mole
   crickets. When they filmed young planthoppers taking off, they saw that
   the hind legs would always move within 30 microseconds (millionths of a
   second) of each other. Such extreme coordination makes sense--the
   slightest difference in timing would send the insects spinning off to
   the side. But how could they achieve such tightly synchronised
   movements?

   The nervous system can't be involved. In 30 microseconds, a neuron can
   barely begin to fire, much less trigger something that tweaks the
   insect's movements.

   The answer lies on the insect's undersides. Back in the 1950s, other
   scientists noted that young planthoppers have small bumps on their
   trochanters--the first segment of the legs, which connect to the
   hip-like coxa. They were only found on the hind legs, and not the other
   pairs. No one knew what they were for. No one seemed to care. "It was
   one of those odd little footnotes in anatomical books," says Sutton.

   Burrows and Sutton discovered the function of the bumps by planthoppers
   that had been restrained on their backs. The insects would try to jump
   whenever the duo gently prodded their abdomens. Just before their legs
   shot out, their trochanters would squeeze together. The bumps engaged
   and rolled against each other, exactly like man-made gears. "I was
   gobsmacked," says Sutton.

   Gears allow two machines to rotate together in opposite directions.
   That's exactly what the planthopper's trochanter bumps do. Sutton
   tested this by pulling on the tendons of its jumping muscles with some
   forceps ("It's the Serious Edition of [127]Operation", he says.). Even
   if he only pulled one tendon, both legs would extend because the gears
   transmitted the motion of one trochanter into the other.

   "Then, we got really lucky because we saw a few jumps where the gears
   wouldn't engage perfectly," says Sutton. When this happened, one leg
   was partially extended before the gears finally snagged and the
   planthopper's nigh-perfect coordination was ruined.

   Wait! It gets better. These gears are training wheels!

   The planthopper nymphs lose them when they become adults. But the
   adults don't shoot off in uncoordinated spins--if anything, they're
   better jumpers than the youngsters. Their hind trochanters make much
   closer contact with each other, and Sutton thinks that [128]the
   friction between them helps to keep them in time. "We're kind of sure
   about that, but not entirely sure," he says.

   "This is to our knowledge the first time that proper, engaging,
   counter-rotating gears have been seen in the animal kingdom," says
   Sutton. Crocodiles have cog-like teeth [129]in their heart valves, and
   the [130]wheel bug and cog-wheel turtle have teeth on their shells. But
   none of these structures actually act like gears. "You never see one
   cog-wheel turtle sidle up next to another, engage their shells, and
   spin in opposite directions," says Sutton. "If you did, I want you to
   call me. If I see that on your website, and I haven't been called, I
   will be an angry man."

   The discovery is astounding in itself, but Sutton--a mechanical
   engineer--thinks that they could help us to make more effective
   machines at incredibly small scales. The teeth of most modern gears
   harken back to the 18^th century, when mathematician Leonhard Euler
   designed a shape that could be easily cut by a machine. It's called an
   involute and it looks like a hill with a plateau at the top. It has
   been a standard part of gears ever since.

   But the planthopper's gear teeth look more like a shark fin. "What we
   have is a prototype for a tooth shape for a high-speed, one-directional
   gear that's not constrained by the machining techniques of the 18th
   century," says Sutton.

   Modern machines, such as 3-D printers, could easily create gears with
   these shark-fin teeth. Sutton is really excited by the prospect, and
   suspects that they may perform better in very small machines. "Modern
   machinery often doesn't work at very small scales," he says. "Friction
   doesn't matter so much when you have two big gears next to each other
   but when you get small, friction starts killing you."

   The planthoppers might help to solve that problem. "We're still being
   impressed and shocked by what we find in the back garden," says Sutton.

       The shape of the gear teeth is called wolf's tooth, and has
       occasionally been used in very high end watch movements (very old
       ones, too); most recently by the brothers McGonigle and a few Swiss
       brands. It's a variant form of cycloidal gearing. Trickier to make
       than the typical form, obviously, but the power transfer is
       cleaner. They're also really really pretty. :)

       I could be mistaken but it seems like many neat things found like
       this will end up on a robot in the very near future. I saw a study
       on cats and the mechanics of how they do everything a new discovery
       about how they drank was made, they do not lap but create a
       negative pressure and use their tongue more like a straw than for
       lapping as a dog does. Anyways the study was to advance robotics. I
       am sure that studying many animals will help to advance this area
       of toy making.

       Outer Slaubvinia? Good to see racism is alive and well in Merry
       Olde England.

       I do not know if that is racism, really, but you could make the
       claim it is trivialising names that sound foreign to English ears,
       in this case...maybe Central or Eastern European country names
       (like Slovenia)? Anyway, it does not seem to be malicious since it
       was done to humorously make a point about the availability of the
       insects (and by extension, any such fascinating biological
       phenomena) to the average researcher.

       Although planthoppers (or rather, the evolutionary processes that
       resulted in their interesting adaptation) are clearly the stars in
       this article, let's also give a hand to a scientist's sense of
       humour ("If I see that on your website, and I haven't been called,
       I will be an angry man") and the people who made the modern
       electron micrograph possible.
