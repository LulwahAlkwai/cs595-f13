Fight SOPA/PIPA: Tweet At Senate Leadership

   The Senate is threatening to pass its version of the Internet
   censorship bill -- the PROTECT IP Act -- when it returns from winter
   break later this month.  Will you tweet at Senate leadership to ask
   them to kill the legislation?  Just click here:

   leadership.


   Millions of Americans have emailed their own senators to ask them to
   oppose the legislation -- which is a big part of why we've been able to
   hold the bill up this long.

   But some members of the Senate are more powerful than others, and we
   need to let Senate leadership -- Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer, and Mitch
   McConnell -- know how upset we are that this legislation is on their
   agenda.  They have the power to block a vote from happening.

   We need to make them understand that hundreds of thousands of us are
   paying attention and will be looking to this issue when we decide whom
   to vote for in this year's elections.

   Normally we'd ask you to email them, but Senate offices block emails
   from people with out-of-state zip codes, so we're asking you to tweet
   at them instead.

   You can use this link to generate a tweet to those three Senators --
   you can use the language we've included, or modify it:
