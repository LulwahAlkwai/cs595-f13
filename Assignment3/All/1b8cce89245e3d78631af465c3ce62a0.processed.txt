T. Rex Might be the Thing with Feathers

Behind every famous dinosaur are unsung heroes.

   n 1858, a collection of large bones was found in a field in
   southeastern New Jersey. Today the site is lost within the unremarkable
   sprawl of suburban residences, and there is an easy-to-miss plaque that
   commemorates a 78-million-year-old Cretaceous herbivore called the
   Hadrosaurus foulkii. Unless you're a hardcore dinosaur aficionado or a
   paleontologist by profession, most likely you have never heard of the
   Hadrosaurus, but this dinosaur is more significant to science than the
   immediately recognizable Tyrannosaurus rex.

   The way we imagine dinosaurs has evolved over the three centuries since
   their discovery. It's an evolution characterized by the forces of fame,
   for the animals that rivet the public's imagination are not the ones
   that yield the most interesting information about ancient biology.
   Stars such as T. rex, Stegosaurus, and the Triceratops bask in the
   glory of public attention while little known dinosaurs such as
   Hadrosaurus, Deinonychus, Maiasaurua and other unsung species do the
   heavy lifting of scientific revelation.

   The injustice of fame is a common trope in science, but the history of
   paleontology provides a particularly vivid example, for it is an
   unusually harsh jury that decides which dinosaurs get memorialized in
   popular culture. Fond memories of museum trips and sandbox battles
   between plastic effigies of dinosaurian champions linger long past the
   "dinosaur phase" of many children. Even as scientists try to retire the
   "Brontosaurus" from the canon--because 19th-century confusion resulted
   in too many dinosaurs named from too few bones--it is still beloved by
   many, a sign of how hard it is to shake the public's devotion to these
   creatures.

   That devotion stretches back to the 18th century, when European
   naturalists recognized the curious bones found in mining pits and
   countryside rock outcrops as the clues to a past that predated humans.
   The first guesses as to the size and shape of the owners of these bones
   conjured up visions of creatures both stupendous and preposterous.

   Dinosaurs were first imagined as relatives of fire-breathing dragons,
   then as the ancestors of lizards who swept their gigantic tails as they
   slithered along the ground. They were also portrayed as slothful
   crocodiles that spent the days in the sun trying to move the needle on
   their naturally cold-blooded body temperature. As more fossils were
   discovered over the course of next two centuries, new light was shed on
   the dimensions of these creatures, as well as the texture of their
   outer coat (scaly, armored, or even fuzzy), whether they were
   meat-eaters or plant-munchers, their reproductive habits, whether they
   lived in packs or alone, and why some went extinct and others evolved
   into birds.

   In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several dinosaurs, including
   T. rex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and a handful of others, emerged as
   the celebrity faces of all the species. And while these stars are fixed
   in the public eye, they are not immutable. How we imagine them is
   periodically updated and revised thanks to the ongoing paleontological
   finds that continue to reveal new species. They are paraded around at
   conferences, receive long Latinate names, and even get their 15 minutes
   of fame in media headlines. But many dinosaur species fail to exert any
   real staying power on the public imagination and pass into obscurity
   while the valuable information they provide serves to refine and deepen
   our knowledge of all dinosaur species. We take information gleaned from
   newly discovered species and slap it back on dinosaurs we know and
   cherish. It's a boon to the brand name dinosaurs that receive regular
   makeovers that help them stay relevant.

     Stars such as T. rex, Stegosaurus, and the Triceratops bask in the
     glory of public attention while little known dinosaurs do the heavy
     lifting of scientific revelation.

   Such is the trajectory of Tyrannosaurus rex, literally the "King of the
   Tyrant Lizards," which was first described on the basis of an
   incomplete specimen found in Montana in the early 20th century. Henry
   Fairfield Osborn, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History
   (AMNH), named the massive carnivore in 1905. The following year, the
   museum began to construct the mounted skeleton that still draws
   visitors to the fourth floor exhibits. When only the legs of the
   enormous theropod were erected, The New York Times proclaimed T. rex
   the "prize-fighter of antiquity," and wrote that the hundreds of
   thousands of schoolchildren who poured into the museum would now have
   "a larger outlook into the future of a world that has such a past." T.
   rex became a bridge to the past.

   And the reign of T. rex has continued unabated. In 1937, the doors of
   the Dinosaur Park in Rapid City, South Dakota were opened as part of a
   New Deal initiative. An 80-foot plastic model that took 14 men 15
   months to construct looked down on tens of thousands of visitors just
   in the first year. Today the park sees upwards of 120,000 per year. In
   an article about the park's opening, The New York Times ran pictures of
   the star dinosaurs that were on display, showing a striking difference
   to how we see them today and underscoring how much our image of the
   dinosaur evolved in the past seven decades.

   But even with two relatively complete skeletons collected for the AMNH
   by professional fossil hunter Barnum Brown, the details of what T. rex
   was truly like eluded experts. Contributions from the British anatomist
   Richard Owen (who coined the term "dinosaur" in 1842) established a set
   of characteristics that differed drastically from those that had come
   before. Naturalists had previously compared the bits of broken jaw or
   teeth and noted their close match to those of crocodiles. A 1 to 1
   proportion ratio from the teeth to the body projected an impressively
   large lizard of more than 100 feet who dragged its enormous torso along
   the ground. Owen revised the image of the giant lizard and cut the size
   of dinosaur down to about 40 feet long. He envisioned a creature that
   had the hide of scaly reptiles but an upright posture like that of a
   rhinoceros or an elephant. But even Owen's conception of dinosaurian
   nature was not to last.

   It was displaced by the discovery of Hadrosaurus, that little-feted New
   Jersey native. This creature was significant because, unlike dinosaur
   specimens found in Europe, the recovered bits of backbone, limbs, hip,
   and skull came from a single individual. With the full skeleton,
   experts were able to see that the forelimbs of the dinosaur were
   significantly shorter than the hind limbs. So instead of resembling a
   giant crocodile, scientists understood that dinosaurs must have stood
   up, balancing on their hind limbs.

     Owen revised the image of the giant lizard and cut the size of
     dinosaur down to about 40 feet long.

   The Philadelphia naturalist and polymath Joseph Leidy, who named the
   Hadrosaurus, noted that, "this great herbivorous Lizard sustained
   itself in a semi-erect position... while it browsed on plants." To
   Leidy, Hadrosaurus was less a reptilian rhino and more like a
   kangaroo., The image of the dinosaur became that of an active creature
   who stood upright instead of slithering on the ground. The skeleton of
   the Hadrosaurus helped to create a more up-to-date model of the
   dinosaurs. The English artist and sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins
   constructed a version for Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences
   that stood about 30 feet in length.

   Just as the Hadrosaurus helped establish a dinosaur posture different
   from what naturalists had previously suspected, another little-known
   species helped scientists determine whether dinosaurs were warm- or
   cold-blooded.  The 19th-century comparison of dinosaurs to iguanas and
   crocodiles led naturalists to assume that they were cold-blooded
   creatures. However, in the late 19th century, the discovery of an agile
   raptor, Laelaps anquilunguis, later renamed the Dryptosaurus, showed a
   dinosaur that was a ripping, tearing predator who moved about swiftly
   on two legs. The agility of this carnivore strengthened the argument
   for warm-blooded dinosaurs. It also planted the idea that not all
   dinosaurs went extinct and that some may have evolved into birds.

   The discovery of another fossil--a whole a century later--sparked the
   idea that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. The 11-foot long,
   switchblade-clawed Deinonychus antirrhopus, named in 1969, was pieced
   together from the bones of multiple individuals found in a Montana
   quarry along with a beaked herbivore that seemed to have been
   slaughtered. Based on their being found together, Yale paleontologist
   John Ostrom speculated that Deinonychus was a pack hunter that slashed
   at victims with swift motions of a frightening foot claw. Disemboweling
   looked to be his preferred mode of dispatch. In his description of
   Deinonychus, Ostrom emphasized the animal's fierceness. "When all these
   features are considered together," Ostrom wrote, "we have a rather
   convincing picture, I think, of Deinonychus as an active and very agile
   predator." There was little doubt at that point that the dinosaur's
   rate of metabolism was high. And as Ostrom continued his
   investigations, he realized that the formidable Deinonychus resembled a
   larger version of another animal--the first bird, Archaeopteryx.
   Dinosaurs, Ostrom proposed, did not go totally extinct. If birds
   evolved from dinosaurs like Deinonychus, then dinosaurs survived.

   The discovery of the Deinonychus helped spur the "Dinosaur Renaissance"
   of the 1970s and '80s. Dinosaurs suddenly became a subject of
   respectable scientific interest again and the new facts trickled back
   to revise the public's image of the celebrity creatures. In Steven
   Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, famous dinosaurs vividly
   flaunt their newly acquired characteristics. The Brachiosaurus stopped
   sunning in the Jurassic mornings to warm up and became a proud
   herbivore that strutted over floodplains to show off its elegant neck.
   Tyrannosauraus became a super-charged predator that terrified
   audiences. Large, hulking reptiles were replaced by active, bird-like
   animals that were far more complex than believed earlier.

     Dinosaurs, Ostrom proposed, did not go totally extinct. If birds
     evolved from dinosaurs like Deinonychus, then dinosaurs survived.

   Part of the complexity lay in dinosaurs' family structure. Before the
   Dinosaur Renaissance researchers believed that dinosaur parents
   provided almost no care at all to their offspring. Another fossil find
   in 1979 in Montana challenged that narrative, spurring paleontologists
   Jack Horner and Robert Makela to discover entire nesting grounds where
   there were bones of adults as well as hatchlings. They concluded that
   at least one parent must have been looking after the babies and
   bringing food for them to eat and that the young were staying within
   the nest for some time after hatching. Researchers could no longer just
   assume that dinosaurs laid eggs and walked away from them. This
   dinosaur, dubbed Maiasaura, was an argument in favor of more
   intriguing--and caring--animals than had ever been suspected. Horner
   and Makela named her the "caring mother lizard," and this raised the
   possibility that other species, like the Stegosaurus and Triceratops,
   partook in prolonged parental care.

   But the latest, and greatest, alteration to our understanding of what
   dinosaurs were like came from a critter much smaller than either
   Deinonychus or Maiasaura. A theropod dinosaur, a distant and smaller
   cousin of T. rex and Deinonychus, Sinosauropteryx stood barely a foot
   off the ground. What made this creature fascinating was what covered
   its tiny frame. Instead of scales, its coat was a mane of filamentous
   feathers running along its back.

   When paleontologists Philip Currie and Chen Peiji showed off a snapshot
   of Sinosauropteryx at a meeting in 1996 of the Society of Vertebrate
   Paleontology, their colleagues were astounded. Yale's Ostrom, who had
   long argued for bird-like dinosaurs on the basis of his own Deinonychus
   find as well as other discoveries, told The New York Times that a photo
   put him "in a state of shock." At long last, the crucial soft tissue
   connection between dinosaurs and birds had been discovered. To
   bastardize an Emily Dickinson quote, researchers had found that
   dinosaurs are the things with feathers.

     What made this creature fascinating was what covered its tiny frame.
     Instead of scales, its coat was a mane of filamentous feathers
     running along its back.

   The Sinosauropteryx was just the first of dozens of feathery fossils to
   be found in China. Together, these dinosaurs confirm that birds truly
   are dinosaurs, and that feathers were a feature shared among many
   dinosaur lineages. The 2012 announcement of a 30-foot-long tyrannosaur
   covered in fuzz, named Yutyrannus, has even raised the distinct
   possibility that our cherished T. rex bore a fuzzy coat. This would
   mean a heady revision of how dinosaurs looked and what end they may
   have met.

   Imagine the next Jurassic Park with an angry T. rex covered in feathers
   lunging at the tiny terrified humans. How we see dinosaurs will keep
   changing for as long as we study them, and lesser-known species will
   undoubtedly be at the heart of whatever major transmutations to
   dinosaur imagery come next.

   Just how drastically our most favorite dinosaurs will be changed by
   unsung species is an open-ended question. We haven't even found most
   dinosaurs yet. One 2006 estimate proposed that there may have been
   about 1,850 different types during their Triassic to Cretaceous
   heyday--a run of about 245 to 66 million years ago. If that's so, then
   the 500 or so genera named so far mark the start of our paleontological
   discoveries and might mean more changes for famous and beloved icons
   such as the T. rex. Dinosaurs are anything but set in stone.
