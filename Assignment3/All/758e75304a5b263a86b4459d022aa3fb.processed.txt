   2020: The World According to Qualcomm #Uplinq
   At Uplinq last week Qualcomm showcased a number of future looking
   technologies and I thought I'd try to write them into a story much like
   Corning's Day Made of Glass. This is a world where you are more
   informed, where you are more connected, and where you are better known.
   I continue to explore the idea that with displays all around you the
   one on your phone may become redundant and much like the router in your
   home doesn't need one your on-body hub or router may not either. My
   TechNewsWorld column this week:
