[91]Live blog: 12, plus suspect, dead after Navy Yard shooting

   Shots were [92]fired Monday at a Washington Navy Yard building, killing
   at least 12 people and injuring 14 others, according to local officials
   and the Navy.

   Also killed was a suspect, Aaron Alexis, a 34-year-old military
   information-technology contractor and former full-time Navy reservist
   who lived in Texas, the FBI said. One other gunman may be on the loose,
   police said.

   The incident began about 8:20 a.m. ET when several shots were fired
   inside the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters in the southeast
   portion of the capital. Developments below:

   [Updated at 10:47 p.m. ET] Police released the names and ages of seven
   of the 12 people killed in the shooting. None of the seven was military
   personnel:

   - Michael Arnold, 59
   - Sylvia Frasier, 53
   - Kathy Gaarde, 62
   - John Roger Johnson, 73
   - Frank Kohler, 50
   - Kenneth Bernard Proctor, 46
   - Vishnu Pandit, 61.

   [Updated at 10:40 p.m. ET] Alexis had access to the yard because of his
   contracting work, and he used a valid pass to enter the yard, said
   Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the Washington FBI
   field office.

   [Updated at 10:39 p.m. ET] Besides the 13 people who were killed, eight
   people were injured in Monday morning's shooting, Washington Mayor
   Vincent Gray told reporters Monday night. Three of those were injured
   by gunfire, and the others had other types of injuries, such as
   contusions and chest pain.

   Earlier Monday night, Navy Vice Adm. William D. French said 14 people
   were injured. The 13 dead include suspect Aaron Alexis.

   [Updated at 10:38 p.m. ET] Washington police are confident that only
   one person was involved in Monday morning's shooting, and they are
   lifting a shelter-in-place order for residents who live nearby, Police
   Chief Cathy Lanier said Monday night. Authorities have said suspect
   Aaron Alexis, 34, was killed after an encounter with security.

   [Updated at 9:37 p.m. ET] One of the weapons that Alexis is accused of
   using was purchased recently at a store in northern Virginia, an FBI
   source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told CNN's Pamela
   Brown.

   [Updated at 8:52 p.m. ET] Alexis worked with The Experts, a
   subcontractor working on Hewlett Packard's contracts with the military,
   according to The Experts' chief executive officer, Thomas Hoshko.

   Alexis received secret-level security clearance through the Defense
   Department twice in roughly the past year: Once for an assignment with
   The Experts to work on an HP contract in Japan refreshing computer
   systems late last year and early this year, and again in July for the
   Navy Yard assignment, Hoshko told CNN's Drew Griffin.

   [Updated at 8:43 p.m. ET] The Washington police officer who had surgery
   after being shot in his legs is "alert, he's talkative, and he's doing
   very well," said Janis Orlowski, the chief medical officer at Medstar
   Washington Hospital Center.

   Earlier, CNN's Chris Lawrence reported that doctors will begin to
   determine on Tuesday whether he will be able to keep the legs.

   [Updated at 8:27 p.m. ET] Besides the 13 people who were killed, 14
   people were injured in Monday morning's shooting at the Washington Navy
   Yard, Navy Vice Adm. William D. French told reporters Monday night. The
   13 dead include suspect Aaron Alexis.

   [Updated at 8:26 p.m. ET] About 2,000 people have yet to be released
   from the Washington Navy Yard after Monday morning's shooting there,
   though officials hope to let them go in the next three hours, Navy Vice
   Admiral William D. French told reporters. The military is working with
   the FBI to process people on the base and release them, and officials
   are about halfway through the process, French said.

   [Updated at 8:05 p.m. ET] Adding to what we reported earlier about
   Alexis' movements (see 7:11 p.m. post) - He entered the facility
   legally with a valid ID card, a federal law enforcement official told
   CNN's Susan Candiotti.

   Alexis used a legally purchased AR-15 gun, according to the official.

   [Updated at 8:03 p.m. ET] In Seattle, police say they arrested Alexis
   in 2004 for shooting out the tires of another man's vehicle in what
   Alexis later told detectives was an anger-fueled "blackout."

   [Updated at 7:53 p.m. ET] The wounded Washington police officer who was
   in surgery today at Medstar Washington Hospital Center was shot
   multiple times in the legs, and doctors will begin to determine on
   Tuesday whether he will be able to keep the legs, CNN's Chris Lawrence
   reported.

   [Updated at 7:42 p.m. ET] The names of those killed won't be released
   until 24 hours after the last relative on the entire list is notified
   of the deaths, a Pentagon official told CNN's Barbara Starr. This is
   the same way the Defense Department treats a mass casualty incident in
   a warzone.

   [Updated at 7:11 p.m. ET] Before the shooting, Alexis drove into the
   naval yard with his military contractor identification card, a U.S. law
   enforcement official told CNN's Evan Perez.

   Alexis, armed with three guns, walked into Building 197, made his way
   to an overlook above an atrium, and started shooting, the official
   said.

   [Updated at 6:54 p.m. ET] Multiple law enforcement sources say that
   only one weapon was recovered from the scene of the shooting, CNN's
   Evan Perez and Pamela Brown report. The sources say the weapon was a
   "long gun."

   [Updated at 6:47 p.m. ET] Michael Ritrovato, a friend and former
   roommate of Alexis, told CNN that Alexis was [93]frustrated with the
   company that contracted him to work for the Navy.

   Alexis claimed he wasn't paid properly by the company after returning
   from a months-long assignment to Japan last year, Ritrovato said.

   It was unclear whether the dispute was over salary or expenses. Alexis
   just felt the company owed him money and had not paid him, Ritrovato
   said.

   [Updated at 6:44 p.m. ET] One of Alexis' friends, Nutpisit
   Suthamtewakul, told CNN's Ed Lavandera that [94]he had been Alexis'
   roommate for three years near Fort Worth, Texas, ending a few months
   ago when Suthamtewakul got married.

   Alexis befriended Suthamtewakul four years ago after he emigrated from
   Thailand, and taught Suthamtewakul about American culture,
   Suthamtewakul told CNN. Alexis, he said, was fluent in Thai and
   attended a Buddhist temple.

   When Suthamtewakul opened the Happy Bowl Thai Restaurant, Alexis would
   occasionally help out, waiting tables, he said.

   Suthamtewakul reeled at the news that Alexis was believed to be a
   gunman in the rampage at the Navy Yard.

   "I can't believe he did this," he said. "He never showed any sign of
   violence."

   [Updated at 6:20 p.m. ET] Alexis was discharged from the Navy following
   a "pattern of misconduct," a U.S. defense official told CNN's Barbara
   Starr. Navy records indicate he was a full-time Navy reservist between
   2007 and January 2011.

   [Updated at 6:15 p.m. ET] Investigators still don't know of a motive in
   the shooting, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray said at a news conference moments
   ago.

   And investigators still are looking for a person who, other than
   Alexis, might have been involved in the shootings, Gray said. Like
   before, the description of this person is: a black man in
   military-style drab-olive clothing, about 50 years old, and about 5
   feet 10 inches tall, with gray sideburns.

   Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier said that one of the three wounded
   people being treated at MedStar Washington Hospital Center - a
   Washington police officer - is out of surgery and is in a stable
   condition.

   "We know he's going to be OK," Lanier said. The other two patients also
   are expected to survive, a hospital official told reporters earlier.

   [Updated at 6:02 p.m. ET] When asked whether Alexis was authorized to
   be at the Navy Yard, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus said that was
   "part of the investigation."

   "The only thing we know was that at one point, he was a Navy
   contractor. Whether he was today, I don't know," Mabus told CNN's Wolf
   Blitzer.

   [Updated at 5:56 p.m. ET] Alexis was most recently a Navy contractor
   working in the area of information technology, Secretary of the Navy
   Ray Mabus said.

   We previously noted that Alexis left the Navy in January 2011 as an
   aviation electrician's mate 3rd class, after a nearly four-year Navy
   career. Mabus said that Alexis worked on airplane electrical systems.

   [Updated at 5:25 p.m. ET] Navy Capt. Mark Vandroff says he was in a
   meeting on the third floor of the yard's Building 197 on Monday morning
   when he heard someone shouting about gunshots being fired there.

   "Lock the doors! Lock the doors," the person shouted, according to
   Vandroff.

   He and others took shelter in a conference room and in other rooms, and
   they lay on the floor for about an hour and a half, occasionally
   texting colleagues to get information about their situations. Over the
   course of about 40 minutes, gunshots could be heard intermittently, he
   said.

   At one point, Vandroff said, two bullets were fired through the walls
   of the conference room where he was waiting.

   Vandroff said all 60 of the people who report to him got out alive, but
   he was told that one of his friends in the building died.

   "That's been hard to process," he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.

   Building 197 is one of three Naval Sea Systems Command buildings at the
   yard. The command acquires and maintains ships and submarines and their
   systems; Vandroff said his group is in charge of non-nuclear surface
   ships.

   "I was very proud of my people. We were all afraid, but no one
   panicked," he said.

   [Updated at 4:44 p.m. ET] More about Alexis: He was last known to live
   in Fort Worth, Texas, but was born in Queens, New York, according to
   the FBI.

   He enlisted in the Navy in May 2007 and left as an aviation
   electrician's mate 3rd class in January 2011, according to Navy
   records.

   [Updated at 4:40 p.m. ET] The FBI has released the following pictures
   of Alexis. The bureau is asking people with any information about him
   to call it at 1-800-CALL-FBI. The FBI is looking for information about
   his recent movements and "his contacts and his associates," said
   Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the Washington FBI
   Field Office, at a news conference in Washington.

   [Updated at 4:34 p.m. ET] Authorities still are looking for a person
   who, beyond Alexis, might have been involved in the shootings, D.C.
   Mayor Vincent Gray said. The description of this person remains as it
   was before: a black man in military-style drab-olive clothing, about 50
   years old, and about 5 feet 10 inches tall.

   [Updated at 4:31 p.m. ET] Alexis died while engaged in a gunfire
   exchange with police officers and did not kill himself, Washington
   Police Chief Cathy Lanier and D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray said at a news
   conference.

   [Updated at 4:24 p.m. ET] Twelve people, plus the shooter, killed in
   the Washington Navy Yard shooting, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray said moments
   ago.

   [Updated at 4:13 p.m. ET] Of the three wounded people who are being
   treated at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, two are Navy employees
   and one is a Washington Metropolitan Police Department officer,
   according to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus.

   [Updated at 4:09 p.m. ET] We'll have more information about the dead
   suspect, Aaron Alexis, shortly. Right now, here are some details about
   the three wounded people who were taken to MedStar Washington Hospital
   Center, according to the hospital's chief medical officer, Janis
   Orlowski:

   All three were talking when they arrived, and they are expected to have
   at least a good, if not full, recovery. One man is in surgery, having
   suffered gunshot wounds to the lower extremities, Orlowski said.

   The two other wounded victims are women. One is in surgery for a
   shoulder wound. Just before the surgery, she in was in "very good
   spirits," Orlowski said.

   The third patient is a "very, very lucky young lady," Orlowski said.
   This woman has injuries to her hand and head - and the the bullet wound
   to the head did not penetrate bone, according to Orlowski. "Obviously
   she has suffered a significant wound, but she will recover without
   surgery," Orlowski said.

   [Updated at 3:55 p.m. ET] The dead suspect was Aaron Alexis, a
   34-year-old military contractor from Texas, the Washington FBI field
   office told CNN's Pamela Brown.

   Alexis was identified through fingerprints and an identification card
   that was on the suspect's body, the FBI field office said.

   [Updated at 3:51 p.m. ET] We're expecting a news conference to begin
   soon at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where victims of the
   shooting were sent. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus is expected to be among
   the speakers. Minutes ago, he tweeted that he was at the center to meet
   with victims.

   evacuees and their loved ones, has postponed the game it was scheduled
   to play tonight against the visiting Atlanta Braves.

   "All of us here in the Nationals organization were deeply saddened to

   from Nationals Park. Our thoughts and prayers remain with our friends
   at the Navy Yard and those impacted by today's incident," the team said

   All other afterschool programming is on as scheduled," she said.

   [Updated at 2:42 p.m. ET] At this stage of the investigation,
   authorities have no reason to believe the Navy Yard shootings were a
   terrorist attack, said Mayor Vincent Gray. Police have yet to determine
   a motive, said Washington Police Chief Cathy Lanier.

   [Updated at 2:05 p.m. ET] At Washington Nationals' baseball stadium Lot
   B, where people have gathered to reunite with their loved ones, the
   evacuees from the Navy Yard have not yet arrived. There is no timeline
   for when the buses carrying them are expected to arrive.

   Jacqueline Alston said she hasn't heard from her husband of 18 years,
   Ernest , who has worked as a custodial worker in Building 197 since
   2008.

   "Right now, only God is there with me. Right now, I'm asking God to let

   affiliate WJLA, which cites the Naval Sea Systems Command as its
   source.

   [Updated at 1:33 p.m. ET] Some background on the Navy Yard:

   The 3,000-employee facility has a an annual budget of almost $30
   billion.

   It is the Navy's oldest land establishment, created by act of Congress
   in 1799, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Located
   along the Anacostia River, it was initially intended as a shipbuilding
   facility and once serviced the Navy's most famous vessels, including
   the USS Constitution.

   But after it was burned during the War of 1812, the Navy Yard was
   transformed into a center for ordnance and technological development.
   The facility was the world's largest ordnance plant during World War
   II, but its military role diminished during the Cold War. Today, it
   includes the headquarters for Naval District Washington and a naval
   museum.

   [Updated at 1:21 p.m.] In announcing that three shooting victims
   transported to MedStar Washington Hospital Center are expected to

   other "individuals at the scene who will not be transported because
   they are deceased."

   The other three victims - one of whom was shot in the shoulder and
   another who was shot in the head - were transported via helicopter and
