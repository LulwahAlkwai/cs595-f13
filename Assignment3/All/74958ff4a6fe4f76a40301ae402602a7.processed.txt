[40]Time Magazine's "America's Weak and Waffling" Cover Not Featured in
America

   [41]Zenon Evans|Sep. 16, 2013 3:59 pm

   Time magazine featured a critique of the United States' foreign policy
   and an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin [42]on the cover of
   its September 16^th edition. American readers did not see the critique,
   which ran throughout the rest of the world. The U.S. edition focused
   instead on college football.

   Time Credit: Screencap, Time.com

   The international edition, which is divided into three regions (Europe,
   the Middle East, and Africa; Asia; and the South Pacific) all
   [43]declare "America's weak and waffling, Russia's rich and resurgent."
   In the U.S, Time's cover [44]states, "It's Time To Pay College
   Athletes." The Putin story is tucked in the corner and neutrally
   retitled, "What Putin Wants."

   Neil Munro of the Daily Caller [45]insists that the magazine is
   deliberately "shielding Americans from the demoralizing picture...
   safely overlook[ing] a widely perceived fumble by President Barack
   Obama that left Russia to carry the ball in the Syrian war."

   The Atlantic's Philip Bump sarcastically [46]questions, "Or maybe it
   was trying to shield the rest of the world from the divisive issue of
   whether or not we should pay college athletes (which we presume is also
   Obama's fault)?" The article goes on to defend the practice: "Time, an
   American magazine, has America-specific features all the time... This
   isn't a conspiracy; it's marketing."

   Yet, the article about Putin is America-specific in its subtitle, and
   mentions the U.S. [47]another four times in the first three paragraphs.

   Bump is correct in that the international editions pay no heed to
   American football. However, they do feature an [48]article about
   China's space program that is not even in the American magazine. The
   article, "Under a Chinese Moon," is quick to reference the U.S. The
   subtitle states, "Beijing's commitment to manned space flight is a
   reminder of what the U.S. could once do." The piece begins with a harsh
   take on the U.S.:

     Want to hear a piece of utter non-news? The U.S. is sending an
     unmanned spacecraft to the moon this month. Want to hear a piece of
     very big news? China is sending an unmanned spacecraft to the moon
     this year. That expedition is huge, even cosmically game changing.
     More to the point, it's perfectly legit to respond to such similar
     missions in such dissimilar ways.

   As BuzzFeed [49]acknowledges, covers are typically the same across the
   board. However, the site presents comparisons of various editions that
   inexplicably leave American readers out of the discussion of hot-button
   issues, even ones that directly involve the U.S. These include covers
   that [50]read, "Why the U.S. Will Never Save Afghanistan," and describe
   the "squandered hope" of America's military efforts. Others ranging in
   coverage from China's industrial power, to Europe's economic stability,
   and civil unrest in Pakistan are replaced with lighthearted images like
   school children and house pets for the U.S. audience.

       Lufthansa (and I'm sure many other airlines) hands out magazines to
       business class travelers, and Time is one of them you can choose
       from. I'd be curious to see which version of this week's cover
       they're handing out outbound from the US and inbound to the US.

       Americans are just as likely to be on returning flights as
       departing ones. Plus I doubt they would switch magazine stores
       between flights.

       Can't be. I have been told that Obama handled Syria [89]like a fox.

     It's been awesome to watch today as all the jerking knees quieted a
     little and all the instant judgments of the past month ceded to a
     deeper acknowledgment (even among Republicans) of what had actually
     been substantively achieved: something that, if it pans out, might
     be truly called a breakthrough - not just in terms of Syria, but
     also in terms of a better international system, and in terms of
     Iran.

       They should be able to sell their own merch, autographs, and get
       appearance fees, etc. without it being an NCAA violation. A
       scholarship is a great compensation for the third string TE. But a
       star QB, who could make extra money for selling an autograph,
       should be able to do so. This is America after all. Get paid.

       Russia's rich and resurgent
       1) They're not rich. Their economy makes America's look great.
       2) They're not resurgent. This little snafu aside, Russia is losing
       Syria. This is a few years after they barely won a war against
       Georgia. They can't pacify Chechnya or its neighbors. Their
       reliance on natgas is going to kill them because the world has
       oodles of the stuff. Russia is at odds with almost all of its

       This isn't a conspiracy; it's marketing.
       Maybe that's true. MSNBC undoubtedly takes a progressive stance to
       market to progressives, just as Fox News takes a conservative
       stance to market to conservatives, and HLN takes an idiotic stance
       to market to idiots.
       But last I checked, Time at least tried to market itself as a
       substantive news magazine that dealt with important issues.

       Well they can't be trusted to report any issues of the day honestly
       which may be why americans only buy their mags when there are
       puppies ob the cover. Whenever I would have to do a paper in
       schooln and was looking for references, Time was always the most
       one sided and sensational of any of the news mags. US News and
       World Report blew then away although I think they've gone done hill
       since then. Too many brainwashed kids coming out of journalism
       school I guess.

       it's perfectly legit to respond to such similar missions in such

       Does anyone else here think that between Snowden and Syria, Putin
       is gunning for a Nobel Peace Prize. Or at least Time's Man of the

       Holy shit, international Time is as anti-American as al-Jazeera.
       The fawning over Russia's "wealth" is especially telling. Most

       Russia's going down with them.
