   Samsung Gear vs. Qualcomm Toq: The Unbattle of he Smartphones #uplinq
   My TGDaily column looks at both of these devices and suggests they
   don't really compete because they appeal to very different audiences
   and have very different overall goals. Samsung wants to figure out what
   people want in a watch and without Apple to guide them have created an
   everything but the kitchen sink product, kind of a Swiss army knife of
   stuff most of which you phone can do better. The Toq is a very
   different beast showcasing a few Qualcomm technologies that are market
   leading which including music control (All Join) and the amazing
   Mirasol display which won't wash out outdoors and gives it a thinner
   profile and much longer battery life. But both of these products
   anticipate a next generation device which will be far more attractive.
   In the piece I explain who will want these devices and I'm beginning to
   think the entire class is in anticipation of something far bigger which
   will revolutionize the Smartphone market, something I'll cover later
   this week. TGDaily column here:
