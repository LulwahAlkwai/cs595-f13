T/F - No Explanation needed VS T/F-Explanation needed.

   One of the comments on my blog on[5] Types of question for exams

     A True/False math question where they have to prove their answer. A
     student who picks the wrong answer can figure that out during the
     proof and then correct their answer. A student who picks the wrong
     answer and proves it has proven they really don't have a clue

   Actually I once did an experiment about this! It's only one so I don't
   know what to read into it, but I will describe it and speculate.
   CMSC 250 is the Sophomore Discrete Math course, required for all
   majors. CS 3 is a co-req. It's a course on how to prove simple things.
   We DO go over how a FOR ALL statement can be true vacuously (E.g.,all
   of the students over  10 feet tall will get an A+). Around 150 students
   take the course. In the spring there is an honors section of about 20.
   I PLANNED the following:

     *  In Spring of 2008 one of the questions on the final was a set of
       FIVE statements where the students had to, for each statement, say
       if its TRUE or FALSE and NO JUSTIFICATION NECC. One of the
       statements was  If A is a set of natural numbers such that the
       powerset of A has 5 elements then A is infinite.

     *  In Spring of 2010 one of the questions on the final was a set of
       FIVE statement where the students had to, for each statement, say
       if it's TRUE or FALSE and IF TRUE THEN GIVE A SHORT JUSTIFICATION,
       IF FALSE THEN GIVE A COUNTEREXAMPLE.

   Note that the statement is TRUE since there are NO such sets A.
   So,  how did they do?

    1. When NOT needing to justify or give a counterexample, of the 150
       students in the class, 14 got it right. There was no correlation
       (or perhaps a very weak one) between those who got it right and
       those who did well in the course or those that were in the honors
       section.
    2. When the DID need to justify or give counterexample, of the 152
       students in the class, 19 got it right. Slightly stronger
       correlation to those who got it right and those who did well in the
       course and to those in the honors section.

   I would say the 5 extra students and the slightly better correlation is
   too small to care about. I was surprised--- I thought being forced to
   find a countexample would help them along. But this is a rather
   tricky question which some non-theory faculty members had trouble with
   when I explained this story to them. Exam Pressure was likely NOT a
   factor as my exams have very little time pressure- by the end of the
   exam
   there were only about 30 students left taking it.
   Here are the answers I got:
    1. FALSE- clearly A is finite.
    2. FALSE- too obvious to say why.
    3. FALSE- there is no such A
    4. Variants of the above.
    5. Incoherent things that may be similar to the above.

    UPSHOTS: This is a failed experiment in that I didn't prove or
   disprove the hypothesis that asking students to justify makes more
   students get it. Of course, even if I had shown that it would only be
   for this one problem. I DID show that this problem is trickier than I
   thought.  I may try this again with a less tricky problem.

       A clearly has ~2.32 elements and is thus finite.

       I found this to be a terrible question (though I admit that, on
       first reading, I got it wrong). What exactly were you trying to
       test? Their knowledge of power sets, or their ability to parse
       logical statements? If the former, I would have just asked "Is
       there a set whose power set has 5 elements?" If the latter, I would
       have asked "Is the following statement true or false: for all A,
       (P(A) has 5 elements) => A is infinite."

       Anon 1- I suspect someone has devised a set theory where a set
       really
       can have a powerset of 5 elements. Fuzzy set theory? Some sort of
       Prob?
       Anon 2- I was trying to test BOTH things, which may be why so many
       got it wrong. Was it a terrible question? It did not correlate with
       other measures of who the good students are, so in that rigorous
       sense YES it was a terrible question. It might be good as a
       HW/discussion question. Since some said it
       was OBVIOUSLY false it could also lead to a good discussion about
       the need
       for rigorous thinking.

       If I had been taking your exam, I would've walked up to you and
       asked, "Do you mean exactly 5 elements or at least 5 elements?" The
       wording is ambiguous, I think; a set can have 5 elements in it
       without those being the only 5.

       For a introductory math subject, one quiz question was a
       two-parter, where the first part required them to do some simple
       algebra to obtain a result, and the second part required them to
       use a different technique to verify the result. One student made a
       mistake in the first part, so got the wrong result. They then
       fudged the verification, essentially by skipping the penultimate
       step and going straight to the conclusion that the original result
       was correct.
       Of course, this "verification" didn't deserve any credit: either
       the student didn't know the technique, or missed the point of the
       question. Surprisingly, the student came up to me after receiving
       his graded quiz and attempted to argue that he should have got
       credit since the error in part b was a consequence of the error in
       part a. Talk about missing the point! He would have gotten credit
       if he'd pointed out that his part a answer was incorrect, but he
       didn't see satisfied with that!

       I second Anon 2: this is a very poor question.

       What about a universally quantified statement that is false and if
       you try to prove it true you get to a point where "5 < 3" needs to
       be true. A student who gets there and puts a QED after that had a
       chance to see their answer was wrong but just mechanically did a
       proof without understanding what they were doing and moved on.

       Off topic again: does anybody know when are the STOC 2014 and CCC
       2014 call for papers announced? (The level of unprofessionality is
       astounding.)

       The question hinges around whether the respondent is expected to
       include the "if" as part of the question. That is, are they
       expected to say whether "|- X => Y" is true, or are they expected
       to choose between "X |- Y is true" "and X |- Y is false".
       All three of these statements are correct, so I don't think it's a
       fair question to eliminate "false" as a correct answer.
       If they have to explain their answer, then of course you might say
       they answered "false" for the wrong reason.

       I had a sophomore math class MIT (18.25: groups, rings, fields)
       where our grade was based on 3 open-ended, open book exams
       consisting of 10 True / False questions. Scoring for each exam was
       +10 for the right answer, -10 for the wrong answer, 0 for no
       answer, but +200 for the exam if you had 10 wrong answers. Needless
       to say, there were more than a few -80 scores.
