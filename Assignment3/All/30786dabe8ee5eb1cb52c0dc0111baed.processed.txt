   By Emily Price2013-09-18 01:17:45 UTC

   Apple's newest flagship smartphone, the [48]iPhone 5S, doesn't hit
   stores until Sept. 20. Some reviewers, however, have already had the
   opportunity to spend a few days with the smartphone.

   So, what are they all saying?

   The iPhone 5S's biggest claim to fame is its [49]new Touch ID
   fingerprint scanner. The scanner stores a virtual picture of your
   fingerprint, and enables you to unlock your phone, or even make iTunes
   purchases using your finger as a password.

   Engadget reviewer Myriam Joire found the setup process for the phone's
   Touch ID [50]simple, noting that it took less than a minute for the
   handset to pick up prints.

   Joire said, "The scanner was able to pick up all of our fingers in
   fractions of a second and from any angle. It's so natural, in fact,
   that we almost forgot that passwords and unlock screens even existed on
   the 5S; on countless occasions we tried to unlock the iPhone 5 and 5C
   with the scanner before realizing that we had to use the
   'old-fashioned' slide-to-unlock method."

   See also: [51]iPhone 5S vs. the Competition

   The 5S' camera also [52]saw a huge upgrade, adding a wider f/2.2
   aperture and new camera sensor, which is 15% larger than before. What's
   more, a new burst mode lets you take 10 photos in one second, and
   videos can be recorded in slow motion.

   New York Times reviewer David Pogue [53]was impressed with the camera
   on the 5S, saying that it was one of the most noticeable feature
   changes.

   "Its sensor is 15% bigger, and the individual light-detecting pixels
   are bigger. Take photos side-by-side with the iPhone 5S' predecessor,
   and the difference is immediately obvious," Pogue said. "Lowlight
   pictures are far better on the new phone. Clearer, brighter, better
   color."

   Pogue added that the camera's flash is particularly impressive: "Flash
   photos look much, much better. No longer will your loved ones' skin
   look either nuclear white or 'Avatar' blue."

   Here are some snippets from early reviews that have hit the web:

   [54]Engadget: "The 5s is a solid effort from Apple, but its true worth
   is yet to be determined. If developers come up with clever ways of
   using the 64-bit support, iOS 7 and M7 coprocessor to their advantage,
   the 5s has the potential of being the best off-year flagship phone the
   company has made. If not, a lot of people might just wait it out
   another year."

   [55]Techradar: "The iPhone 5S is a phone that takes everything Apple
   has learned in this space over the last six and a half years and put it
   together in an incredibly cohesive manner."

   [56]CNET: "The iPhone 5S is not a required upgrade, but it's easily the
   fastest and most advanced Apple smartphone to date."

   [57]Slashgear: "Would we pick the iPhone 5s over the iPhone 5c? In a
   heartbeat. The camera, convenience, and performance increases make that
   a no-brainer decision for smartphone power users. That trifecta of
   talents also makes a strong case against the top-tier Android devices,
   too: Apple still dominates the market for hand-friendly phones with
   flagship performance."

   [58]The Loop: "If you're the type of person that always has to have the
   latest and greatest gadget, then this is the device for you."

   [59]New York Times: "Apple still believes in superb design and
   tremendous polish. The iPhone is no longer the only smartphone that
   will keep you delighted for the length of your two-year contract -- but
   it's still among the few that will."

   [60]All Things Digital: "Then there's the new operating system on this
   phone, called iOS 7. Its new look, new user interface and new functions
   represent the biggest overhaul to the iPhone's core software since the
   original model launched in 2007."

   [61]Pocket-lint: "Not once have we thought anything took too long to
   load. But if you are an iPhone 5 user expecting the 5S to be twice the
   speed of what you've been using, you'll find that's not the case."

   The iPhone 5S will be available on Sept. 20 at 8 a.m. local time in
   nine countries: the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany,
   Japan, Singapore and the UK. It will be available in Apple Stores,
   [62]mobile carriers, and big-box retailers such as Best Buy and
   [63]Walmart. Similar to previous generations, the 5S will come with 16,
   32 or 64 GB of storage for $199, $299 and $399, respectively. The phone
   is launching in three colors: gold, silver and space gray.

Hands On With the iPhone 5S

    1. Apple-event-26

Introducing the iPhone 5S
       Apple unveiled the iPhone 5S -- along with a lower cost iPhone 5C
       -- at its Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, marking the first time
       two iPhone devices launched on the same day.
    2. Apple-event-24

iPhone 5S: Gold, Silver and Black
       The iPhone 5S -- which comes in gold, silver and black -- has the
       same overall physical design as the previous-generation iPhone 5,
       but it also has a number of upgrades.
    3. Apple-event-15

Sleek and Light
       The iPhone 5S measures in at 4.87 inches high, 2.31 inches wide and
       0.30 inches deep. It weighs less than 4 ounces -- 3.95 to be exact.
    4. Apple-event-17

Touch ID
       The iPhone 5S will include a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, allowing
       users to unlock their device with the touch of a finger.
    5. Apple-event-18

Fingerprint Sensor Technology
       Not only will this be a huge step forward in smartphone protection,
       it can also be used to make iTunes purchases. Instead of typing in
       a password every time you buy a song or app, pressing your
       fingerprint against the scanner will bypass that step.
    6. Apple-event-29

App Innovation
       Apple has re-engineered all the built-in apps -- such as Mail,
       Calendar and iPod -- for 64-bit architectures.
    7. Apple-event-14

Faster Processor
       The iPhone 5S comes with a powerful new processor: the Apple A7. It
       packs more than 1 billion transistors into a 102mm chip. It can run
       64-bit apps (all previous models ran at 32 bits).
    8. Apple-event-13

Improved Camera
       The iPhone's camera comes with major improvements, thanks to new
       sensors that have 15% more area and an f/2.2 aperture. It also
       comes with a dual-LED flash and new software features, such as
       filters and a burst mode that snaps 10 still pictures in one second
       with automatic image stabilization.
    9. Apple-event-22

Photo Collections
       Apple is making it easier to group photos and videos based on time
       and place. It's displayed almost like a mosaic on screen.
   10. Apple-event-21

Photo Sorting
       Photos can also be sorted by year.
   11. Apple-event-20

Panoramics
       The panorama feature captures a scene at an impressive 30 frames
       for each second. This is 50% faster than the iPhone 5.
   12. Apple-event-1

HD Video Recording
       The iPhone 5S lets you film in 1080p HD and touts a slow-motion
       feature at 120 frames for each second in 720p. This means you can
       take footage in regular speed and slow it down, for example, during
       a dramatic moment.
   13. Apple-event-16

iPhone 5S Cases
       Apple also launched a new lineup of iPhone 5 cases in a variety of
       colors.
   14. Apple-event-19

Availability
       The iPhone 5S will go on sale Sept. 20 in nine countries: the
       United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and
       the UK. Like previous generations, it will come with 16, 32 or 64GB
       of storage for $199, $299 and $399, respectively -- as long as you
       sign a two-year contract with AT&T, Verizon or Sprint (T-Mobile's
       installment pricing is somewhat different).
