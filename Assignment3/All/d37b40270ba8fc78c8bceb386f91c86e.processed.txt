   Why Microsoft is Not Distributing Windows 8.1 early.
   Point products are designed to be compatible with apps and devices with
   drivers that worked on the prior .0 offering so the need to distribute
   the code is vastly reduced. In addition by delaying the release of the
   product till launch there is a chance, if people don't write a ton
   about the delay, they can better control the message and focus people
   on the positive an new and now the annoyance of changes (we really
   don't like change much) and since Windows 8 users, who might be annoyed
   by some of the changes, are the most likely to do the early unfavorable
   reviews this is likely a good thing. In the end 8.1 is designed to
   appeal to those currently not on 8 not those that have made the jump,
   and for that Microsoft wants the best shot to put their best foot
   forward. What prompted my comment is Ed Bott's excellent piece on the
   Microsoft decision not to distribute 8.1 early:
